## Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Model

### Overview

The Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model is a paradigmatic model in the theory of spin glasses, introduced by David Sherrington and Scott Kirkpatrick in 1975. It is a mean-field model, meaning that each spin interacts with every other spin in the system. This model has been instrumental in developing the theoretical understanding of disordered systems and has applications in various fields, including condensed matter physics, optimization, and neural networks.

### Definition and Mathematical Formalism

The SK model is defined by the following Hamiltonian:

$$
H = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{i<j} J_{ij} S_i S_j
$$

where:
- $S_i \in \{ \pm 1 \}$ represents the spin at site $i$.
- $J_{ij}$ represents the interaction strength between spins $i$ and $j$.
- $N$ is the total number of spins.
- The factor $\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}$ ensures that the energy remains extensive (proportional to $N$) as the system size grows.

### Interaction Strengths

The interaction strengths $J_{ij}$ are typically chosen from a Gaussian distribution with mean zero and variance $1$:

$$
P(J_{ij}) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \exp \left( -\frac{J_{ij}^2}{2} \right)
$$

This randomness introduces disorder into the system, which is a defining feature of spin glasses.

### Key Concepts

#### Replica Method and Replica Symmetry Breaking (RSB)

The replica method is a mathematical technique used to handle the [[quenched disorder in spin glass systems]]. The idea is to replicate the system $n$ times and average over the disorder before taking the limit as $n \to 0$. This approach leads to the concept of replica symmetry breaking (RSB), which describes how the symmetry between the replicas is broken in the low-temperature phase, resulting in a complex landscape of many metastable states.

The order parameter in the SK model is the overlap $q_{ab}$ between two replicas $a$ and $b$:

$$
q_{ab} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N S_i^a S_i^b
$$

Replica symmetry breaking occurs when the distribution of overlaps becomes non-trivial, indicating a multitude of different equilibrium states.

#### Phase Transition

The SK model exhibits a phase transition from a paramagnetic phase at high temperatures to a spin glass phase at low temperatures. The critical temperature $T_c$ can be determined using mean-field theory and is given by:

$$
T_c = 1
$$

for the standard normalization of the interactions.

#### Free Energy

The free energy of the system in the replica symmetric (RS) phase can be calculated using the replica method. In the low-temperature phase, the free energy landscape becomes highly non-trivial due to the emergence of many metastable states, which necessitates the use of replica symmetry breaking techniques to describe it accurately.

### Applications

1. **Optimization**: The SK model is analogous to various optimization problems where finding the ground state corresponds to finding the optimal solution. Techniques developed for studying the SK model have been applied to problems like the Traveling Salesman Problem and the Max-Cut Problem.
2. **Neural Networks**: The Hopfield network, a model for associative memory, can be viewed as a spin glass. The weights in the Hopfield network correspond to the interaction strengths $J_{ij}$ in the SK model.
3. **Condensed Matter Physics**: The SK model helps in understanding the behavior of disordered magnetic materials and the nature of the spin glass phase.

Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Model


**ASSISTANT**

The Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model is a paradigmatic model for understanding [[spin glasses]], which are disordered magnetic systems with complex interactions between spins. The SK model, introduced by David Sherrington and Scott Kirkpatrick in 1975, extends the concept of [[spin glasses]] to a mean-field level, allowing for a comprehensive analytical treatment using methods from statistical physics.

## Overview

The SK model is a mean-field model, meaning that each spin interacts with every other spin in the system. This contrasts with short-range models where spins only interact with their nearest neighbors. The Hamiltonian of the SK model is given by:

$$
H_{\text{SK}} = -\sum_{i < j} J_{ij} s_i s_j
$$

where:
- $s_i \in \{-1, +1\}$ are Ising spins.
- $J_{ij}$ are quenched random couplings, typically drawn from a Gaussian distribution with mean zero and variance $1/N$:
  $$
  P(J_{ij}) = \sqrt{\frac{N}{2\pi}} \exp \left( -\frac{N J_{ij}^2}{2} \right)
  $$
- The factor $1/N$ in the variance ensures that the energy is extensive, i.e., proportional to the number of spins $N$.

## Replica Method

To solve the SK model, the [[replica method]] is used. The key quantity of interest is the disorder-averaged free energy $\langle F \rangle$, which is related to the partition function $Z$ by:

$$
\langle F \rangle = - \frac{1}{\beta} \langle \ln Z \rangle
$$

Here, $\beta = 1/(k_B T)$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the temperature. The partition function is:

$$
Z = \sum_{\{s_i\}} e^{-\beta H_{\text{SK}}}
$$

Directly averaging $\ln Z$ is difficult, so the replica trick is employed:

$$
\langle \ln Z \rangle = \lim_{n \rightarrow 0} \frac{\langle Z^n \rangle - 1}{n}
$$

The replicated partition function $\langle Z^n \rangle$ is then computed for integer $n$, and the result is analytically continued to $n \rightarrow 0$.

### Replica Symmetric Solution

In the replica symmetric (RS) ansatz, the overlap matrix $q_{ab}$, representing the overlap between replicas $a$ and $b$, is assumed to be uniform:

$$
q_{ab} = q \quad \text{for all } a \neq b
$$

The self-consistent equation for $q$ in the RS ansatz is:

$$
q = \int Dz \, \tanh^2 \left( \beta \sqrt{q} z \right)
$$

where $Dz = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-z^2/2} dz$ is the Gaussian measure. However, the RS solution is unstable at low temperatures and does not correctly describe the spin glass phase.

## Replica Symmetry Breaking

Giorgio Parisi introduced the concept of Replica Symmetry Breaking (RSB) to address the shortcomings of the RS solution. In the Parisi solution, the overlap matrix $q_{ab}$ is allowed to have a hierarchical structure, leading to a more accurate description of the spin glass phase.

### Full Replica Symmetry Breaking (FRSB)

In full RSB, the overlap $q(u)$ is a continuous function of a parameter $u \in [0, 1]$. The Parisi order parameter function $q(u)$ satisfies a set of self-consistent equations. The Parisi [[free energy functional]] $F[q(u)]$ is given by:

$$
F[q(u)] = \int_0^1 du \left[ \frac{1}{2} \beta^2 q(u)^2 - \beta \left( 1 - u \right) \ln \left( 1 - q(u) \right) \right]
$$

The order parameter function $q(u)$ is determined by minimizing this functional.

## Physical Interpretation

The Parisi solution reveals several important features of the spin glass phase:

- **Metastable States**: The hierarchical structure of overlaps corresponds to a multitude of metastable states.
- **Ultrametricity**: The distances between states in the overlap space exhibit ultrametricity, a property where the triangle inequality is strengthened to an ultrametric inequality.
- **Aging and Dynamics**: The RSB framework explains aging phenomena in [[spin glasses]], where the system's dynamics depend on its history.

## Applications

The SK model and the Parisi solution have far-reaching implications beyond [[spin glasses]]:

- **Combinatorial Optimization**: Many hard optimization problems, such as the traveling salesman problem and satisfiability, can be mapped onto spin glass models and analyzed using RSB.
- **Neural Networks**: The capacity and dynamics of associative memory models like the Hopfield network are understood using concepts from the SK model.
- **Error-Correcting Codes**: The performance and robustness of error-correcting codes in the presence of noise and disorder are analyzed using the SK model and RSB.
