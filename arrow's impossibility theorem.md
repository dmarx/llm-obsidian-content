Arrow's Impossibility Theorem


**ASSISTANT**

### Arrow's Impossibility Theorem

Arrow's Impossibility Theorem, formulated by economist Kenneth Arrow in 1951, is a fundamental result in [[social choice theory]]. It demonstrates the inherent difficulties in designing a social welfare function that can convert individual preferences into a collective decision while satisfying a set of seemingly reasonable criteria. This theorem has profound implications for the design of [[voting systems]] and collective decision-making processes.

### Key Concepts

1. **Social Welfare Function (SWF)**: A function that aggregates individual preferences into a collective preference order.
2. **Preferences**: Each individual has a preference order over a set of alternatives, usually denoted as a complete, transitive ordering.
3. **Criteria**: The theorem focuses on four main criteria that a reasonable SWF should satisfy.

### Formal Statement

Let \( X \) be a set of at least three alternatives, and let \( N \) be a set of individuals. A social welfare function \( F \) maps the set of individual preference profiles (one for each individual) to a single collective preference order over \( X \).

Arrow's theorem states that no social welfare function \( F \) can simultaneously satisfy the following four criteria:

1. **Unrestricted Domain (Universality)**: The SWF should accommodate any set of individual preferences.
2. **Non-Dictatorship**: No single individual should dictate the social preference regardless of others' preferences.
3. **Pareto Efficiency**: If every individual prefers one alternative over another, the social preference should reflect that preference.
4. **Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA)**: The social preference between any two alternatives should depend only on individuals' preferences between those two alternatives, not on preferences regarding other alternatives.

### Proof Outline

Arrow's proof involves demonstrating that any social welfare function that satisfies unrestricted domain, Pareto efficiency, and independence of irrelevant alternatives must be dictatorial. Here is a high-level outline of the proof:

1. **Construct a Preference Profile**: Consider a profile where individuals have specific preferences over a set of alternatives.
2. **Apply Pareto Efficiency**: Use Pareto efficiency to determine the collective preference order in certain cases.
3. **Apply Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives**: Show that changing preferences on irrelevant alternatives does not affect the social preference between any two alternatives.
4. **Identify the Dictator**: Demonstrate that under these conditions, there must exist an individual (the dictator) whose preferences always determine the social preference, violating non-dictatorship.

### Implications

The implications of Arrow's Impossibility Theorem are profound and far-reaching:

1. **Limitations of Voting Systems**: The theorem highlights the limitations and challenges in designing a fair and consistent voting system that respects individual preferences.
2. **Trade-offs in Mechanism Design**: It underscores the need to make trade-offs among the criteria when designing social choice mechanisms, acknowledging that not all desirable properties can be simultaneously achieved.
3. **Focus on Practical Solutions**: While the theorem proves the impossibility of perfect solutions, it drives the search for practical systems that perform well under certain conditions or relax some of the criteria.

### Related Concepts

#### 1. **Dictatorship**

A social welfare function is dictatorial if there exists a single individual whose preferences always determine the social preference, regardless of others' preferences. Arrow's theorem shows that avoiding dictatorship while satisfying the other criteria is impossible.

#### 2. **Pareto Efficiency**

An outcome is Pareto efficient if no other outcome makes some individuals better off without making others worse off. This criterion ensures that social decisions reflect unanimous individual preferences.

#### 3. **Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA)**

IIA requires that the social preference between any two alternatives depends only on individuals' preferences between those two alternatives. This criterion prevents the social choice from being influenced by changes in preferences regarding irrelevant alternatives.

### Example: Voting Systems

Consider a simple example involving three individuals (\( N = \{1, 2, 3\} \)) and three alternatives (\( X = \{A, B, C\} \)):

1. Individual preferences might be as follows:
   - Voter 1: \( A > B > C \)
   - Voter 2: \( B > C > A \)
   - Voter 3: \( C > A > B \)

2. **Majority Rule**: Using majority rule to aggregate preferences can lead to a cycle:
   - \( A \) beats \( B \) (2 votes to 1).
   - \( B \) beats \( C \) (2 votes to 1).
   - \( C \) beats \( A \) (2 votes to 1).

This cyclic preference illustrates the difficulty in achieving a consistent social preference order, underscoring the challenges highlighted by Arrow's theorem.

### Practical Approaches

Despite Arrow's Impossibility Theorem, several practical approaches are used to design [[voting systems]] that perform reasonably well:

1. **Ranked Choice Voting**: Voters rank alternatives, and votes are transferred according to preferences until a majority winner emerges.
2. **Borda Count**: Voters rank alternatives, and points are assigned based on rankings. The alternative with the highest total points wins.
3. **Single Transferable Vote (STV)**: A proportional representation method where voters rank candidates, and candidates are elected through a process of elimination and vote transfer.

### Conclusion

Arrow's Impossibility Theorem reveals the inherent limitations in designing a perfect social welfare function that respects individual preferences while satisfying key criteria. Understanding this theorem is crucial for economists, political scientists, and policymakers, as it guides the development of more realistic and practical [[voting systems]] and collective decision-making processes.

arrow's impossibility theorem


**ASSISTANT**

[[Arrow's Impossibility Theorem]], formulated by economist Kenneth Arrow in his doctoral thesis and later published in his book "Social Choice and Individual Values" (1951), is a landmark result in social choice theory and economics. The theorem demonstrates a fundamental paradox in voting and collective decision-making systems: it is impossible to design a voting system that simultaneously fulfills a set of seemingly reasonable and desirable criteria for fair and rational collective decision-making. 

### Criteria for a Fair Voting System

Arrow's theorem considers a voting system that tries to aggregate the preferences of individuals over a set of three or more options (or candidates) into a complete, transitive preference ordering for the society as a whole. Arrow defined the following axioms that any fair voting system should satisfy:

1. **Non-Dictatorship:** No single individual's preferences should dictate the group's preference ordering, regardless of the preferences of the other members of the group.

2. **Pareto Efficiency (Unanimity):** If every individual in a group prefers one option over another, then the group preference should also reflect a preference for that option over the other.

3. **Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA):** The group's preference between any two options should not be affected by changes in the ranking of other options. In other words, the ranking between any two options depends only on the individual rankings of these two options, not on whether a third option is available.

4. **Universal Domain (Unrestricted Domain):** The voting system should be able to process any set of individual preferences to produce a group preference. That is, the system should work for any possible configuration of individual rankings of the options.

### Statement of the Theorem

Arrow's impossibility theorem states that no voting system can satisfy all four of these criteria simultaneously if there are three or more options to choose from. This implies that all voting systems must, in some situations, violate at least one of the principles of fairness or rationality as defined by Arrow.

### Mathematical Formalization

To formalize Arrow's theorem, consider a set $A$ of alternatives with $|A| \geq 3$. Let $N$ be a set of individuals. A social welfare function $F$ takes as input a profile of individual preferences (complete, transitive orders over $A$) and produces a complete, transitive social preference order over $A$. Arrow's conditions can be formalized as follows:

1. **Non-Dictatorship:** $\nexists i \in N$ such that for all preference profiles, the social preference order is always the preference order of individual $i$.

2. **Pareto Efficiency:** For any two alternatives $x, y \in A$, if every individual prefers $x$ to $y$, then the social preference should also prefer $x$ to $y$.

3. **Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives:** For any two alternatives $x, y \in A$, the social preference between $x$ and $y$ depends only on the individuals' preferences between $x$ and $y$, unaffected by individuals' preferences regarding other alternatives.

4. **Universal Domain:** The social welfare function $F$ must produce a social preference order for any possible set of individual preference orders over $A$.

Arrow's theorem is then: Given the set of alternatives $A$ where $|A| \geq 3$, there is no social welfare function $F$ that satisfies Non-Dictatorship, Pareto Efficiency, Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives, and Universal Domain simultaneously.

### Implications and Interpretations

The implications of Arrow's theorem are profound, suggesting inherent limitations in the design of collective decision-making processes. It highlights trade-offs that must be considered in the design of electoral systems, decision-making in organizations, and other contexts where group preferences need to be aggregated. The theorem has spurred a vast amount of research in economics, political science, and philosophy, exploring ways to navigate these limitations, alternative axioms, and decision-making frameworks that might circumvent Arrow's constraints.
