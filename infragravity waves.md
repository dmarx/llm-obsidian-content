### Infragravity Waves

**Infragravity waves** are ocean surface [[gravity waves]] with periods typically ranging from 30 seconds to 5 minutes, longer than wind-driven sea and swell waves but shorter than tides. These waves play a significant role in coastal processes, influencing beach morphology, sediment transport, and coastal flooding.

### Key Characteristics

1. **Wave Period and Frequency**:
   - **Period**: Infragravity waves have periods ranging from about 30 seconds to 5 minutes, corresponding to frequencies between approximately 0.005 Hz and 0.03 Hz. This places them between wind-generated waves (periods of 1â€“30 seconds) and tides (periods of hours).
   - **Frequency Band**: The frequency range of infragravity waves is typically between 0.005 Hz (200 seconds) and 0.03 Hz (33 seconds).

2. **Generation Mechanisms**:
   - **Nonlinear Wave-Wave Interactions**: Infragravity waves are often generated by nonlinear interactions between groups of shorter, wind-generated waves (sea and swell). When groups of sea and swell waves approach the shore, they generate low-frequency wave energy due to the variation in wave group amplitude.
   - **Bound Waves**: One common mechanism involves the generation of "bound" infragravity waves that are tied to the wave groups. These waves are initially phase-locked to the wave groups but become free waves after the wave groups break nearshore.
   - **Edge Waves**: Infragravity waves can also manifest as edge waves, which are trapped along the coastline and propagate along the shore while oscillating in and out from the shoreline.

3. **Propagation**:
   - **Shallow Water Influence**: Infragravity waves behave as shallow water waves because their wavelengths are long compared to the water depth, especially near the coast. Their speed is influenced by the depth of the water, governed by the shallow water wave speed relation \( c = \sqrt{gh} \), where \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity and \( h \) is the water depth.
   - **Dissipation**: As infragravity waves propagate shoreward, they lose energy due to bottom friction, [[wave breaking]], and interaction with the coastal topography.

4. **Impact on Coastal Dynamics**:
   - **Runup and Coastal Flooding**: Infragravity waves contribute significantly to wave runup and coastal flooding, particularly during storms. Their longer periods allow them to penetrate further onto the shore, leading to increased water levels and potential overtopping of coastal defenses.
   - **Beach Morphology**: The oscillatory motion of infragravity waves influences sediment transport, leading to beach erosion or accretion. They are particularly important in shaping the foreshore and nearshore regions.

### Mathematical Description

1. **Shallow Water Wave Equations**:
   - **Linear Wave Theory**: Infragravity waves can be described by the linear shallow water wave equations when the water depth is much smaller than the wavelength. The phase speed \( c \) of these waves is given by:
     $$
     c = \sqrt{gh}
     $$
     where \( g \) is the gravitational acceleration, and \( h \) is the local water depth.

2. **Wave-Group Forcing**:
   - **Wave Groups**: Infragravity waves are often generated by the modulation of wave groups. The varying amplitude of the groups generates a fluctuating pressure at the seabed, which in turn drives the formation of infragravity waves.
   - **Longuet-Higgins and Stewart (1962)**: A key theory explaining the generation of infragravity waves is based on the work of Longuet-Higgins and Stewart, who showed that the modulation of wave groups can generate low-frequency waves that propagate with the groups but can become free waves as they approach shallow water.

3. **Edge Waves**:
   - **Trapped Modes**: Edge waves are a specific type of infragravity wave that is trapped near the shoreline due to refraction. These waves have a characteristic spatial structure that depends on the shape of the coastline and the bathymetry. They can be described mathematically using solutions to the shallow water wave equations with boundary conditions representing the shoreline.

### Generation and Observations

1. **Field Observations**:
   - **Coastal Measurements**: Infragravity waves are commonly measured using pressure sensors and wave buoys deployed in coastal areas. These instruments capture the low-frequency oscillations associated with infragravity waves.
   - **Spectral Analysis**: The presence of infragravity waves is often identified through spectral analysis of wave data, which reveals a peak in energy at frequencies corresponding to the infragravity band.

2. **Laboratory Experiments**:
   - **Wave Tanks**: Controlled experiments in wave tanks can be used to study the generation and behavior of infragravity waves. These experiments allow researchers to simulate the effects of wave groups and coastal topography on infragravity wave generation.

3. **Numerical Modeling**:
   - **Boussinesq Models**: Numerical models based on the Boussinesq equations are often used to simulate the generation, propagation, and dissipation of infragravity waves. These models account for nonlinear interactions and the influence of varying bathymetry.
   - **SWASH Model**: The SWASH (Simulating WAves till SHore) model is a specialized numerical tool that simulates the full range of wave motions, including infragravity waves, from deep water to the shoreline.

### Importance of Infragravity Waves

1. **Coastal Engineering**:
   - **Design Considerations**: Infragravity waves must be considered in the design of coastal structures, such as breakwaters, seawalls, and storm surge barriers. Their impact on runup and overtopping can influence the stability and effectiveness of these structures.
   - **Beach Nourishment**: Understanding infragravity waves is also important for beach nourishment projects, where sediment is added to the beach to combat erosion. Infragravity waves influence sediment transport and deposition patterns.

2. **Coastal Hazard Assessment**:
   - **Storm Surges and Tsunamis**: During extreme weather events, such as storms and [[tsunamis]], infragravity waves can amplify water levels, leading to increased flooding and damage. Accurate predictions of infragravity wave behavior are essential for hazard assessment and early warning systems.
   - **Climate Change Impact**: As sea levels rise and storm intensity increases due to climate change, the role of infragravity waves in coastal processes is expected to become more significant, leading to greater risks of coastal flooding and erosion.

3. **Environmental Impacts**:
   - **Ecosystem Influence**: Infragravity waves influence the distribution of nutrients and sediments in coastal ecosystems, affecting habitats such as coral reefs, seagrass beds, and mangroves. Their role in shaping the physical environment has implications for the health and resilience of these ecosystems.

### Conclusion

**Infragravity waves** are an important component of coastal dynamics, characterized by their long periods and significant influence on coastal processes. Generated primarily by nonlinear interactions within wave groups and the modulation of shorter waves, infragravity waves affect wave runup, sediment transport, and coastal morphology. Understanding their behavior is crucial for coastal engineering, hazard assessment, and environmental management, especially in the context of rising sea levels and increasing storm intensity. Advances in field measurements, laboratory experiments, and numerical modeling continue to improve our knowledge of these complex and impactful waves.
