# Multiresolution Analysis

## Definition

Multiresolution Analysis (MRA) is a mathematical framework used in wavelet theory to analyze and represent functions at multiple levels of resolution. MRA provides a systematic way to decompose a function into components that capture different scales of detail, enabling efficient representation and analysis of functions with localized features.

## Key Concepts

### Function Spaces

MRA is based on a sequence of nested function spaces \( V_j \), each representing the function at a different resolution level. These spaces have the following properties:

1. **Nested Spaces**: \( \cdots \subset V_{-1} \subset V_0 \subset V_1 \subset \cdots \)
2. **Approximation Property**: Any function \( f \) in \( L^2(\mathbb{R}) \) can be approximated arbitrarily well by functions in \( V_j \) as \( j \to \infty \).
3. **Scaling Property**: Functions in \( V_{j+1} \) can be expressed in terms of functions in \( V_j \) by scaling.

### Scaling Function

The scaling function \( \phi(t) \), also known as the father wavelet, generates the function spaces \( V_j \). It satisfies the two-scale relation:

$$
\phi(t) = \sqrt{2} \sum_{k} h_k \phi(2t - k)
$$

where \( h_k \) are the scaling coefficients.

### Wavelet Function

The wavelet function \( \psi(t) \), also known as the mother wavelet, generates the detail spaces \( W_j \), which capture the differences between successive function spaces. It satisfies the two-scale relation:

$$
\psi(t) = \sqrt{2} \sum_{k} g_k \phi(2t - k)
$$

where \( g_k \) are the wavelet coefficients.

### Decomposition and Reconstruction

MRA involves decomposing a function into its approximations and details at various levels of resolution. This is achieved through the following steps:

1. **Decomposition**: 
   - Approximation coefficients \( c_j \) and detail coefficients \( d_j \) are computed at each level.
   - The function is represented as a sum of approximations and details.

2. **Reconstruction**:
   - The original function is reconstructed by combining the approximation and detail coefficients.

### Orthonormal Wavelets

In MRA, wavelets are often chosen to be orthonormal, ensuring that the function spaces \( V_j \) and detail spaces \( W_j \) are orthogonal. This simplifies the analysis and computation.

## Example: Haar Wavelet and MRA

### Haar Wavelet

The Haar wavelet is the simplest example of a wavelet used in MRA. The scaling function \( \phi(t) \) and wavelet function \( \psi(t) \) are defined as:

$$
\phi(t) = \begin{cases}
1, & 0 \leq t < 1 \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

$$
\psi(t) = \begin{cases}
1, & 0 \leq t < \frac{1}{2} \\
-1, & \frac{1}{2} \leq t < 1 \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

### Multiresolution Decomposition

Consider a signal \( f \) sampled at discrete points. The Haar wavelet transform decomposes the signal into approximations and details:

1. **Compute Approximation and Detail Coefficients**:
   - Approximation: \( a_j = \frac{f_{2j} + f_{2j+1}}{2} \)
   - Detail: \( d_j = \frac{f_{2j} - f_{2j+1}}{2} \)

2. **Recursive Decomposition**: Repeat the process on the approximation coefficients to obtain higher levels of decomposition.

### Pseudocode for Haar Wavelet Transform

```python
import numpy as np

def haar_wavelet_transform(signal):
    n = len(signal)
    output = np.copy(signal)
    length = n
    while length > 1:
        length = length // 2
        for i in range(length):
            output[i] = (signal[2 * i] + signal[2 * i + 1]) / 2
            output[length + i] = (signal[2 * i] - signal[2 * i + 1]) / 2
        signal[:length] = output[:length]
    return output

def haar_wavelet_inverse(transform):
    n = len(transform)
    length = 1
    output = np.copy(transform)
    while length < n:
        for i in range(length):
            output[2 * i] = transform[i] + transform[length + i]
            output[2 * i + 1] = transform[i] - transform[length + i]
        length *= 2
    return output

# Example signal
signal = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8])

# Forward Haar wavelet transform
transformed_signal = haar_wavelet_transform(signal)
print("Transformed Signal:", transformed_signal)

# Inverse Haar wavelet transform
reconstructed_signal = haar_wavelet_inverse(transformed_signal)
print("Reconstructed Signal:", reconstructed_signal)
```

## Applications of MRA

### Signal Processing

MRA is widely used in signal processing for noise reduction, compression, and feature extraction. Wavelet-based methods can efficiently represent signals with localized features and discontinuities.

### Image Processing

In image processing, MRA is used for image compression (e.g., JPEG 2000), denoising, and texture analysis. Wavelets can represent images at multiple resolutions, capturing both coarse and fine details.

### Numerical Analysis

MRA is applied to solve differential equations and integral equations, particularly for problems with localized features or singularities. Wavelet-based methods provide adaptive resolution, improving accuracy and efficiency.

### Data Analysis

MRA is used in data analysis for trend detection, anomaly detection, and multiscale analysis. Wavelets can separate data into components at different scales, revealing hidden patterns.

## Summary

Multiresolution Analysis (MRA) is a powerful framework for analyzing functions at multiple levels of resolution. By decomposing functions into components that capture different scales of detail, MRA enables efficient representation and analysis of signals and functions with localized features. MRA has broad applications in signal processing, image processing, numerical analysis, and data analysis.
