Causal overdetermination

# Causal Overdetermination

[[Causal overdetermination]] occurs when multiple causal factors are present, each of which would be independently sufficient to bring about the same effect. This phenomenon creates significant challenges for theories of causation, counterfactual analysis, and the metaphysics of causal relations.

## Formal Characterization

Causal overdetermination can be formalized as follows:

$$\text{Overdetermined}(e) \iff \exists c_1, c_2 \text{ such that } c_1 \neq c_2 \land \text{Sufficient}(c_1, e) \land \text{Sufficient}(c_2, e)$$

Where:
- $e$ is the effect
- $c_1, c_2$ are distinct causes
- $\text{Sufficient}(c, e)$ means $c$ is causally sufficient for $e$

## Types of Overdetermination

### Symmetrical Overdetermination

In [[symmetrical overdetermination]], multiple causes operate simultaneously and independently:

$$\text{SymmetricalOverdetermination}(e) \iff \exists c_1, c_2 \text{ such that } c_1 \neq c_2 \land \text{Simultaneous}(c_1, c_2) \land \text{IndependentlySufficient}(c_1, e) \land \text{IndependentlySufficient}(c_2, e)$$

Classic example: Two assassins simultaneously shoot a victim, with either shot being fatal.

### Asymmetrical Overdetermination

In [[asymmetrical overdetermination]] or [[preemption]], one cause preempts another potential cause:

$$\text{AsymmetricalOverdetermination}(e) \iff \exists c_1, c_2, t_1, t_2 \text{ such that } c_1 \neq c_2 \land t_1 < t_2 \land \text{Occurs}(c_1, t_1) \land \text{WouldOccur}(c_2, t_2) \land \text{Causes}(c_1, e) \land \text{WouldCause}(c_2, e) \land \text{Prevents}(c_1, c_2)$$

Classic example: Assassin A shoots the victim, who would have been shot by Assassin B moments later had they not already been killed.

## Challenges for Theories of Causation

### Counterfactual Theory Challenges

[[Counterfactual theory]] (Lewis) defines causation in terms of counterfactual dependence:

$$\text{Causes}(c, e) \iff \neg c \, \square\!\rightarrow \, \neg e$$

But in overdetermination cases:

$$\neg c_1 \not\,\square\!\rightarrow \, \neg e \text{ and } \neg c_2 \not\,\square\!\rightarrow \, \neg e$$

Since the effect would still occur due to the other cause.

### INUS Condition Approach

[[INUS condition]] theory (Mackie) defines causes as Insufficient but Necessary parts of Unnecessary but Sufficient conditions:

$$c \text{ is an INUS condition for } e \iff \exists X(c \in X \land \text{Sufficient}(X, e) \land \neg\text{Sufficient}(X - \{c\}, e)) \land \exists Y(Y \neq X \land \text{Sufficient}(Y, e))$$

In overdetermination, each cause fails to be necessary for any sufficient condition.

### Probabilistic Causation Issues

[[Probabilistic causation]] faces problems because overdetermining causes may not raise the probability of the effect:

$$P(e|c_1 \land c_2) = P(e|c_1) = P(e|c_2) = 1$$

## Metaphysical Implications

### Causal Exclusion Problem

The [[causal exclusion problem]] arises in philosophy of mind when mental and physical causes potentially overdetermine effects:

$$\text{Mental}(m) \land \text{Physical}(p) \land \text{Causes}(m, e) \land \text{Causes}(p, e) \land m \neq p \implies \text{Overdetermined}(e)?$$

This creates tension in non-reductive physicalism.

### Causation vs. Determination

Overdetermination highlights the distinction between [[causation]] and [[determination]]:

$$\text{Determines}(c, e) \not\Rightarrow \text{Causes}(c, e)$$

Even if multiple factors determine an outcome, not all may be genuinely causal.

## Proposed Solutions

### Causal Models and Structural Equations

[[Causal models]] using [[structural equations]] can represent overdetermination by:

$$E = C_1 \lor C_2$$

Where $E, C_1, C_2$ are binary variables representing the effect and causes.

### Interventionist Approaches

[[Interventionist theories]] (Woodward) define causation in terms of possible manipulations:

$$\text{Causes}(c, e) \iff \exists \text{intervention } I \text{ on } c \text{ such that } I \text{ changes } e$$

This approach allows distinguishing genuine causes in overdetermination scenarios.

### Process Theories

[[Process theories]] (Salmon, Dowe) define causation in terms of physical processes:

$$\text{Causes}(c, e) \iff \exists p(\text{Process}(p) \land \text{ConnectsCausally}(p, c, e))$$

Both overdetermining causes can maintain causal processes connecting them to the effect.

## Applications Across Domains

### Law and Responsibility

In [[legal theory]], overdetermination raises questions about [[joint liability]]:

$$\text{Liable}(a_1) \land \text{Liable}(a_2) \text{ where both contribute to harm}$$

Solutions include proportional liability or joint and several liability.

### Scientific Explanation

In [[scientific explanation]], overdetermined events may require multiple explanatory frameworks:

$$\text{Explains}_{\text{level 1}}(c_1, e) \land \text{Explains}_{\text{level 2}}(c_2, e)$$

### Medical Causation

In medicine, [[multicausal diseases]] feature overdetermination:

$$\text{Disease}(d) \iff \exists S \subseteq \{f_1, f_2, ..., f_n\} \text{ such that } |S| \geq k \land \text{AllPresent}(S)$$

Where $f_1, f_2, ..., f_n$ are risk factors and $k$ is a threshold.

## Philosophical Subtleties

### Collective vs. Distributive Causation

The distinction between [[collective causation]] and [[distributive causation]]:

$$\text{CollectivelyCause}(\{c_1, c_2\}, e) \not\equiv \text{Causes}(c_1, e) \land \text{Causes}(c_2, e)$$

### Fine-Grained Effects

Distinguishing [[fine-grained effects]] can sometimes resolve apparent overdetermination:

$$e_1 \neq e_2 \text{ where } e_1 = \text{"death by bullet 1"} \text{ and } e_2 = \text{"death by bullet 2"}$$

### Levels of Description

[[Levels of description]] affect whether something appears overdetermined:

$$\text{Causes}_{\text{macro}}(c_{\text{macro}}, e) \land \text{Causes}_{\text{micro}}(c_{\text{micro}}, e) \not\implies \text{Overdetermined}(e)$$

## Research Frontiers

Current research explores:
- Formal methods for representing overdetermination in [[causal Bayesian networks]]
- [[Causal pluralism]] approaches to accommodate overdetermination
- [[Proportional theories]] of causation that quantify causal contribution
- [[Contrastive causal explanation]] in overdetermined contexts
- [[Emergent causation]] and its relation to overdetermination

## Experimental Philosophy

[[Experimental philosophy]] has investigated intuitions about overdetermination:

$$\text{JudgmentOfCausation}(c) = f(\text{Abnormality}, \text{Intention}, \text{Moral Status}, \text{Cultural Background})$$

Showing that causal attribution in overdetermined scenarios is influenced by normative factors.
