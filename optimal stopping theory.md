### Optimal Stopping Theory

**Optimal Stopping Theory** is a branch of mathematics and probability theory that deals with the problem of choosing the best time to take a particular action in order to maximize an expected reward or minimize an expected cost. This decision is made in a sequential setting where observations become available over time, and the decision-maker must decide when to stop based on these observations.

### Key Concepts

1. **Stopping Rule**: A strategy or rule that specifies the conditions under which to stop observing and take a particular action.
2. **Sequential Observation**: Observations or data points that are collected in a sequence over time.
3. **Payoff Function**: A function that assigns a reward or cost to each possible outcome based on the time of stopping.
4. **Expectation**: The goal is usually to maximize the expected payoff, which is the average payoff one would expect over many repetitions of the stopping process.

### Mathematical Framework

Consider a sequence of random variables \( X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n \) representing the observations. The decision-maker can stop at any time \( k \) (where \( 1 \leq k \leq n \)) and receive a payoff \( Y_k \), which is a function of the observation \( X_k \).

The problem is to find a stopping time \( \tau \) that maximizes the expected payoff \( E[Y_\tau] \). Formally, the optimal stopping problem can be stated as:

$$
\tau^* = \arg\max_\tau E[Y_\tau]
$$

where \( \tau \) is a stopping time.

### Example: Secretary Problem

The **Secretary Problem** (also known as the "Marriage Problem") is a classic example of an optimal stopping problem. The goal is to select the best secretary out of \( n \) applicants who are interviewed sequentially.

1. **Rules**:
   - Applicants are interviewed one by one in random order.
   - After each interview, a decision must be made to either accept or reject the applicant.
   - Rejected applicants cannot be recalled.

2. **Objective**:
   - Maximize the probability of selecting the best applicant.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Interview the first \( r \) applicants and reject them all. \( r \) is the largest integer such that \( \frac{r}{n} \approx \frac{1}{e} \) (where \( e \) is the base of the natural logarithm, approximately 2.718).
   - After the first \( r \) applicants, accept the next applicant who is better than all previous applicants.

This strategy gives a probability of approximately \( \frac{1}{e} \) (around 37%) of selecting the best applicant.

### Formulation and Solution

For a general optimal stopping problem, consider:

- A sequence of observed random variables \( X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n \).
- A sequence of payoff functions \( Y_1, Y_2, \ldots, Y_n \).

The goal is to maximize the expected payoff:

$$
V = \max_{1 \leq \tau \leq n} E[Y_\tau]
$$

The solution involves dynamic programming and backward induction:

1. **Define the Value Function**:
   \( V_k \) represents the maximum expected payoff from stopping at or after time \( k \):

   $$
   V_k = \max \left\{ Y_k, E[V_{k+1} \mid X_k] \right\}
   $$

   where \( V_{k+1} \) is the value function at the next time step.

2. **Backward Induction**:
   - Start from the last observation \( X_n \):
     $$
     V_n = Y_n
     $$
   - Move backward to the first observation:
     $$
     V_k = \max \left\{ Y_k, E[V_{k+1} \mid X_k] \right\}
     $$

### Applications

Optimal stopping theory has numerous applications across various fields:

1. **Finance**: 
   - Pricing American options, where the holder can exercise the option at any time before expiration.
   - Real options analysis, where investment decisions are made under uncertainty.

2. **Operations Research**:
   - Inventory management, where decisions on when to reorder are made to minimize costs.
   - Quality control, where inspection processes decide when to stop sampling.

3. **Computer Science**:
   - Online algorithms, where decisions are made sequentially with the goal of optimizing a certain criterion (e.g., caching and paging).

4. **Statistics**:
   - Sequential analysis, where data is analyzed as it is collected, and the decision to stop collecting data is made to achieve a desired confidence level.

### Example: American Option Pricing

An American option allows the holder to exercise the option at any time before expiration. The problem is to determine the optimal time to exercise the option to maximize the payoff.

1. **Payoff Function**: Let \( S_t \) be the stock price at time \( t \), and let \( K \) be the strike price. The payoff function for a call option is \( (S_t - K)^+ \).
2. **Value Function**: Define the value function \( V(t, S_t) \) as the maximum expected payoff from time \( t \) onwards.
3. **Backward Induction**:
   - At expiration \( T \):
     $$
     V(T, S_T) = (S_T - K)^+
     $$
   - At any earlier time \( t \):
     $$
     V(t, S_t) = \max \left\{ (S_t - K)^+, E[V(t+1, S_{t+1}) \mid S_t] \right\}
     $$

   This recursive relationship helps determine the optimal stopping time for exercising the option.

### Conclusion

Optimal stopping theory provides a rigorous framework for making sequential decisions in various fields. By focusing on maximizing the expected payoff or minimizing the expected cost, this theory helps decision-makers determine the best time to take action under uncertainty. Through dynamic programming and backward induction, optimal stopping problems can be solved efficiently, leading to practical applications in finance, operations research, computer science, and beyond.
