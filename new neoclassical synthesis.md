New neoclassical synthesis


**ASSISTANT**

The New Neoclassical Synthesis (NNS) is a modern macroeconomic framework that integrates elements of both New Keynesian and New Classical theories. It aims to provide a more comprehensive understanding of economic fluctuations and policy effects by combining the [[microfoundations]] of New Classical economics with the market imperfections and price rigidities emphasized by New Keynesian economics. 

### Key Components

1. **Microfoundations and Rational Expectations**: 
   The NNS retains the New Classical emphasis on rigorous [[microfoundations]] and rational expectations. This means that individual agents (households and firms) are modeled as optimizing behavior based on their expectations about the future, which are assumed to be rational.

2. **Sticky Prices and Wages**: 
   From New Keynesian economics, the NNS incorporates the concept of price and wage stickiness. These rigidities imply that prices and wages do not adjust instantaneously to changes in economic conditions, leading to short-run non-neutralities of money and real effects of monetary policy.

3. **Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) Models**: 
   The NNS is often operationalized through DSGE models. These models are used to describe the economy as a system of equations derived from microeconomic principles, incorporating stochastic processes to account for random shocks.

4. **Monetary Policy Rules**: 
   The framework emphasizes the role of systematic monetary policy rules, such as the Taylor Rule, which prescribes how central banks should adjust nominal interest rates in response to deviations of inflation from its target and output from its natural level.

5. **Real Business Cycle (RBC) Theory**: 
   The NNS also integrates elements of RBC theory, particularly the idea that economic fluctuations can be driven by real (as opposed to nominal) shocks, such as changes in technology or productivity.

### Mathematical Formalism

Consider a basic NNS model incorporating a representative agent framework:

- **Household Optimization**:
  Households maximize expected lifetime utility:
  $$ 
  \max \mathbb{E}_t \left[ \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \beta^t U(C_t, L_t) \right] 
  $$
  subject to the budget constraint:
  $$ 
  P_t C_t + B_{t+1} \leq W_t L_t + (1 + r_t) B_t + \Pi_t 
  $$
  where $C_t$ is consumption, $L_t$ is labor, $P_t$ is the price level, $B_t$ is bonds, $W_t$ is the wage rate, $r_t$ is the interest rate, $\Pi_t$ are profits from firms, and $\beta$ is the discount factor.

- **Firm Optimization**:
  Firms maximize profits subject to a production function:
  $$ 
  Y_t = A_t F(K_t, L_t) 
  $$
  and face nominal rigidities, often modeled using Calvo pricing:
  $$ 
  P_t(i) = \begin{cases} 
  \bar{P}_t & \text{with probability } (1-\theta) \\
  P_{t-1}(i) & \text{with probability } \theta 
  \end{cases}
  $$
  where $A_t$ is a technology shock, $K_t$ is capital, $Y_t$ is output, and $\theta$ represents the fraction of firms that cannot adjust prices in a given period.

- **Monetary Policy Rule**:
  Central banks follow a rule such as the Taylor Rule:
  $$ 
  r_t = r^* + \phi_{\pi} (\pi_t - \pi^*) + \phi_y (y_t - y^*) 
  $$
  where $r^*$ is the equilibrium real interest rate, $\pi_t$ is the inflation rate, $\pi^*$ is the target inflation rate, $y_t$ is the output, $y^*$ is the potential output, and $\phi_{\pi}$, $\phi_y$ are policy response coefficients.

### Implications and Applications

The NNS framework has been widely used for analyzing monetary policy and understanding business cycles. It provides a coherent structure to study how various shocks propagate through the economy and how policy interventions can stabilize economic fluctuations. Notably, the [[Great Recession]] and subsequent policy responses have been studied extensively within this framework.

By integrating the microeconomic rigor of New Classical economics with the real-world frictions highlighted by New Keynesian economics, the NNS offers a robust platform for both theoretical exploration and practical policy analysis.
