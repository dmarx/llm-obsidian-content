assurance contract


**ASSISTANT**

An assurance contract is a mechanism in game theory and economics designed to facilitate the provision of [[public goods]] through voluntary contributions. It addresses the problem of free-riding in [[public goods]] provision by ensuring that contributions are only collected if a specified threshold of total contributions is met. If the threshold is not met, contributions are refunded to the participants. This mechanism creates an incentive for individuals to contribute, as they are assured that their contribution will only be collected if it results in the public good being provided.

### Mechanism and Structure

An assurance contract typically involves the following steps:

1. **Proposal**: A proposer (could be an individual or an organization) initiates the contract, specifying the public good to be provided and the threshold amount of total contributions needed.
2. **Commitment Phase**: Potential contributors pledge a certain amount of money to the project.
3. **Threshold Evaluation**: Once the commitment phase ends, the total contributions are evaluated against the specified threshold.
4. **Execution or Refund**:
   - If the total contributions meet or exceed the threshold, the public good is provided, and the contributions are collected.
   - If the threshold is not met, the contributions are refunded to the contributors.

### Mathematical Formalization

Let $N$ be the number of potential contributors. Each contributor $i$ pledges an amount $c_i$. Let $C$ denote the total contributions:

$$
C = \sum_{i=1}^{N} c_i
$$

Define $T$ as the threshold amount needed for the public good to be provided. The assurance contract ensures that:

- If $C \geq T$, the contributions are collected, and the public good is provided.
- If $C < T$, the contributions are refunded.

### Utility Considerations

The utility for each contributor $i$ can be modeled based on whether the public good is provided or not. Let $U_i^{\text{provide}}$ and $U_i^{\text{no provide}}$ represent the utility of contributor $i$ if the public good is provided and not provided, respectively. The utility function can incorporate the following elements:

- \( B_i \): The benefit derived by contributor $i$ from the public good.
- \( c_i \): The contribution made by contributor $i$.

The utility can be expressed as:

- If the public good is provided: \( U_i^{\text{provide}} = B_i - c_i \)
- If the public good is not provided: \( U_i^{\text{no provide}} = 0 \)

### Assurance Contract with a Refund Bonus

To further incentivize contributions, assurance contracts can include a refund bonus. If the public good is not provided, contributors receive more than their initial contribution back, mitigating the risk of contributing. Let \( r_i \) be the refund bonus for contributor $i$. The modified utility function in case the public good is not provided becomes:

$$
U_i^{\text{no provide}} = c_i + r_i
$$

### Example

Consider a public good requiring a threshold of $T = \$1000$. There are 10 potential contributors, each able to contribute up to \$200. The contributions and the refund bonus scheme are as follows:

1. Each contributor pledges \$100.
2. The total pledged amount is $C = 10 \times \$100 = \$1000$.
3. Since $C \geq T$, the public good is provided, and each contributor's utility is \( U_i^{\text{provide}} = B_i - \$100 \).

If the total contributions were only \$800, each contributor would receive their \$100 back, possibly with a small bonus \( r_i \) to incentivize future participation, such as \$10, resulting in \( U_i^{\text{no provide}} = \$100 + \$10 = \$110 \).

### Related Concepts

Assurance contracts are closely related to concepts such as:

- **[[Public Goods]]**: Goods that are non-excludable and non-rivalrous, leading to free-rider problems.
- **[[Mechanism Design]]**: A field in economics and game theory that designs economic mechanisms or incentives to achieve desired objectives.
- **[[Crowdfunding]]**: A practical application of assurance contracts, where projects are funded through small contributions from many individuals.

### Conclusion

Assurance contracts provide a structured approach to overcoming the free-rider problem in the provision of [[public goods]]. By ensuring that contributions are only collected if a threshold is met, they create a secure environment for potential contributors, encouraging participation and facilitating the successful provision of [[public goods]].
