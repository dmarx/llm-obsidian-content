Kahn–Kalai conjecture


**ASSISTANT**

The Kahn–Kalai conjecture is a notable open problem in the field of probabilistic combinatorics, specifically in the context of thresholds for increasing properties in random structures. This conjecture, proposed by [[Jeff Kahn]] and [[Gil Kalai]], addresses the critical point at which a random discrete structure almost surely possesses a particular property.

## Conjecture Statement

Consider a finite set $X$ and a monotone increasing family of subsets of $X$, denoted by $\mathcal{F} \subseteq 2^X$. For each $p \in [0,1]$, let $\mathbb{P}_p$ denote the probability measure on $2^X$ where each element of $X$ is included independently with probability $p$. The threshold probability $p_c(\mathcal{F})$ is defined as the value of $p$ for which $\mathbb{P}_p(\mathcal{F}) = 1/2$. 

The Kahn–Kalai conjecture posits that if $\mathcal{F}$ is an increasing family of subsets with a threshold at $p_c(\mathcal{F})$, then there exists a certain robust control over the expected number of "small" sets within $\mathcal{F}$ that are near the threshold. More formally, the conjecture suggests that the threshold $p_c(\mathcal{F})$ is not overly sensitive to small perturbations, meaning that it can be bounded in terms of the expectation of the measure of small subsets.

## Formalization

To provide a formal statement, we use the following notation:
- $|X| = n$ is the size of the ground set.
- $\mathcal{F} \subseteq 2^X$ is a monotone increasing family, meaning if $A \in \mathcal{F}$ and $A \subseteq B \subseteq X$, then $B \in $\mathcal{F}$.

### Expectation and Threshold

Define $\mathcal{F}_k$ as the collection of sets in $\mathcal{F}$ of size at most $k$:
$$\mathcal{F}_k = \{A \in \mathcal{F} : |A| \leq k\}.$$

Let $\mu_p(\mathcal{F})$ denote the expected size of $\mathcal{F}$ under the measure $\mathbb{P}_p$:
$$\mu_p(\mathcal{F}) = \mathbb{E}_p[|\mathcal{F}|] = \sum_{A \in \mathcal{F}} \mathbb{P}_p(A).$$

### Kahn–Kalai Conjecture

The conjecture can be stated as follows:
For every increasing family $\mathcal{F} \subseteq 2^X$, there exists a constant $C > 0$ such that for any $p \in [0,1]$,
$$p_c(\mathcal{F}) \leq C \cdot \sup_{k \leq Cn} \frac{\log \left(\frac{1}{\mathbb{P}_p(\mathcal{F}_k)}\right)}{k}.$$

Here, $\mathbb{P}_p(\mathcal{F}_k)$ denotes the probability that a randomly chosen subset of $X$ (under measure $\mathbb{P}_p$) is in $\mathcal{F}_k$.

## Implications and Related Results

The Kahn–Kalai conjecture has deep implications for the theory of random structures and phase transitions. It suggests that the location of the threshold for any increasing property can be effectively estimated by considering the probability of small subsets achieving the property. 

This conjecture is related to the concept of sharp thresholds and the study of influences in Boolean functions. For example, it connects to the concept of the sharp threshold theorem by Friedgut and the concept of influences in the study of Boolean functions, which are critical tools in understanding the behavior of thresholds in random structures.

Understanding the Kahn–Kalai conjecture would significantly advance the field of probabilistic combinatorics by providing a more comprehensive framework for analyzing thresholds in random structures.

Further explorations and proofs related to this conjecture might involve advanced probabilistic methods and combinatorial arguments. For a deeper dive, one might explore connections with concepts such as the [[Friedgut’s Sharp Threshold Theorem]], [[BKKKL Theorem]], and various applications in [[random graph theory]] and [[percolation theory]].
