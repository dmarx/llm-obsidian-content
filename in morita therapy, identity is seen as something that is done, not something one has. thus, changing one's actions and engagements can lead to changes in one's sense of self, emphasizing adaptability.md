> In Morita therapy, identity is seen as something that is done, not something one has. Thus, changing one's actions and engagements can lead to changes in one's sense of self, emphasizing adaptability and responsiveness to the environment.


**ASSISTANT**

Shoma Morita's view of identity as a dynamic and actionable concept, rather than a static possession, significantly shifts how we think about selfhood and personal development. This perspective aligns with his broader philosophical teachings and the principles of Morita therapy, which emphasize adaptability, engagement, and the importance of action in shaping one’s sense of self.

### Key Features of Morita's View on Identity

#### 1. **Identity as Action-Oriented**
Morita therapy proposes that identity is constructed through actions and engagements with the world, rather than being an inherent attribute or a fixed trait that one possesses. According to this view, our actions and choices play a critical role in defining who we are. This approach shifts the focus from an internal search for a pre-defined identity to an external expression of self through behavior and interaction.

#### 2. **Responsiveness to Environment**
In Morita's framework, identity is closely tied to one's environment and the specific contexts in which an individual operates. By responding adaptively to changing circumstances and engaging meaningfully with our surroundings, we actively shape our identity. This responsiveness emphasizes the situational and contingent nature of selfhood, suggesting that our identities can evolve as our environments and interactions change.

#### 3. **Adaptability and Fluidity**
Morita therapy values adaptability and fluidity in identity. Just as emotional states are acknowledged and accepted without undue attachment, identity is also seen as something that can and should change in response to life’s dynamics. This fluid approach to identity encourages individuals to remain open to growth and transformation, viewing changes in self-perception not as threats but as natural adaptations to life’s challenges and opportunities.

#### 4. **Therapeutic Implications of Action**
By conceptualizing identity as something done rather than had, Morita therapy provides a therapeutic path that focuses on taking action. Patients are encouraged to engage in activities that align with their values, even when their emotional state might not feel conducive to action. This emphasis on doing helps patients overcome paralysis by analysis or excessive introspection, which can exacerbate feelings of anxiety or depression.

### Philosophical and Practical Implications

#### **Philosophical Relevance**
Morita's view challenges Western notions of a core, unchanging self. It introduces a philosophy where identity is seen as emergent and transactional, constantly being recreated through interactions and activities. This perspective can be liberating, as it allows for a more flexible approach to self-development and personal change.

#### **Practical Applications in Psychotherapy**
In practical terms, focusing on actions rather than on introspective identification with internal states can lead to more effective coping strategies in psychotherapy. Patients learn to act their way into new ways of thinking rather than thinking their way into new ways of acting, which can be particularly beneficial for those struggling with mood disorders and anxiety.

#### **Cultural and Social Considerations**
This view of identity as dynamic and responsive may resonate particularly well in cultures that emphasize community, adaptability, and the interdependent nature of selfhood, although it also has universal applications in the increasingly globalized and interconnected world.

### Conclusion

Shoma Morita’s conceptualization of identity as something that is done rather than possessed offers a profound shift in understanding the nature of self. This approach not only enriches the therapeutic process by encouraging action and engagement but also provides a broader philosophical framework for considering how we come to define and understand ourselves in an ever-changing world.
