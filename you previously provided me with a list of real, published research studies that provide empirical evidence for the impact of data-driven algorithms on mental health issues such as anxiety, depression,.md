**USER**

you previously provided me with a list of real, published research studies that provide empirical evidence for the impact of data-driven algorithms on mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, and suicidality, particularly among adolescents and young adults. That's an interesting affected population, but it's not the only harmed population we've discussed. Please also suggest relevant citations discussing addictive behaviors, whales, and associated harms that are relevant to the issue we are discussing


**ASSISTANT**

The issue of digital addiction, particularly as it pertains to "whale" users who spend disproportionate amounts of time and money on digital platforms, involves complex interactions between technology design, user behavior, and psychological impacts. Below are several scholarly articles and studies that explore these aspects, providing empirical evidence on addictive behaviors, economic exploitation, and their associated harms:

### 1. **Addictive Behaviors and Digital Platforms**
- **Turel, O., & Qahri-Saremi, H. (2016).** Problematic Use of Social Networking Sites: Antecedents and Consequence from a Dual-System Theory Perspective. _Journal of Management Information Systems_, 33(4), 1087-1116.
   - This study applies a [[dual-system theory]] to examine how cognitive and affective processes contribute to problematic social media use, which can become addictive and lead to significant social and psychological harms.

### 2. **Economic Exploitation of High-Engagement Users (Whales)**
- **King, D. L., Delfabbro, P. H., & Griffiths, M. D. (2010).** The convergence of gambling and digital media: Implications for gambling in young people. _Journal of Gambling Studies_, 26(2), 175-187.
   - This article discusses how features common to both gambling and digital game design can lead to high engagement and spending, particularly focusing on mechanisms that exploit psychological vulnerabilities.

### 3. **Psychological Impacts of High Engagement**
- **Andreassen, C. S. (2015).** Online Social Network Site Addiction: A Comprehensive Review. _Current Addiction Reports_, 2(2), 175-184.
   - This review provides a comprehensive look at addiction to social networking sites, including the psychological traits that predispose individuals to become "whales," and the mental health outcomes associated with this addictive behavior.

### 4. **Behavioral Economics and User Manipulation**
- **Sch√ºll, N. D. (2014).** Addiction by Design: Machine Gambling in Las Vegas. Princeton University Press.
   - Although focused on gambling, this book provides valuable insights into how digital interfaces can be designed to encourage continuous use and risk-taking, relevant for understanding similar designs in digital platforms.

### 5. **Regulatory Perspectives on Addictive Digital Behaviors**
- **Gainsbury, S. M., & Wood, R. (2011).** Internet Gambling Policy in Critical Comparative Perspective: The Effectiveness of Existing Regulatory Frameworks. _International Gambling Studies_, 11(3), 309-323.
   - This study explores regulatory responses to internet gambling, a field with significant parallels to digital platform regulation, especially concerning the protection of high-engagement users.

### 6. **Impact on Specific Populations like Adolescents**
- **Mihara, S., & Higuchi, S. (2017).** Cross-sectional and longitudinal epidemiological studies of internet gaming disorder: A systematic review of the literature. _Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences_, 71(7), 425-444.
   - This review analyzes studies on Internet Gaming Disorder, providing data on prevalence, risk factors, and psychosocial outcomes, particularly in adolescents and young adults who might be considered whales in the gaming context.

### Conclusion
These studies collectively underline the breadth and depth of the issues associated with digital addiction, especially concerning high-engagement "whale" users. They highlight the psychological, social, and economic dimensions of the problem and provide a strong empirical basis for advocating regulatory interventions. The research not only informs our understanding of these phenomena but also supports the development of policies designed to mitigate harm and protect vulnerable populations in the digital ecosystem.
