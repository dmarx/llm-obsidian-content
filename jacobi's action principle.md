Jacobi's action principle


**ASSISTANT**

**Jacobi's Action Principle** is a formulation of the dynamics of a mechanical system that is particularly well-suited for **relational mechanics**, where absolute notions of time and space are avoided. It is a **reparametrization-invariant** principle, meaning that it does not rely on an external time parameter, and instead focuses on the *geodesic* (shortest or extremal path) in the system's configuration space. This principle is an alternative to the usual Lagrangian or Hamiltonian formulations that depend explicitly on time.

### Key Ideas in Jacobi's Action Principle

1. **Configuration Space**:
   - Consider a system of \( N \) particles, where each particle \( i \) has a position vector \( \mathbf{q}_i \). The total system is described by a point in **configuration space**, which is the \( 3N \)-dimensional space of all possible positions of the particles.
   
   - The system's evolution can be described by a path in this configuration space. Instead of using time as the parameter for this path, Jacobi's principle finds the trajectory that extremizes an action that depends only on the system's kinetic and potential energy.

2. **Reparametrization Invariance**:
   - Jacobi’s principle removes the explicit time dependence by reparametrizing the system’s evolution. The idea is that we are only concerned with the shape of the trajectory in configuration space, not the rate at which the system moves along that trajectory.
   
   - Thus, the parameter along the trajectory is arbitrary, and the principle focuses on finding the "extremal path" without reference to how quickly the system moves along this path.

3. **Jacobi's Action**:
   - The usual **action** in classical mechanics is the time integral of the Lagrangian \( L = T - V \), where \( T \) is the kinetic energy and \( V \) is the potential energy. In Jacobi’s principle, time is eliminated, and the action depends on an integral that combines both the kinetic and potential energies.

   - The **Jacobi action** \( S_J \) is given by:
   $$
   S_J = \int \sqrt{E - V(\mathbf{q})} \, ds
   $$
   where:
   - \( E \) is the total energy of the system (a conserved quantity).
   - \( V(\mathbf{q}) \) is the potential energy as a function of the configuration \( \mathbf{q} \).
   - \( ds = \sqrt{g_{ij} \, dq^i \, dq^j} \) is the **infinitesimal arc length** in configuration space, with \( g_{ij} \) being the metric tensor of the configuration space (in Euclidean space, this is simply the sum of the squared displacements of the particles).

   The key point is that this action is **parametrization-invariant** because there is no reference to a specific time parameter, just the path in configuration space.

### Mathematical Formulation

1. **Kinetic Energy**:
   - The **kinetic energy** \( T \) of the system is given by:
   $$
   T = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \dot{\mathbf{q}}_i^2
   $$
   where \( m_i \) is the mass of particle \( i \), and \( \dot{\mathbf{q}}_i \) is its velocity.

   - However, since Jacobi’s principle eliminates time, we replace the velocities \( \dot{\mathbf{q}}_i \) with the **arc length element** \( ds \), which parametrizes the path in configuration space.

2. **Action Functional**:
   - The action \( S_J \) in Jacobi’s principle is written as:
   $$
   S_J = \int \sqrt{2(E - V(\mathbf{q}))} \, ds
   $$
   where \( ds \) is the **line element** in configuration space.

   - Here, \( E \) is the total energy (a constant) of the system, and \( V(\mathbf{q}) \) is the potential energy at configuration \( \mathbf{q} \).

3. **Principle of Least Action**:
   - Jacobi’s principle is a **variational principle**, meaning that the physical path taken by the system is the one that extremizes the action \( S_J \). This leads to an equation of motion similar to the Euler-Lagrange equations in classical mechanics but without explicit reference to time.

4. **Geodesic Interpretation**:
   - The trajectory of the system in configuration space corresponds to a **geodesic** (extremal path) in a "kinetic energy landscape," where the kinetic energy is modified by the potential energy. In a sense, the system is "moving" in a space whose geometry is determined by both kinetic and potential energies.

   - Mathematically, this means the system's evolution is governed by the geodesic equation in a configuration space whose metric is influenced by the potential energy function \( V(\mathbf{q}) \).

### Geometrical Interpretation

Jacobi’s principle can be interpreted geometrically as finding the **shortest path** in a curved space. This space is the system’s configuration space, and its geometry is shaped by the potential energy of the system. When the potential energy \( V(\mathbf{q}) \) changes, the effective geometry through which the system moves is altered.

This makes Jacobi’s principle particularly well-suited to **relational mechanics**, where absolute time and space are not fundamental. Instead, the physical motion of the system is described by its path through this geometrical space, independent of how the system "moves" in time.

### Relationship with Classical Mechanics

While Jacobi’s principle is formally different from the standard Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations of mechanics, it is completely equivalent to them. The differences lie in the treatment of time:

- In **Lagrangian mechanics**, the equations of motion are derived by extremizing the action with respect to time, using the Lagrangian \( L = T - V \) as the key function.
- In **Hamiltonian mechanics**, the evolution of the system is described in terms of generalized coordinates and momenta, with explicit reference to time.
- In **Jacobi’s principle**, time is no longer an independent variable. Instead, the action is extremized over the path in configuration space, with no explicit reference to time.

This makes Jacobi’s principle particularly useful in **reparametrization-invariant theories**, such as general relativity, where time is not an absolute background but part of the system’s dynamics.

### Applications of Jacobi's Principle

1. **Relational Mechanics**:
   - **Relational mechanics**—inspired by [[Leibnizian Relationalism]]—avoids absolute notions of space and time. Jacobi’s action principle fits well within this framework because it formulates the dynamics of the system purely in terms of the relative configurations of objects, without referring to an absolute time or external spacetime.
   
   - In such a theory, the motion of the system is determined by the relational distances and angles between particles, and time is understood only as a derived concept based on the system’s evolution.

2. **General Relativity**:
   - In **general relativity**, spacetime is a dynamical entity that is shaped by the distribution of matter and energy. Jacobi’s principle is analogous to the **geodesic principle** in general relativity, where the motion of particles follows the shortest path (geodesic) in curved spacetime. Similarly, in Jacobi’s framework, the system follows a geodesic in the configuration space shaped by the energy of the system.

3. **Quantum Mechanics**:
   - Jacobi’s principle also finds applications in the **quantum realm**, particularly in **quantum gravity** and attempts to formulate a **reparametrization-invariant** theory of quantum mechanics. Since Jacobi’s principle eliminates the need for an external time parameter, it provides a natural framework for theories where time is treated as an emergent or relational concept rather than a fundamental quantity.

### Conclusion

**Jacobi's Action Principle** offers a profound rethinking of classical mechanics by eliminating the explicit role of time and focusing purely on the configuration space and its geometry. It is a natural fit for **relational mechanics** and plays a foundational role in modern theories where time is not a fundamental backdrop but emerges from the system's dynamics. Jacobi’s principle can be extended to quantum theories, general relativity, and even quantum gravity, making it a versatile tool for understanding the dynamics of systems without presupposing absolute notions of space and time.
