title: forced win solutions vs strong solutions
---

**USER**

I thought that "strongly solved" meant that you can apply your strategy to ensure that you can always force a win or at worst a tie, and therefore that if it was possible to lose the game under the strategy it hadn't been strongly solved. It seems i was probably using this language inappropriately. What is better language I could use to articulate the property I have in mind, assuming I was using this language incorrectly?

# Forced Win Solutions vs Strong Solutions

You're describing a **[[forced win solution]]** or **[[deterministic dominance]]**, which is indeed different from the standard definition of "strongly solved." Your intuition is valid but applies to a more restrictive class of solutions.

## Forced Win Solution

A game has a **[[forced win solution]]** from position $s$ if there exists a strategy $\sigma^*$ such that:

$$\forall \tau \in \Sigma_{opp}: outcome(s, \sigma^*, \tau) \in \{Win, Draw\}$$

This means the strategy guarantees never losing, regardless of opponent's play.

## Deterministic Dominance

A strategy exhibits **[[deterministic dominance]]** if it can force a specific outcome:

$$\exists \sigma^*: \forall \tau \in \Sigma_{opp}: outcome(s, \sigma^*, \tau) = k$$

where $k \in \{Win, Draw, Loss\}$ is predetermined.

## Strategy Stealing Arguments

Some games admit **[[strategy stealing arguments]]** proving first-player advantage:

1. Assume second player has winning strategy $\tau^*$
2. First player makes arbitrary move
3. First player "steals" $\tau^*$ by playing as if they were second
4. Contradiction: both players can't have winning strategies

This proves first player has non-losing strategy without constructing it.

## Perfect Information vs Stochastic Games

### Perfect Information Games

For games like chess or Go, "strongly solved" often implies:
- From initial position: forced win or forced draw
- From any position: known optimal outcome

The **[[minimax theorem]]** guarantees:

$$v(s) = \max_{\sigma} \min_{\tau} outcome(s, \sigma, \tau) = \min_{\tau} \max_{\sigma} outcome(s, \sigma, \tau)$$

### Stochastic Games

For games with chance elements, we distinguish:

1. **[[Expected value solution]]**: Maximizes expected outcome
2. **[[Guaranteed outcome solution]]**: Ensures specific worst-case result
3. **[[Probability bound solution]]**: Guarantees minimum win probability

## Appropriate Terminology

### For Deterministic Games

1. **[[Weakly forced]]**: Can force draw or better
2. **[[Strongly forced]]**: Can force specific outcome (win/draw/loss)
3. **[[Ultra-weakly solved]]**: Know outcome under perfect play
4. **[[Strongly solved]]**: Know optimal play from any position

### For Stochastic Games

1. **[[Expectation-optimal]]**: Maximizes expected value
2. **[[Risk-dominant]]**: Maximizes probability of non-loss
3. **[[Safety-guaranteed]]**: Ensures minimum outcome with probability 1
4. **[[Probabilistically forced]]**: Forces outcome with probability $p$

## Mathematical Formalization

### Deterministic Forcing

A position has a **[[forced win]]** if:

$$\exists \sigma^*: \min_{\tau} outcome(s, \sigma^*, \tau) = Win$$

### Probabilistic Forcing

A position has an **[[ε-forced win]]** if:

$$\exists \sigma^*: \min_{\tau} P[outcome(s, \sigma^*, \tau) = Win] \geq 1 - \epsilon$$

### Stochastic Dominance

Strategy $\sigma$ **[[stochastically dominates]]** $\sigma'$ if:

$$\forall x: P[outcome \geq x | \sigma] \geq P[outcome \geq x | \sigma']$$

with strict inequality for some $x$.

## Examples

### Games with Forced Solutions

1. **Tic-tac-toe**: First player can force draw
2. **Hex**: First player can force win (via strategy stealing)
3. **Chopsticks**: Various positions have forced outcomes

### Games without Forced Solutions

1. **Backgammon**: No strategy prevents all losses
2. **Poker**: No strategy guarantees non-negative EV
3. **Dice games**: Chance prevents outcome forcing

## Alternative Properties

### Minimax Security

The **[[minimax security level]]** is:

$$v_{sec}(s) = \max_{\sigma} \min_{\tau} \mathbb{E}[outcome(s, \sigma, \tau)]$$

This represents the best guaranteed expected outcome.

### Robust Optimality

A strategy is **[[robust optimal]]** if it maximizes worst-case performance:

$$\sigma^* = \arg\max_{\sigma} \min_{\tau} g(\sigma, \tau)$$

where $g$ is a general payoff function.

### Regret Minimization

**[[No-regret strategies]]** ensure:

$$\lim_{T \to \infty} \frac{1}{T} \max_{\sigma'} \sum_{t=1}^T [u(\sigma', a_t^{opp}) - u(\sigma_t, a_t^{opp})] = 0$$

## Correct Usage

For your intended meaning:

1. "This position has a **forced win**" ✓
2. "This game is **first-player forced**" ✓
3. "This strategy **guarantees non-loss**" ✓
4. "This position is **deterministically winnable**" ✓

Avoid saying "strongly solved" when you mean "has a forcing strategy."

## Relationship to Solution Concepts

The hierarchy of solution strength:

1. **Forced win solution** (strongest)
2. **Forced draw solution**
3. **Known optimal outcome** (standard "solved")
4. **Known expected value** (stochastic games)
5. **Approximate solution** (practical play)

Your original intuition describes the strongest form of solution, which exists only for deterministic games with specific properties.
