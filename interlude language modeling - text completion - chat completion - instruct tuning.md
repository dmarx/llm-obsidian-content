and then summarize them, providing a concise version of the retrieved content.
3. **Feedback Loops**: Allow the user to provide feedback on the retrieved information, enabling the agent to refine or adjust its search query and generation process.

---

### **Learning Outcomes**:

1. **Hybrid Models**: Students will learn how to integrate retrieval-based systems with generative models, combining structured information retrieval with language generation.
   
2. **Contextual Responses**: The RAG pattern teaches students how to use retrieved data to provide more accurate, context-aware answers, especially for fact-based tasks.
   
3. **API Integration**: The assignment introduces students to the concept of integrating external APIs into agent workflows, making agents more adaptable to real-world tasks where external knowledge is needed.

4. **Real-World Applications**: By implementing retrieval-augmented generation, students gain insight into how cutting-edge AI systems (e.g., search-enhanced chatbots, intelligent assistants) work.

### **Assignment Extension Ideas**:

1. **Dynamic Query Reformulation**: Implement an agent that can refine or reformulate its queries based on the initial results, allowing for more accurate or in-depth retrieval of information.
   
2. **Real-Time Updates**: Create a real-time retrieval system where the agent continuously updates its responses as new information becomes available from external sources (e.g., news or stock market data).
   
3. **Interactive Information Retrieval**: Allow the user to select which pieces of retrieved information should be used for the final generated response, enabling a more interactive RAG process.

---

### **Summary**:

In this assignment, students implement the **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pattern, where an agent retrieves relevant information from an external source and uses it to generate an informed, context-aware response. This pattern combines the strengths of both retrieval and generation, leading to more accurate, relevant, and grounded responses in tasks requiring external knowledge. Through this assignment, students will learn how to build hybrid AI systems capable of handling complex, fact-based queries and adapting to real-world data sources.

### Interlude: The Evolution of Language Models — From Text Completion to Instruction Tuning

In this interlude, we explore the progression of language modeling techniques, starting from **basic language models** for **text completion**, evolving to more interactive forms such as **chat completions**, and culminating in the more refined and practical use of **instruction tuning**. This journey reflects how language models have grown from simple text generation to complex, context-aware systems that respond to detailed instructions and perform specific tasks.

---

### **1. Language Modeling: The Foundation**

#### **What is a Language Model?**
A **language model** is a probabilistic model that predicts the likelihood of a sequence of words in a given language. Its main goal is to estimate the probability distribution of word sequences based on previous words, often represented as:

$$
P(w_1, w_2, \dots, w_n) = P(w_1) \cdot P(w_2 | w_1) \cdot P(w_3 | w_1, w_2) \cdot \dots \cdot P(w_n | w_1, \dots, w_{n-1})
$$

**Basic language models**, such as **n-gram models**, were initially used to predict the next word in a sequence based on the preceding words. These models were the foundation of early text completion systems.

#### **Applications**:
- **Predictive Text**: Used in mobile keyboards and search engines, where the model suggests or completes words based on the current input.
- **Autocompletion in IDEs**: Predicts the next word or phrase when writing code or documents.

However, basic language models were limited by their reliance on local context and short-range dependencies.

---

### **2. Text Completion: Transformer-Based Language Models**

The introduction of **Transformer-based models** like **GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer)** revolutionized the ability of language models to generate coherent text over longer sequences by attending to **all words in a sequence** using the attention mechanism. This allowed for more sophisticated **text completion**, where the model could generate longer, more coherent continuations of a text input.

#### **Text Completion in GPT Models**:
- **Autoregressive Generation**: GPT models are trained to predict the next token in a sequence, given all the previous tokens. For example, given a prompt, the model generates text one word at a time:
  
  **Example**:
  ```python
  prompt = "The capital of France is"
  completion = model.generate(prompt)
  # Output: "The capital of France is Paris."
  ```

- **Context-Aware Completion**: Since Transformer-based models can attend to long-range dependencies, they can generate text that remains coherent over longer contexts, unlike n-gram models that rely on a fixed window of previous words.

#### **Applications**:
- **Text Autocompletion**: Systems like Google’s **Smart Compose** use Transformer-based models to autocomplete sentences based on the context of an email or document.
- **Creative Writing**: Tools like **GPT-3** can generate stories, poems, and essays based on a short prompt, making it a useful tool for creative endeavors.

### **3. Chat Completion: Interactive Language Models**

As language models improved, they evolved into systems capable of **dialogue generation**, giving rise to **chat-based models**. These models are designed to maintain coherent and context-aware conversations over multiple turns. Instead of generating a static piece of text, chat models **track the state** of a conversation and adapt their responses accordingly.

#### **Chat-Based Language Models**:
- **Chat Completion**: Chat models such as **GPT-3.5 Turbo** and **GPT-4** are trained not just on static text but also on dialogue data, enabling them to handle back-and-forth interactions with users. These models operate in a chat-style format, where user input is followed by a model response in successive turns.

- **Role Awareness**: Chat models understand different conversational roles (e.g., system, user, assistant), allowing them to structure responses based on who they are interacting with. The inclusion of **role-specific prompts** (e.g., system instructions) guides the assistant's behavior.

  **Example**:
  ```python
  messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of France?"}
  ]
  response = model.chat_completion(messages)
  # Output: "The capital of France is Paris."
  ```

- **Multi-Turn Dialogue**: These models can maintain consistency over multiple interactions, responding to follow-up questions while keeping track of the conversation history.

#### **Applications**:
- **Customer Support**: Chatbots powered by GPT-like models can handle customer queries by following a conversation flow.
- **Personal Assistants**: Virtual assistants like **Siri** or **Google Assistant** can engage in contextually aware conversations with users over multiple turns, retrieving information, or executing commands.

### **4. Instruction Tuning: Fine-Tuning Models for Task Completion**

While chat completion allows for interactive conversations, **instruction tuning** enhances a model's ability to follow complex, structured tasks. In instruction-tuned models, the model is trained or fine-tuned on datasets where each example includes a **clear instruction** and a corresponding output. The goal is to make the model **better at following explicit instructions** for task completion.

#### **What is Instruction Tuning?**
**Instruction tuning** is the process of refining a language model so that it can perform tasks by understanding and adhering to **natural language instructions**. Models like **InstructGPT** are specifically trained on tasks where the input is a natural language instruction, making them more reliable for task-based completion.

- **Training Process**: The model is fine-tuned on task-specific data, where each task has clear instructions (e.g., "Translate this sentence", "Summarize this paragraph", "Solve this math problem"). The model is optimized to follow these instructions and produce accurate outputs.

  **Example**:
  ```python
  prompt = "Summarize the following paragraph: ..."
  response = model.generate(prompt)
  # Output: "The paragraph discusses ..."
  ```

- **Improved Task-Specific Performance**: Compared to general-purpose text generation, instruction-tuned models are better at **following explicit directions**, performing more reliably across tasks like summarization, translation, answering questions, and more.

#### **Applications**:
- **Document Summarization**: Instruction-tuned models can summarize documents by following instructions like "Summarize this report in 100 words."
- **Coding Assistance**: Instruct-tuned models can follow prompts such as "Write a Python function to reverse a string" and generate task-specific code.
- **Task Automation**: Virtual assistants powered by instruction-tuned models can perform specific tasks like sending emails, scheduling appointments, or retrieving data from a database based on detailed user instructions.

### **5. Integration of Techniques**

While these techniques evolved from one another, many modern systems **integrate all three approaches**:
- **Text completion** ensures that models can generate high-quality text.
- **Chat completion** allows models to engage in natural, interactive conversations with users over multiple turns.
- **Instruction tuning** fine-tunes models to be task-oriented and follow instructions reliably.

For example, a virtual assistant may use **chat completion** to hold a conversation with a user, then switch to an **instruction-tuned model** to follow commands such as "Summarize my email inbox" or "Find my last appointment."
