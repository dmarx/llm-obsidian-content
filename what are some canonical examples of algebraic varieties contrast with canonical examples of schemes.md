what are some canonical examples of algebraic varieties? contrast with canonical examples of schemes


**ASSISTANT**

In algebraic geometry, **algebraic varieties** and **schemes** represent two fundamental but conceptually distinct classes of geometric objects, each with its canonical examples that illustrate key ideas and differences between them. Let's explore some of these examples and highlight how varieties and schemes differ in their structure and usage.

### Canonical Examples of Algebraic Varieties

1. **Affine Varieties:**
   - **Linear Varieties**: These include lines and planes in $\mathbb{A}^n$, the $n$-dimensional affine space. For instance, the line given by $eqn$(y = mx + b)$$ in $\mathbb{A}^2$ is a simple example.
   - **Quadratic Curves**: Curves defined by quadratic equations such as ellipses, hyperbolas, and parabolas in $\mathbb{A}^2$. For example, the circle defined by $eqn$(x^2 + y^2 = 1)$$.

2. **Projective Varieties:**
   - **Conic Sections**: These can be considered in the projective plane $\mathbb{P}^2$, where they do not "go off to infinity". A projective conic can be given by $eqn$(x^2 + y^2 - z^2 = 0)$$.
   - **Elliptic Curves**: These are examples of smooth projective curves, often given in Weierstrass form by $eqn$(y^2z = x^3 + axz^2 + bz^3)$$ in $\mathbb{P}^2$, important in number theory and cryptography.

3. **Singular Varieties:**
   - **Cuspidal Cubic**: Given by $eqn$(y^2 = x^3)$$ in $\mathbb{A}^2$, this curve has a singularity at the origin (0,0).
   - **Nodal Cubic**: Another example is $eqn$(y^2 = x^3 - x^2)$$, which has a node, a type of mild singularity, at the origin.

### Canonical Examples of Schemes

1. **Spec of a Ring (Affine Schemes):**
   - **$\text{Spec}(\mathbb{Z})$**: The spectrum of the integers, a fundamental example in arithmetic geometry, representing the set of all prime ideals of $\mathbb{Z}$.
   - **$\text{Spec}(k[x]/(x^2))$**: Represents the dual numbers over a field $k$, a simple example of a scheme with nilpotent elements, where $(x^2)$ is the nilpotent ideal.

2. **Projective Schemes:**
   - **$\text{Proj}(k[x_0, x_1, x_2]/(x_0^2 + x_1^2 + x_2^2))$**: This could represent a projective variety over $\mathbb{P}^2$, but as a scheme, it also considers the structure sheaf including the behavior at points corresponding to non-reduced or embedded components.

3. **Schemes with Non-Reduced Structure:**
   - **Infinitesimal Thickenings**: For instance, considering $k[x]/(x^2)$ as an infinitesimally thickened point, capturing not just a point but also first-order infinitesimal information around it.

4. **Arithmetic Schemes:**
   - **$\text{Spec}(\mathbb{Z}[i])$**: Represents the Gaussian integers, an example of how schemes can extend number-theoretic properties to the geometry of numbers, considering both algebraic and topological properties.

### Contrast between Varieties and Schemes

- **Generality**: Varieties are zero sets of polynomials and are usually over algebraically closed fields, whereas schemes incorporate a wider class of rings and consider all prime ideals, not just maximal ones, and can include nilpotent elements.

- **Structure Sheaf**: While both varieties and schemes come equipped with a structure sheaf, schemes handle more general sheaves that can account for more complex local algebraic structures, including those with nilpotents and localization at non-maximal ideals.

- **Applications**: Varieties often suffice for classical problems in enumerative geometry and complex geometry, while schemes are crucial for modern algebraic geometry, especially in arithmetic and algebraic geometry where finer moduli problems and arithmetic aspects are considered.

These examples highlight the richness of algebraic structures handled in algebraic geometry, and the transition from varieties to schemes marks a significant evolution in the abstraction and depth of the field.
