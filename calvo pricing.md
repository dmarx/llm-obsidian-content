Calvo pricing


**ASSISTANT**

Calvo pricing is a widely used mechanism in macroeconomic models, particularly within the New Keynesian framework, to describe how firms adjust their prices over time. It provides a simple yet powerful way to model price stickiness, an essential feature that helps explain why monetary policy can have real effects on the economy.

### Key Concepts

1. **Price Stickiness**:
   Calvo pricing assumes that in any given period, only a fraction of firms can adjust their prices, while the rest keep their prices unchanged. This results in price stickiness, meaning that prices do not immediately respond to changes in economic conditions.

2. **Random Adjustment Probability**:
   The mechanism involves a probability, denoted as $\theta$, which represents the fraction of firms that cannot change their prices in a given period. Conversely, $1-\theta$ is the probability that a firm can adjust its price. The key assumption is that this adjustment opportunity is randomly distributed among firms.

3. **Staggered Price Setting**:
   Since only a subset of firms adjust their prices at any given time, price changes are staggered across the economy. This leads to gradual rather than instantaneous adjustments in the aggregate price level, contributing to the persistence of inflation and other macroeconomic variables.

### Mathematical Formalism

Consider an economy with a continuum of firms indexed by $i \in [0,1]$. Each firm produces a differentiated good and faces a probability $\theta$ of keeping its price unchanged and a probability $1-\theta$ of resetting its price optimally in each period.

- **Optimal Price Setting**:
  When a firm has the opportunity to adjust its price, it sets a new price $\bar{P}_t$ to maximize the expected present value of its future profits. The optimal price $\bar{P}_t$ is given by:
  $$ 
  \bar{P}_t = (1+\mu) \frac{\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (\beta \theta)^k \mathbb{E}_t [P_{t+k} MC_{t+k} Y_{t+k}]}{\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (\beta \theta)^k \mathbb{E}_t [P_{t+k} Y_{t+k}]} 
  $$
  where $\mu$ is the desired markup over marginal cost $MC_{t+k}$, $\beta$ is the discount factor, and $Y_{t+k}$ is the output.

- **Aggregate Price Level**:
  The aggregate price level $P_t$ is a weighted average of the prices set by firms:
  $$ 
  P_t = \left[ (1-\theta) \bar{P}_t^{1-\epsilon} + \theta P_{t-1}^{1-\epsilon} \right]^{\frac{1}{1-\epsilon}} 
  $$
  where $\epsilon$ is the elasticity of substitution between differentiated goods.

- **New Keynesian Phillips Curve (NKPC)**:
  Calvo pricing leads to the NKPC, which relates current inflation $\pi_t$ to expected future inflation $\mathbb{E}_t[\pi_{t+1}]$ and the real marginal cost $MC_t$:
  $$ 
  \pi_t = \beta \mathbb{E}_t[\pi_{t+1}] + \kappa MC_t 
  $$
  where $\kappa = \frac{(1-\theta)(1-\beta \theta)}{\theta}$ is a parameter that captures the degree of price stickiness.

### Implications

1. **Inflation Dynamics**:
   Calvo pricing explains why inflation is persistent and does not respond immediately to changes in monetary policy. The staggered price setting implies that even when some firms adjust their prices, others do not, leading to gradual changes in the aggregate price level.

2. **Monetary Policy Effectiveness**:
   Because prices are sticky, changes in nominal variables (such as the money supply or interest rates) can affect real variables (like output and employment) in the short run. This provides a rationale for active monetary policy to stabilize the economy.

3. **Microfoundations**:
   The Calvo model provides a microfounded explanation for the observed stickiness in prices, grounded in the behavior of optimizing firms. This enhances the theoretical rigor and empirical relevance of New Keynesian models.

### Applications

Calvo pricing is extensively used in [[Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) Models|DSGE models]] to analyze the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and various shocks on the economy. It is central to understanding the transmission mechanisms of policy interventions and the dynamics of inflation and output.

By incorporating Calvo pricing, economists can capture key features of real-world economies, such as the slow adjustment of prices and the impact of monetary policy on real activity, making it a cornerstone of modern macroeconomic analysis.
