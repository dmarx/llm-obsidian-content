fluctuation–dissipation theorem


**ASSISTANT**

The **fluctuation-dissipation theorem** (FDT) is a fundamental principle in statistical mechanics that relates the response of a system to external perturbations (dissipation) to its spontaneous fluctuations in thermal equilibrium. This theorem provides a deep connection between equilibrium properties and nonequilibrium dynamics, making it a powerful tool for analyzing a wide range of physical systems.

### Key Concepts

1. **Dissipation**: The irreversible process where the system loses energy to its surroundings, typically in the form of heat.
2. **Fluctuations**: Random deviations from the average behavior of a system due to thermal energy.

### The Theorem

The fluctuation-dissipation theorem states that the linear response of a system to a small external perturbation is directly related to the equilibrium fluctuations of the system. For a system in thermal equilibrium at temperature \(T\), the FDT can be expressed in various forms depending on the context, such as electrical circuits, mechanical systems, or Brownian motion.

### General Formulation

Consider a system described by a generalized coordinate \(x(t)\) and its conjugate force \(F(t)\). If the system is subjected to a small external perturbation, the response function \(R(t-t')\) describes how the system reacts to this perturbation:
$$
\langle x(t) \rangle_F = \int_{-\infty}^t R(t-t') F(t') \, dt',
```
where \(\langle x(t) \rangle_F\) is the expected value of \(x(t)\) in the presence of the force \(F(t)\).

The fluctuation-dissipation theorem relates this response function \(R(t)\) to the correlation function of the equilibrium fluctuations \(C(t)\):
$$
R(t) = \frac{1}{k_B T} \frac{dC(t)}{dt},
```
where \(C(t) = \langle x(t) x(0) \rangle\) is the autocorrelation function of the fluctuation \(x(t)\) in equilibrium, \(k_B\) is the Boltzmann constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

### Applications

1. **Brownian Motion**: For a Brownian particle, the Langevin equation describes its motion. The FDT relates the random thermal force acting on the particle to the viscous damping force.
   - **Langevin Equation**:
     $$
     m \ddot{x}(t) + \gamma \dot{x}(t) = \sqrt{2 \gamma k_B T} \eta(t),
     $$
     where \(\gamma\) is the friction coefficient and \(\eta(t)\) is a delta-correlated Gaussian white noise.
   - **FDT**: The power spectral density of the thermal noise \(\langle \eta(t) \eta(t') \rangle = 2 \gamma k_B T \delta(t - t')\) is related to the friction coefficient \(\gamma\).

2. **Electrical Circuits**: In electrical circuits, the Johnson-Nyquist noise describes the thermal noise generated by a resistor. The FDT relates the noise power spectral density to the resistance and temperature.
   - **Nyquist Theorem**:
     $$
     S_V(f) = 4 k_B T R,
     $$
     where \(S_V(f)\) is the power spectral density of the voltage fluctuations across the resistor \(R\).

3. **Mechanical Systems**: In mechanical oscillators, the FDT relates the random forces due to thermal agitation to the damping coefficient of the system.

### Derivation for Brownian Motion

Consider a Brownian particle with position \(x(t)\) described by the overdamped Langevin equation:
$$
\gamma \dot{x}(t) = -\frac{\partial V(x)}{\partial x} + \sqrt{2 \gamma k_B T} \eta(t),
```
where \(\gamma\) is the friction coefficient, \(V(x)\) is the potential, and \(\eta(t)\) is Gaussian white noise with zero mean and \(\langle \eta(t) \eta(t') \rangle = \delta(t - t')\).

The response function \(R(t)\) describes how the particle's position responds to an external force \(F(t)\):
$$
\langle x(t) \rangle_F = \int_0^t R(t - t') F(t') \, dt'.
```

Using the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, the response function \(R(t)\) is related to the equilibrium autocorrelation function \(C(t) = \langle x(t) x(0) \rangle\) by:
$$
R(t) = \frac{1}{k_B T} \frac{dC(t)}{dt}.
```

In equilibrium, the autocorrelation function for the Brownian particle in a [[harmonic potential]] \(V(x) = \frac{1}{2} k x^2\) is:
$$
C(t) = \left\langle x(t) x(0) \right\rangle = \frac{k_B T}{k} e^{-\frac{k}{\gamma} t}.
```

Thus, the response function is:
$$
R(t) = \frac{1}{k_B T} \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{k_B T}{k} e^{-\frac{k}{\gamma} t} \right) = \frac{1}{\gamma} e^{-\frac{k}{\gamma} t}.
```

### Conclusion

The fluctuation-dissipation theorem provides a profound link between equilibrium fluctuations and nonequilibrium responses in a system. It is a cornerstone of statistical mechanics and thermodynamics, enabling the analysis of systems ranging from Brownian motion to electrical circuits and mechanical oscillators.
