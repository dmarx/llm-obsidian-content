Mohring effect


**ASSISTANT**

The **Mohring Effect** is a concept in transportation economics that describes a positive feedback loop between the frequency of public transit services and the demand for those services. Named after economist Herbert Mohring, who described it in his 1972 paper, the effect captures the idea that increased demand for public transit can lead to higher service frequency, which in turn reduces waiting times and makes transit more attractive, further increasing demand.

### Key Components of the Mohring Effect

1. **Increased Demand Leads to Higher Frequency**: As more people use public transportation, the transit agency can justify increasing the frequency of service. Higher demand often translates into more revenue, allowing the transit system to operate more vehicles on a given route.

2. **Higher Frequency Reduces Waiting Times**: With more frequent services, the average waiting time for passengers at stations or stops decreases. This reduction in waiting time is crucial because one of the main components of a commuter’s perceived travel time includes not only the actual time spent traveling but also the time spent waiting.

3. **Lower Generalized Travel Costs**: Lower waiting times effectively reduce the "generalized cost" of using public transit, which includes all components of a trip's inconvenience—such as time spent waiting, travel time, transfers, and comfort. The generalized cost can be thought of as a composite measure that incorporates both monetary and non-monetary costs of travel.

4. **Positive Feedback Loop**: The reduction in generalized costs makes public transit more attractive, encouraging more people to switch from other modes of transportation (like driving) to public transit. This increase in ridership can justify further increases in service frequency, creating a virtuous cycle or positive feedback loop.

### Mathematical Formalization of the Mohring Effect

To understand the Mohring Effect mathematically, let’s define a few key terms:

- **Demand for Transit**: Let \( Q \) represent the demand for transit services (e.g., the number of passengers per hour).
- **Frequency of Service**: Let \( F(Q) \) denote the frequency of transit service (e.g., the number of buses or trains per hour), which is an increasing function of demand \( Q \). 

Given a relationship \( F(Q) \propto Q \), this implies that the frequency is directly proportional to the demand.

- **Average Waiting Time**: Let \( W(F) \) represent the average waiting time for a passenger, which is inversely related to the frequency of service \( F \). A standard assumption is that the average waiting time is roughly half of the headway (the time interval between two consecutive vehicles):

\[
W(F) = \frac{1}{2F}.
\]

Combining these, if frequency \( F \) increases with demand \( Q \), the average waiting time \( W(F(Q)) \) decreases as \( Q \) increases.

- **Generalized Cost of Transit**: Let \( C(Q) \) be the generalized cost of using transit, which includes both the waiting time and in-vehicle travel time:

\[
C(Q) = \alpha W(F(Q)) + \beta T,
\]

where:
- \( \alpha \) is the value passengers place on waiting time.
- \( \beta \) is the value passengers place on in-vehicle travel time.
- \( T \) is the in-vehicle travel time, which could remain constant or vary depending on network congestion effects.

Since \( W(F(Q)) = \frac{1}{2F(Q)} \) and \( F(Q) \propto Q \), the generalized cost \( C(Q) \) decreases as \( Q \) increases due to reduced waiting time.

### Implications of the Mohring Effect

1. **Economies of Scale in Public Transit**: The Mohring Effect illustrates that public transit systems exhibit **economies of scale**. As ridership increases, the system becomes more efficient, offering better service with lower average costs per passenger. This phenomenon is crucial for understanding why urban transit systems can become more efficient as they grow, in contrast to private car use, which often leads to increased congestion as more users participate.

2. **Investment Justification**: The effect provides a justification for investments in public transit infrastructure and service frequency improvements. Policies that increase the attractiveness of transit (e.g., subsidies, service frequency increases, infrastructure enhancements) can trigger the positive feedback loop described by the Mohring Effect, leading to increased ridership and further benefits.

3. **Policy Implications for Urban Planning**: Urban planners and policymakers can leverage the Mohring Effect by designing transit systems that balance service frequency and demand. For example, during peak hours, increasing frequency can attract more riders, which justifies maintaining or increasing those service levels.

4. **Sustainable Urban Mobility**: The Mohring Effect supports the shift towards sustainable urban mobility by highlighting the benefits of robust public transit networks. As cities grow and car congestion worsens, investing in public transit becomes not just beneficial but essential for managing urban transportation needs effectively.

### Conclusion

The **Mohring Effect** is a foundational concept in transportation economics that explains the mutually reinforcing relationship between transit service frequency and ridership demand. By highlighting the positive feedback loop between increased demand and improved service levels, the Mohring Effect underscores the potential for public transit systems to become more efficient and attractive as they grow, supporting policies that prioritize public transit over automobile dependency for sustainable urban mobility.
