adamw algorithm


**ASSISTANT**

The AdamW algorithm is an extension of the Adam optimization algorithm that includes a decoupled weight decay regularization. This method was proposed by Ilya Loshchilov and Frank Hutter in their paper "Decoupled Weight Decay Regularization." AdamW improves upon the original Adam by applying weight decay directly to the weights, rather than indirectly through the gradient updates. This decoupling leads to better generalization performance and stability.

### Background

In traditional gradient descent with weight decay, the update rule includes both the gradient of the loss function and a term that penalizes the magnitude of the weights:
\[ \theta_{t+1} = \theta_t - \eta (\nabla L(\theta_t) + \lambda \theta_t), \]
where \( \lambda \) is the weight decay coefficient.

In Adam, the weight decay is applied indirectly through the adaptive learning rates, which can cause issues with the effective learning rate and complicate the regularization effects. AdamW addresses this by decoupling the weight decay from the gradient updates.

### AdamW Algorithm

AdamW introduces a direct weight decay term separate from the adaptive gradient updates. Here are the steps for the AdamW algorithm:

#### Algorithm

1. **Initialization**: Initialize parameters \( \theta_0 \), first moment vector \( m_0 = 0 \), second moment vector \( v_0 = 0 \). Set hyperparameters \(\alpha\) (learning rate), \(\beta_1\) (exponential decay rate for first moment estimates), \(\beta_2\) (exponential decay rate for second moment estimates), and \(\epsilon\) (small constant for numerical stability). Initialize the weight decay coefficient \(\lambda\).

2. **Update Rule**:
   - At each iteration \( t \), compute the gradients \( g_t = \nabla L(\theta_t) \).
   - Update biased first moment estimate:
     \[ m_t = \beta_1 m_{t-1} + (1 - \beta_1) g_t. \]
   - Update biased second moment estimate:
     \[ v_t = \beta_2 v_{t-1} + (1 - \beta_2) g_t^2. \]
   - Compute bias-corrected first moment estimate:
     \[ \hat{m}_t = \frac{m_t}{1 - \beta_1^t}. \]
   - Compute bias-corrected second moment estimate:
     \[ \hat{v}_t = \frac{v_t}{1 - \beta_2^t}. \]
   - Update parameters with decoupled weight decay:
     \[ \theta_{t+1} = \theta_t - \alpha \left( \frac{\hat{m}_t}{\sqrt{\hat{v}_t} + \epsilon} + \lambda \theta_t \right). \]

### Key Differences from Adam

1. **Decoupled Weight Decay**: In AdamW, the weight decay is applied directly to the weights rather than being part of the gradient update. This decoupling simplifies the regularization term and improves training dynamics.
2. **Regularization**: The explicit weight decay term \(\lambda \theta_t\) helps in preventing overfitting by penalizing large weights, leading to better generalization.

### Advantages

- **Improved Generalization**: By decoupling weight decay from the gradient update, AdamW tends to provide better generalization performance compared to Adam.
- **Simplicity**: The direct application of weight decay makes the implementation simpler and more interpretable.
- **Stability**: The decoupling helps in maintaining stable updates and prevents the effective learning rate from being distorted by the weight decay term.

### Practical Implementation

Here is a simple implementation of the AdamW algorithm in Python:

```python
import numpy as np

def adamw_update(parameters, gradients, m, v, t, alpha, beta1, beta2, epsilon, weight_decay):
    m = beta1 * m + (1 - beta1) * gradients
    v = beta2 * v + (1 - beta2) * (gradients ** 2)
    m_hat = m / (1 - beta1 ** t)
    v_hat = v / (1 - beta2 ** t)
    
    parameters = parameters - alpha * (m_hat / (np.sqrt(v_hat) + epsilon) + weight_decay * parameters)
    
    return parameters, m, v

# Example usage
parameters = np.array([0.5, -0.3])  # initial parameters
gradients = np.array([0.1, -0.2])   # gradient of the loss function
m = np.zeros_like(parameters)        # first moment vector
v = np.zeros_like(parameters)        # second moment vector
alpha = 0.001                        # learning rate
beta1 = 0.9                          # decay rate for first moment
beta2 = 0.999                        # decay rate for second moment
epsilon = 1e-8                       # small constant for numerical stability
weight_decay = 0.01                  # weight decay coefficient
t = 1                                # time step

parameters, m, v = adamw_update(parameters, gradients, m, v, t, alpha, beta1, beta2, epsilon, weight_decay)
print(parameters)
```
