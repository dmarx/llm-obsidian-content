## Trace Class Operators

In functional analysis, [[trace class operators]] are a specific class of compact operators on a Hilbert space that possess certain summability properties. These operators play a critical role in the theory of operator algebras, quantum mechanics, and various branches of mathematics.

### Definition

Let \( \mathcal{H} \) be a Hilbert space. An operator \( T: \mathcal{H} \to \mathcal{H} \) is called a trace class operator if it satisfies one (and therefore all) of the following equivalent conditions:

1. The sum of the singular values (the eigenvalues of \( |T| = \sqrt{T^*T} \)) is finite.
2. There exists an orthonormal basis \( \{e_n\} \) of \( \mathcal{H} \) such that the sum of the absolute values of the matrix elements \( \langle T e_n, e_n \rangle \) is finite.
3. The operator \( |T| \) (defined as \( |T| = \sqrt{T^*T} \)) belongs to the \( \mathcal{L}^1 \) class of operators.

Mathematically, these conditions can be expressed as:
$$
\|T\|_1 = \sum_{n} s_n(T) < \infty,
$$
where \( s_n(T) \) are the singular values of \( T \).

### Trace and Trace Norm

#### Trace of an Operator

For a trace class operator \( T \), the trace \( \mathrm{Tr}(T) \) is defined as:
$$
\mathrm{Tr}(T) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \langle T e_n, e_n \rangle,
$$
where \( \{e_n\} \) is any orthonormal basis of \( \mathcal{H} \). The value of the trace is independent of the choice of basis.

#### Trace Norm

The trace norm \( \|T\|_1 \) of a trace class operator \( T \) is given by:
$$
\|T\|_1 = \mathrm{Tr}(|T|) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} s_n(T),
$$
where \( s_n(T) \) are the singular values of \( T \).

### Properties

1. **Linearity**: The trace is a linear functional, meaning \( \mathrm{Tr}(aT + bS) = a\mathrm{Tr}(T) + b\mathrm{Tr}(S) \) for any trace class operators \( T \) and \( S \) and scalars \( a \) and \( b \).
2. **Cyclic Property**: If \( T \) and \( S \) are such that \( TS \) and \( ST \) are trace class, then \( \mathrm{Tr}(TS) = \mathrm{Tr}(ST) \).
3. **Positivity**: If \( T \) is a positive trace class operator (i.e., \( \langle T x, x \rangle \ge 0 \) for all \( x \in \mathcal{H} \)), then \( \mathrm{Tr}(T) \ge 0 \).
4. **Norm Inequality**: For any trace class operator \( T \), the trace norm satisfies \( \|T\| \le \|T\|_1 \), where \( \|T\| \) is the operator norm.

### Examples

1. **Finite Rank Operators**: Any operator of finite rank is a trace class operator. For a finite rank operator \( T = \sum_{i=1}^k \lambda_i \langle \cdot, u_i \rangle v_i \), the trace norm is \( \|T\|_1 = \sum_{i=1}^k |\lambda_i| \).
2. **Hilbert–Schmidt Operators**: If \( T \) is a Hilbert–Schmidt operator with matrix elements \( T_{ij} \) in an orthonormal basis, then \( T \) is trace class if and only if \( \sum_{i,j} |T_{ij}| < \infty \). In this case, the trace norm is given by \( \|T\|_1 = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \sigma_i \), where \( \sigma_i \) are the singular values of \( T \).

### Applications

1. **Quantum Mechanics**: Trace class operators are used to describe density matrices, which represent states in quantum mechanics. The trace of the density matrix gives the total probability, which must be 1.
2. **Operator Algebras**: In the theory of operator algebras, trace class operators are important for defining traces on \( C^* \)-algebras and von Neumann algebras.
3. **Spectral Theory**: Trace class operators are crucial in spectral theory, where they help analyze the spectrum of operators and study eigenvalue problems.
