Behavioral Game Theory

### Behavioral Game Theory

**Behavioral Game Theory** extends traditional game theory by incorporating insights from psychology and experimental economics into the analysis of strategic interactions. While traditional game theory assumes that players are perfectly rational and always act to maximize their utility, behavioral game theory acknowledges that players are influenced by cognitive biases, social preferences, and [[bounded rationality]].

### Key Concepts

1. **Bounded Rationality**: Players have limited cognitive resources and cannot process all available information or foresee all potential consequences of their actions.
2. **Cognitive Biases**: Systematic deviations from rationality, such as overconfidence, anchoring, and loss aversion, that affect decision-making.
3. **Social Preferences**: Players care about fairness, reciprocity, and the payoffs of others, not just their own material payoffs.
4. **Learning and Adaptation**: Players adjust their strategies over time based on past experiences and observed behaviors of others.

### Applications of Behavioral Game Theory

1. **Ultimatum Game**: 
   - Traditional Prediction: The proposer offers the smallest possible amount, and the responder accepts it.
   - Behavioral Insights: Proposers often offer a fairer split, and responders frequently reject low offers due to fairness concerns.
   
2. **Public Goods Game**:
   - Traditional Prediction: Players free-ride, contributing nothing to the public good.
   - Behavioral Insights: Many players contribute more than predicted due to altruism and reciprocity, although contributions decline over repeated play as free-riding becomes more prevalent.

3. **Trust Game**:
   - Traditional Prediction: The second player (trustee) returns nothing, anticipating the first playerâ€™s (trustor's) expectation.
   - Behavioral Insights: Trustors often send money, and trustees frequently return a fair share, driven by trust and reciprocity.

### Theoretical Frameworks

#### 1. **Prospect Theory in Games**
Prospect theory, developed by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, describes how people make choices under risk. It can be incorporated into game theory to account for how players perceive gains and losses differently.

- **Value Function**: Players value gains and losses relative to a reference point, typically exhibiting loss aversion where losses loom larger than gains.
- **Probability Weighting**: Players overweigh small probabilities and underweigh large probabilities.

#### 2. **Quantal Response Equilibrium (QRE)**
QRE models players as responding probabilistically to strategies, with higher-probability responses given to higher-utility actions, incorporating [[bounded rationality]].

- **Logit QRE**: Players choose strategies with probabilities proportional to the exponential of the expected utility, adjusted by a sensitivity parameter $\lambda$ that reflects the level of rationality.

$$
P_i(s_i) = \frac{\exp(\lambda \cdot U_i(s_i))}{\sum_{s_i' \in S_i} \exp(\lambda \cdot U_i(s_i'))}
$$

where $P_i(s_i)$ is the probability that player $i$ chooses strategy $s_i$, and $U_i(s_i)$ is the utility of strategy $s_i$.

#### 3. **Level-K Reasoning**
Players are modeled as having different levels of reasoning:
- **Level-0**: Players choose strategies randomly.
- **Level-1**: Players best respond to the strategies of Level-0 players.
- **Level-K**: Players best respond to the strategies of Level-(K-1) players.

This iterative process captures [[bounded rationality]] and strategic depth.

### Mathematical Formalism

Consider a simple two-player game where player 1 and player 2 can choose strategies $A$ or $B$. The payoffs are influenced by fairness concerns and cognitive biases.

1. **Utility Function Incorporating Fairness**:
$$
U_i(s_i, s_j) = \pi_i(s_i, s_j) - \alpha \cdot \max(0, \pi_j(s_j, s_i) - \pi_i(s_i, s_j))
$$

where $\pi_i(s_i, s_j)$ is the material payoff for player $i$ given strategies $s_i$ and $s_j$, and $\alpha$ represents the weight player $i$ places on fairness.

2. **Quantal Response Equilibrium**:
$$
P_1(A) = \frac{\exp(\lambda \cdot U_1(A, s_2))}{\exp(\lambda \cdot U_1(A, s_2)) + \exp(\lambda \cdot U_1(B, s_2))}
$$
$$
P_2(A) = \frac{\exp(\lambda \cdot U_2(A, s_1))}{\exp(\lambda \cdot U_2(A, s_1)) + \exp(\lambda \cdot U_2(B, s_1))}
$$

where $P_1(A)$ and $P_2(A)$ are the probabilities that players 1 and 2 choose strategy $A$, respectively.

### Conclusion

Behavioral game theory provides a richer and more realistic framework for analyzing strategic interactions by accounting for [[bounded rationality]], cognitive biases, and social preferences. By incorporating these elements into game-theoretic models, we gain a deeper understanding of how real-world players make decisions and how these decisions can deviate from traditional rational predictions. This approach has profound implications for designing policies and mechanisms that better align with actual human behavior.
