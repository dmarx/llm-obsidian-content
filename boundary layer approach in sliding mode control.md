### Boundary Layer Approach in Sliding Mode Control

To mitigate chattering in [[sliding mode control]] (SMC), one effective technique is to introduce a boundary layer around the sliding surface. This approach smooths the control action by replacing the discontinuous signum function with a continuous approximation, such as the saturation function.

### Sliding Mode Control with Boundary Layer

#### Problem with Chattering

In classical SMC, the control law typically includes a term with the signum function:
$$
u = u_{\text{eq}} - K \cdot \text{sign}(S(x)),
$$
where:
- \( u_{\text{eq}} \) is the equivalent control that maintains \( S(x) = 0 \),
- \( K \) is a positive gain,
- \( S(x) \) is the sliding surface.

The discontinuity in the signum function \(\text{sign}(S(x))\) leads to chattering, which is detrimental in practical applications.

#### Boundary Layer Concept

To alleviate chattering, a boundary layer is introduced around the sliding surface. Within this boundary layer, a continuous approximation of the signum function is used, such as the saturation function \(\text{sat}(S(x) / \phi)\), where \(\phi\) is the boundary layer thickness.

#### Saturation Function

The saturation function is defined as:
$$
\text{sat}\left( \frac{S(x)}{\phi} \right) = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } S(x) > \phi, \\
\frac{S(x)}{\phi} & \text{if } |S(x)| \leq \phi, \\
-1 & \text{if } S(x) < -\phi.
\end{cases}
$$

The modified control law with a boundary layer becomes:
$$
u = u_{\text{eq}} - K \cdot \text{sat}\left( \frac{S(x)}{\phi} \right).
$$

### Design Steps

1. **Define the Sliding Surface**:
   The sliding surface \( S(x) \) should be chosen to reflect the desired system behavior. For example, in a second-order system, a common choice is:
   $$
   S(x) = \dot{x} + \lambda x,
   $$
   where \( \lambda \) is a positive constant.

2. **Determine the Equivalent Control**:
   The equivalent control \( u_{\text{eq}} \) is designed to keep \( \dot{S}(x) = 0 \). This is found by solving:
   $$
   \dot{S}(x) = 0 \implies \frac{d}{dt}(\dot{x} + \lambda x) = 0.
   $$

3. **Implement the Boundary Layer Control**:
   Substitute the saturation function into the control law:
   $$
   u = u_{\text{eq}} - K \cdot \text{sat}\left( \frac{S(x)}{\phi} \right).
   $$

### Example: Second-Order System

Consider a second-order system:
$$
\ddot{x} + b\dot{x} + ax = u,
$$
where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants.

1. **Define the Sliding Surface**:
   $$
   S(x, \dot{x}) = \dot{x} + \lambda x,
   $$
   where \( \lambda > 0 \) is chosen to ensure desired dynamics on the sliding surface.

2. **Equivalent Control**:
   To find \( u_{\text{eq}} \), set \( \dot{S}(x, \dot{x}) = 0 \):
   $$
   \dot{S}(x, \dot{x}) = \ddot{x} + \lambda \dot{x} = -b\dot{x} - ax + u + \lambda \dot{x} = 0,
   $$
   which gives:
   $$
   u_{\text{eq}} = -\lambda \dot{x} - ax - b\dot{x}.
   $$

3. **Boundary Layer Control**:
   Incorporate the boundary layer into the control law:
   $$
   u = -\lambda \dot{x} - ax - b\dot{x} - K \cdot \text{sat}\left( \frac{\dot{x} + \lambda x}{\phi} \right).
   $$

### Analysis and Benefits

- **Reduction of Chattering**: The use of the saturation function smooths the control action near the sliding surface, significantly reducing chattering.
- **Robustness**: The system retains the robustness of classical [[sliding mode control]] against disturbances and model uncertainties.
- **Practical Implementation**: The continuous control action is more feasible for practical implementations, reducing wear and tear on mechanical components and improving overall system performance.

### Conclusion

Introducing a boundary layer around the sliding surface in [[sliding mode control]] is an effective method to mitigate chattering while maintaining the robustness benefits of SMC. The saturation function provides a smooth transition in the control law, enhancing practical applicability in various engineering systems.
