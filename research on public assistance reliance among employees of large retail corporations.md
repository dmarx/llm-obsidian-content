### Research on Public Assistance Reliance Among Employees of Large Retail Corporations

Research has demonstrated that a significant number of employees at large retail corporations, such as Walmart, rely on public assistance programs to supplement their low wages. This situation highlights the extent to which taxpayers subsidize low-wage work in these companies.

### Key Findings

1. **Extent of Public Assistance Reliance:**
   - **UC Berkeley Labor Center Study:** A study by the UC Berkeley Labor Center found that Walmart workers are among the largest groups of recipients of public assistance programs. The study showed that Walmart workers rely heavily on programs like Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and housing assistance.
   - **National Employment Law Project (NELP):** NELP's research indicates that many workers in large retail chains, including Walmart, require public assistance to make ends meet due to low wages and insufficient benefits.

2. **Cost to Taxpayers:**
   - **Public Assistance Costs:** The UC Berkeley Labor Center estimated that Walmart employeesâ€™ reliance on public assistance programs costs U.S. taxpayers approximately $6.2 billion annually. This includes $3 billion in healthcare costs and $1.6 billion in food assistance.
   - **Economic Policy Institute (EPI):** EPI's analysis found that the public cost of low wages in the retail industry, including Walmart, amounts to billions of dollars each year. This significant public expenditure effectively subsidizes the labor costs of these large corporations.

3. **Wages and Benefits:**
   - **Low Wages:** Walmart and similar large retailers often pay wages that are at or near the minimum wage, which is insufficient to cover basic living expenses for many workers, particularly those with families.
   - **Inadequate Benefits:** Many retail workers, including those at Walmart, do not receive adequate health insurance, paid leave, or retirement benefits, further necessitating reliance on public assistance.

### Implications

1. **Economic Inequality:**
   - **Income Disparities:** The reliance on public assistance by workers at highly profitable corporations like Walmart exacerbates income inequality, as taxpayers effectively subsidize the low wages paid by these companies.
   - **Corporate Profits vs. Worker Wages:** Despite substantial profits and high executive compensation, many large retailers continue to pay low wages, highlighting a significant disparity between corporate earnings and worker compensation.

2. **Public Expenditure:**
   - **Taxpayer Burden:** The significant reliance on public assistance by employees of large corporations imposes a substantial burden on taxpayers, diverting public funds that could be used for other social investments.
   - **Economic Efficiency:** Subsidizing low wages through public assistance programs can be seen as an inefficient use of public resources, as it supports business models that rely on underpaying workers.

### Policy Recommendations

1. **Raising the Minimum Wage:**
   - **Living Wage Standards:** Implementing a higher minimum wage that reflects the cost of living can reduce the need for public assistance among low-wage workers. A living wage ensures that full-time workers can support themselves and their families without relying on public subsidies.
   - **Indexing to Inflation:** Indexing the minimum wage to inflation can maintain its purchasing power over time, preventing wage erosion and reducing future reliance on public assistance.

2. **Enhancing Labor Standards:**
   - **Fair Scheduling Practices:** Enacting fair scheduling laws can provide workers with more predictable hours and income, improving their financial stability.
   - **Pro-Rated Benefits:** Requiring large employers to provide pro-rated benefits for part-time workers can reduce the gap in benefits between part-time and full-time employees, thereby decreasing reliance on public assistance.

3. **Employer Responsibility Policies:**
   - **Penalty for Low-Wage Employers:** Introducing penalties or taxes on large employers with a significant number of employees relying on public assistance can incentivize higher wages and better benefits. These penalties could fund public assistance programs directly.
   - **Disclosure Requirements:** Mandating that large corporations disclose the extent to which their employees rely on public assistance can increase transparency and accountability, encouraging better labor practices.

4. **Expanding Access to Benefits:**
   - **Universal Healthcare:** Implementing universal healthcare coverage can reduce the need for employer-provided health insurance and decrease workers' reliance on Medicaid.
   - **Income Support Programs:** Expanding income support programs, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), can supplement low wages and reduce the need for public assistance.

### Conclusion

Research clearly shows that many employees of large retail corporations like Walmart rely on public assistance programs due to low wages and insufficient benefits. This reliance imposes a significant burden on taxpayers and highlights the need for policy reforms to address the root causes of low-wage work. By raising the minimum wage, enhancing labor standards, implementing employer responsibility policies, and expanding access to benefits, policymakers can reduce the reliance on public assistance among low-wage workers and promote a more equitable and efficient economy.
