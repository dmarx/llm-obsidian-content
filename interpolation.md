In mathematics and computer science, "interpolation" refers to the process of estimating unknown values that fall within the range of a discrete set of known data points. Interpolation is a crucial technique in many areas such as numerical analysis, computer graphics, data fitting, and predictive modeling. It enables the construction of new data points within the range of a discrete set of known data points.

### Types of Interpolation

1. **Linear Interpolation**: This is the simplest form of interpolation. Linear interpolation between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) assumes that the points lie on a straight line, and the value at any point \(x\) on this line can be calculated using the formula:
   $$
   y = y_1 + \frac{(y_2 - y_1)}{(x_2 - x_1)} (x - x_1)
   $$
   This method is fast and easy but can be inaccurate over large intervals or non-linear functions.

2. **Polynomial Interpolation**: This method involves fitting a polynomial of degree \(n-1\) through \(n\) data points. It guarantees a perfect fit at the given points but can exhibit unwanted oscillations and inaccuracies between the points (Runge
