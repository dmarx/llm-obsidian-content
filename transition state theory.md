# Transition State Theory

Transition State Theory (TST) is a theoretical framework that explains the kinetics of [[elementary reactions]] by examining the statistical properties of the [[transition state]], a high-energy configuration along the [[reaction coordinate]] connecting reactants and products. Developed independently by [[Henry Eyring]], [[Meredith Gwynne Evans]], and [[Michael Polanyi]] in the 1930s, TST provides a fundamental connection between thermodynamic properties and reaction rates, serving as a cornerstone of [[chemical kinetics]] and [[reaction dynamics]].

## Fundamental Assumptions

TST is built upon several key assumptions:

1. **[[Born-Oppenheimer approximation]]**: Electronic and nuclear motions can be separated, allowing the construction of a [[potential energy surface]] (PES).

2. **[[Equilibrium assumption]]**: The reactant molecules and the transition state exist in [[quasi-equilibrium]], implying that the [[Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution]] applies to both.

3. **[[No recrossing]]**: Once the system crosses the [[dividing surface]] (transition state) in the direction of products, it never returns to reactants without first forming products.

4. **[[Classical motion]]**: Nuclear motions are treated classically, although quantum corrections can be incorporated.

5. **[[Reaction coordinate separability]]**: The reaction coordinate can be separated from the remaining degrees of freedom.

## Mathematical Formulation

### Rate Constant Expression

The TST rate constant for a bimolecular reaction is given by:

$$k_{\text{TST}} = \frac{k_B T}{h} \frac{Q^{\ddagger}}{Q_A Q_B} e^{-\Delta E_0 / k_B T}$$

Where:
- $k_B$ is the [[Boltzmann constant]]
- $T$ is the absolute temperature
- $h$ is [[Planck's constant]]
- $Q^{\ddagger}$ is the [[partition function]] of the transition state (excluding the reaction coordinate)
- $Q_A$ and $Q_B$ are the partition functions of reactants A and B
- $\Delta E_0$ is the [[activation energy]] (energy difference between transition state and reactants at 0 K)

For a unimolecular reaction, the expression simplifies to:

$$k_{\text{TST}} = \frac{k_B T}{h} \frac{Q^{\ddagger}}{Q_A} e^{-\Delta E_0 / k_B T}$$

### Eyring Equation

The Eyring equation relates the rate constant to [[activation enthalpy]] and [[activation entropy]]:

$$k_{\text{TST}} = \frac{k_B T}{h} e^{\Delta S^{\ddagger} / k_B} e^{-\Delta H^{\ddagger} / k_B T}$$

Where:
- $\Delta S^{\ddagger}$ is the [[activation entropy]]
- $\Delta H^{\ddagger}$ is the [[activation enthalpy]]

This can be rearranged into a linear form:

$$\ln \left( \frac{k_{\text{TST}}}{T} \right) = \ln \left( \frac{k_B}{h} \right) + \frac{\Delta S^{\ddagger}}{k_B} - \frac{\Delta H^{\ddagger}}{k_B T}$$

Allowing experimental determination of activation parameters through [[Eyring plots]].

### Statistical Mechanical Formulation

In terms of statistical mechanics, the rate constant can be expressed as:

$$k_{\text{TST}} = \frac{1}{h\beta} \frac{\int e^{-\beta H(\mathbf{p}, \mathbf{q})} \delta(\xi(\mathbf{q}) - \xi^{\ddagger}) |\dot{\xi}| \Theta(\dot{\xi}) d\mathbf{p} d\mathbf{q}}{\int e^{-\beta H(\mathbf{p}, \mathbf{q})} \Theta(-\xi(\mathbf{q})) d\mathbf{p} d\mathbf{q}}$$

Where:
- $\beta = 1/k_B T$
- $H(\mathbf{p}, \mathbf{q})$ is the [[Hamiltonian]]
- $\xi(\mathbf{q})$ is the [[reaction coordinate]]
- $\xi^{\ddagger}$ is the location of the transition state
- $\Theta$ is the [[Heaviside step function]]
- $\delta$ is the [[Dirac delta function]]
- $\dot{\xi}$ is the velocity along the reaction coordinate

## Variational Transition State Theory

[[Variational Transition State Theory]] (VTST) addresses the recrossing problem by optimizing the location of the dividing surface to minimize the rate constant:

$$k_{\text{VTST}} = \min_{\xi^{\ddagger}} k_{\text{TST}}(\xi^{\ddagger})$$

This ensures that the calculated rate is an upper bound to the exact rate.

### Canonical Variational Theory

In [[Canonical Variational Theory]] (CVT), the dividing surface is placed at the maximum of the [[free energy profile]] along the reaction coordinate:

$$\xi_{\text{CVT}}^{\ddagger} = \text{argmax}_{\xi} \Delta F(\xi)$$

Where $\Delta F(\xi)$ is the [[free energy of activation]] as a function of the reaction coordinate.

### Microcanonical Variational Theory

[[Microcanonical Variational Theory]] (μVT) minimizes the rate constant at each energy level separately:

$$k_{\text{μVT}}(E) = \min_{\xi^{\ddagger}} k_{\text{TST}}(E, \xi^{\ddagger})$$

The thermal rate constant is then obtained by averaging over the [[Boltzmann distribution]]:

$$k_{\text{μVT}} = \int k_{\text{μVT}}(E) \rho(E) e^{-\beta E} dE$$

Where $\rho(E)$ is the [[density of states]].

## Quantum Effects

### Tunneling Corrections

Quantum [[tunneling]] allows reactions to proceed through energy barriers rather than over them. The simplest correction is the [[Wigner tunneling correction]]:

$$\kappa_{\text{Wigner}} = 1 + \frac{1}{24} \left( \frac{h\nu^{\ddagger}}{k_B T} \right)^2$$

Where $\nu^{\ddagger}$ is the [[imaginary frequency]] associated with the transition state.

More sophisticated approaches include:
- [[Bell tunneling correction]]
- [[Eckart barrier penetration]]
- [[Small-curvature tunneling]] (SCT)
- [[Large-curvature tunneling]] (LCT)

### Zero-Point Energy Corrections

[[Zero-point energy]] (ZPE) corrections account for quantum vibrational effects:

$$\Delta E_0^{\text{corr}} = \Delta E_0 + \left( \sum_i \frac{1}{2} h\nu_i^{\ddagger} - \sum_j \frac{1}{2} h\nu_j^R \right)$$

Where $\nu_i^{\ddagger}$ and $\nu_j^R$ are the vibrational frequencies of the transition state and reactants, respectively.

## Generalized Transition State Theory

### Multidimensional Tunneling

[[Multidimensional tunneling]] accounts for coupling between the reaction coordinate and other degrees of freedom:

$$k_{\text{GTST}} = \kappa^{\text{mult}} \cdot k_{\text{VTST}}$$

Where $\kappa^{\text{mult}}$ is a multidimensional tunneling coefficient.

### Reactive Flux Formulation

The [[reactive flux formulation]] expresses the rate constant in terms of the time-dependent flux through the dividing surface:

$$k(t) = \frac{\langle \dot{\xi}(0) \delta(\xi(0) - \xi^{\ddagger}) \Theta(\xi(t) - \xi^{\ddagger}) \rangle}{\langle \Theta(-\xi(0)) \rangle}$$

For $t \rightarrow \infty$, this approaches the exact rate constant. The TST approximation corresponds to $t = 0^+$.

## Applications and Extensions

### Enzyme Kinetics

[[Enzymatic TST]] (ETST) applies TST principles to [[enzyme catalysis]]:

$$k_{\text{cat}} = \frac{k_B T}{h} e^{-\Delta G^{\ddagger} / k_B T}$$

Where $\Delta G^{\ddagger}$ is the [[free energy of activation]] for the [[rate-limiting step]].

### Solution Reactions

For reactions in solution, the [[solvent reorganization energy]] contributes to the activation barrier:

$$\Delta G^{\ddagger} = \Delta G_0^{\ddagger} + \lambda_s$$

Where $\lambda_s$ is the [[solvent reorganization energy]].

### Surface Reactions

For [[heterogeneous catalysis]], TST can be modified to account for surface binding:

$$k_{\text{surface}} = \frac{k_B T}{h} \frac{Q^{\ddagger}}{Q_{\text{ads}}} e^{-\Delta E_{\text{ads}}^{\ddagger} / k_B T}$$

Where:
- $Q_{\text{ads}}$ is the partition function of the adsorbed reactants
- $\Delta E_{\text{ads}}^{\ddagger}$ is the activation energy relative to the adsorbed state

## Computational Implementation

Modern implementations of TST in [[computational chemistry]] involve:

1. **[[Potential energy surface exploration]]**: Identifying reactants, products, and transition states using [[quantum chemical methods]].

2. **[[Frequency calculations]]**: Computing vibrational frequencies to confirm transition states (one imaginary frequency) and calculate partition functions.

3. **[[Reaction path following]]**: Validating that the transition state connects the intended reactants and products using [[intrinsic reaction coordinate]] (IRC) calculations.

4. **[[Free energy calculations]]**: Computing free energy profiles along reaction coordinates using methods like [[umbrella sampling]] or [[metadynamics]].

5. **[[Rate constant evaluation]]**: Applying appropriate TST formulations to calculate reaction rates.

## Limitations and Recent Developments

### Limitations

1. **[[Breakdown at high energies]]**: Classical assumptions become invalid.
2. **[[Dynamical effects]]**: Recrossing and non-statistical behavior can be significant.
3. **[[Multiple reaction channels]]**: Simple TST may not capture complex mechanisms.
4. **[[Non-adiabatic reactions]]**: Reactions involving multiple electronic states require extensions.

### Recent Developments

1. **[[Ring polymer molecular dynamics]]** (RPMD): Incorporates quantum effects through imaginary-time path integrals.

2. **[[Ab initio molecular dynamics]]** (AIMD): Combines TST with on-the-fly electronic structure calculations.

3. **[[Machine learning transition state theory]]**: Uses [[machine learning]] to construct PESs and identify transition states.

4. **[[Transition path sampling]]** (TPS): Complementary approach that samples reactive trajectories without assuming a specific reaction coordinate.

5. **[[Mean first-passage time]]** (MFPT) approaches: Connect TST to broader stochastic descriptions of reaction kinetics.

## Historical Significance and Legacy

TST represents one of the most successful bridges between [[statistical mechanics]] and [[chemical kinetics]]. Its enduring legacy includes:

1. Providing a fundamental explanation for [[Arrhenius behavior]] in reaction rates
2. Establishing the connection between equilibrium properties and reaction dynamics
3. Serving as the foundation for advanced theoretical approaches to reaction rates
4. Guiding the interpretation of experimental kinetic measurements
5. Enabling computational prediction of reaction rates from first principles
