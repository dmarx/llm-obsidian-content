Neutral theory of [[molecular evolution]]


**ASSISTANT**

The **Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution**, proposed by [[Motoo Kimura]] in 1968, asserts that most evolutionary changes at the molecular level (such as changes in DNA, RNA, and proteins) are the result of random [[genetic drift]] of **neutral mutations**, rather than being driven by natural selection. A **neutral mutation** is a mutation that does not affect an organism's fitness — in other words, it neither increases nor decreases the organism's chances of survival or reproduction.

This theory contrasts with the classical Darwinian view, which emphasizes natural selection as the primary driver of evolutionary change, and proposes that the majority of [[molecular evolution]] occurs due to stochastic processes in populations, rather than direct adaptation to environmental pressures.

### Core Principles of the Neutral Theory

1. **Most Mutations are Neutral**: At the molecular level, most mutations are either neutral or nearly neutral with respect to fitness. For example, many changes in the third base of a codon (the so-called **wobble position**) do not change the amino acid it codes for and are thus often neutral.

2. **Genetic Drift Dominates**: Neutral mutations become fixed or lost in a population primarily due to **[[genetic drift]]**, a random process that affects allele frequencies, especially in small populations. The **probability of fixation** of a neutral mutation is inversely proportional to the population size:
   $$
   P_{\text{fixation}} = \frac{1}{2N}
   $$
   where \( N \) is the [[effective population size]]. The smaller the population, the more significant the impact of drift relative to selection.

3. **Substitution Rate**: The rate at which new neutral mutations are fixed in a population is approximately constant over time. This leads to a **molecular clock**, where the number of neutral mutations that accumulate between species can be used to estimate the time since they diverged:
   $$
   k = u
   $$
   where \( k \) is the rate of neutral substitutions per generation, and \( u \) is the mutation rate per generation. The neutral theory thus predicts that the **rate of [[molecular evolution]]** is independent of population size but depends on the mutation rate.

4. **Nearly Neutral Theory**: The original neutral theory was extended to include the concept of **nearly neutral mutations** by [[Tomoko Ohta]] in 1973. Nearly neutral mutations have very small fitness effects (either positive or negative) and may behave as neutral in small populations but may be subject to weak selection in larger populations. The nearly neutral theory explains how mutations with slight selective advantages or disadvantages can still drift to fixation or loss, depending on the population size and the magnitude of selection.

### Formalization of the Neutral Theory

The core of the neutral theory can be expressed using population genetics and **Markov chain models**. The key quantity of interest is the probability of fixation of a neutral allele. For a single copy of a new mutation in a diploid population of size \( N \), the probability of fixation is:

$$
P_{\text{fixation}} = \frac{1}{2N}
$$

Given the mutation rate \( u \), the number of new neutral mutations entering the population each generation is \( 2Nu \) (because there are \( 2N \) alleles in a diploid population). The **rate of substitution** of neutral mutations, which is the rate at which mutations become fixed in the population, is then:

$$
\text{Rate of neutral substitutions} = 2N \times u \times \frac{1}{2N} = u
$$

Thus, the rate of neutral substitution depends only on the mutation rate \( u \), not on population size \( N \), and the number of neutral substitutions that accumulate over time follows a **Poisson process** with rate \( u \). This forms the basis for using molecular clocks to estimate divergence times between species.

### Implications of the Neutral Theory

1. **Molecular Clock**: Since the neutral theory predicts that the rate of [[molecular evolution]] is constant over time, it provides a foundation for the concept of the **molecular clock**. By comparing the genetic differences between species, scientists can estimate the time since their last common ancestor, assuming a roughly constant mutation rate over time.

2. **Polymorphism vs. Divergence**: The neutral theory predicts a relationship between levels of genetic diversity within species (polymorphism) and the divergence between species. **Kimura’s formula** for the expected heterozygosity, or genetic diversity, in a population at equilibrium is:
   $$
   H = 4N_e u
   $$
   where \( N_e \) is the [[effective population size]] and \( u \) is the mutation rate. This relationship links genetic diversity within a population to the long-term mutation rate and population size.

   Additionally, **neutrality tests** like the **McDonald-Kreitman test** compare the ratio of polymorphism within species to divergence between species to detect deviations from neutrality, which could indicate natural selection.

3. **Selective Constraints**: According to the neutral theory, functional regions of the genome, like protein-coding genes or regulatory elements, are subject to **selective constraint**. Mutations in these regions are less likely to be neutral, as they often affect fitness. Thus, the neutral theory suggests that regions of the genome with lower mutation rates are likely to be under stronger purifying selection, while regions with high mutation rates may evolve neutrally.

### Challenges to the Neutral Theory

While the neutral theory provides a powerful framework for understanding [[molecular evolution]], it does not fully explain all observed patterns in genomic data. Some of the main challenges include:

1. **Positive Selection**: While the neutral theory assumes that most molecular changes are neutral, **positive selection** clearly plays a role in the evolution of some genes. For example, genes involved in immune response, reproduction, or adaptation to environmental changes often show signs of adaptive evolution.
   
2. **Linkage and Background Selection**: Non-neutral processes like **background selection** (where deleterious mutations are purged from linked regions of the genome) and **hitchhiking** (where neutral or nearly neutral mutations are swept to fixation alongside beneficial mutations) can distort the predictions of the neutral theory.

3. **Genomic Data and Selection Signals**: Genome-wide data have revealed that certain genomic regions show signatures of **adaptive evolution**, where positive selection drives the rapid fixation of beneficial mutations. Such data require extensions of the neutral theory to account for selection and other processes shaping the genome.

### Mathematical Models for Testing Neutrality

Several statistical and computational tools have been developed to test the neutral theory and detect deviations that suggest selection:

- **Tajima’s D**: Compares the number of segregating sites to the average number of nucleotide differences to detect deviations from neutrality.
  
- **Fu and Li’s D/F**: Tests whether the site frequency spectrum (SFS) of mutations matches the neutral expectation.
  
- **McDonald-Kreitman Test**: Compares the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions within and between species to test for the action of natural selection.

### Conclusion

The **Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution** provides a foundational framework for understanding how genetic variation arises and evolves in populations. While the theory emphasizes [[genetic drift]] and neutral mutations as key drivers of [[molecular evolution]], it acknowledges that natural selection plays a role in shaping specific parts of the genome. It remains central to evolutionary biology and molecular genetics, serving as a baseline against which signals of selection and other evolutionary forces can be measured.
