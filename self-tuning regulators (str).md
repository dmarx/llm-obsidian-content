### Self-Tuning Regulators (STR)

Self-Tuning Regulators (STR) are a type of [[adaptive control]] system that combines parameter estimation with control law design. The primary goal of STR is to automatically adjust the controller parameters in real-time to maintain optimal performance despite changes in the system dynamics.

### Key Components of STR

1. **System Identification**: The process of estimating the parameters of the system model in real-time.
2. **Control Law Design**: The process of designing the control law based on the estimated system parameters.
3. **Adaptation Mechanism**: The algorithm that updates the controller parameters based on the current system identification.

### Mathematical Formulation

#### System Model

Consider a discrete-time linear system described by:
$$
y(k) = \theta^T \phi(k) + \epsilon(k),
$$
where:
- \( y(k) \) is the system output at time step \( k \),
- \( \theta \) is the parameter vector to be estimated,
- \( \phi(k) \) is the regressor vector,
- \( \epsilon(k) \) is the modeling error or noise.

#### Parameter Estimation

The system parameters \( \theta \) are estimated using methods such as Recursive Least Squares (RLS) or the gradient method. For example, in the RLS method, the parameter update law is given by:
$$
\theta(k+1) = \theta(k) + L(k) \left( y(k) - \theta^T(k) \phi(k) \right),
$$
where \( L(k) \) is the gain matrix calculated as:
$$
L(k) = \frac{P(k) \phi(k)}{1 + \phi^T(k) P(k) \phi(k)},
$$
and \( P(k) \) is the covariance matrix updated by:
$$
P(k+1) = P(k) - \frac{P(k) \phi(k) \phi^T(k) P(k)}{1 + \phi^T(k) P(k) \phi(k)}.
$$

#### Control Law

The control law is designed based on the estimated parameters. For a system with transfer function:
$$
G(z) = \frac{B(z)}{A(z)},
$$
where \( A(z) \) and \( B(z) \) are polynomials in \( z \), the control objective can be to track a reference signal \( r(k) \). The control law can be designed using methods such as [[pole placement]] or optimal control.

### Self-Tuning Regulator Algorithm

1. **Initialization**: Initialize the parameter estimates \( \theta(0) \) and the covariance matrix \( P(0) \).

2. **Parameter Estimation**: At each time step \( k \):
   - Measure the system output \( y(k) \) and update the regressor vector \( \phi(k) \).
   - Update the parameter estimates \( \theta(k) \) using the chosen estimation method (e.g., RLS).

3. **Control Law Update**: Based on the updated parameter estimates \( \theta(k) \), update the control law to compute the control input \( u(k) \).

4. **Apply Control Input**: Apply the control input \( u(k) \) to the system.

5. **Repeat**: Repeat steps 2-4 for each time step.

### Example: STR for a First-Order System

Consider a first-order discrete-time system:
$$
y(k+1) = a y(k) + b u(k) + \epsilon(k),
$$
where \( a \) and \( b \) are unknown parameters.

#### Parameter Estimation

The regressor vector is \( \phi(k) = [y(k), u(k)]^T \), and the parameter vector to be estimated is \( \theta = [a, b]^T \). Using RLS, the parameter update law is:
$$
\theta(k+1) = \theta(k) + L(k) \left( y(k+1) - \theta^T(k) \phi(k) \right),
$$
where the gain matrix \( L(k) \) and the covariance matrix \( P(k) \) are updated as described above.

#### Control Law Design

Assume we want to achieve a setpoint tracking control where \( y(k) \) tracks a reference \( r(k) \). A simple proportional controller can be designed as:
$$
u(k) = K_p (r(k) - y(k)),
$$
where \( K_p \) is a proportional gain chosen based on the estimated parameters to ensure stability and desired performance.

### Advantages of STR

1. **Real-Time Adaptation**: STR continuously adjusts the controller parameters to adapt to changes in system dynamics.
2. **Robustness**: STR can handle system uncertainties and variations, providing robust performance.
3. **Simplicity**: The STR framework is straightforward to implement and understand, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.

### Applications

1. **Industrial Process Control**: STR is used to maintain optimal performance in chemical, pharmaceutical, and manufacturing processes.
2. **Aerospace**: Adaptive flight control systems use STR to handle varying flight conditions and system dynamics.
3. **Automotive**: Engine control systems use STR to adapt to different operating conditions and driver behaviors.

### Conclusion

Self-Tuning Regulators provide an effective and robust approach to [[adaptive control]] by combining real-time parameter estimation with control law design. This approach ensures optimal performance in the presence of system uncertainties and variations.
