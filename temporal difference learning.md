## Temporal Difference Learning

### Overview

Temporal Difference (TD) Learning is a fundamental approach in [[reinforcement learning]] (RL) that combines ideas from Monte Carlo methods and dynamic programming. It allows an agent to learn directly from raw experience without requiring a model of the environment. TD learning methods update value estimates based on the difference (temporal difference) between successive estimates.

### Key Concepts

1. **Value Function**: Estimates the expected cumulative reward.
2. **Temporal Difference (TD) Error**: The difference between the predicted value and the observed value.
3. **Bootstrapping**: Updating estimates based on other learned estimates.

### Types of Value Functions

1. **State Value Function (\(V(s)\))**: Estimates the expected return starting from state \(s\).
2. **Action-Value Function (\(Q(s, a)\))**: Estimates the expected return starting from state \(s\) and taking action \(a\).

### Temporal Difference Error

The TD error measures the discrepancy between the predicted value of the current state and the observed reward plus the value of the next state:

\[
\delta_t = R_{t+1} + \gamma V(s_{t+1}) - V(s_t)
\]

where:
- \(R_{t+1}\) is the reward received after transitioning from \(s_t\) to \(s_{t+1}\).
- \(\gamma\) is the discount factor.
- \(V(s_t)\) is the current estimate of the value of state \(s_t\).
- \(V(s_{t+1})\) is the current estimate of the value of the next state \(s_{t+1}\).

### TD(0) Algorithm

TD(0) is the simplest form of TD learning, updating the state value function after every transition.

#### Update Rule

For state value function \(V(s)\):

\[
V(s_t) \leftarrow V(s_t) + \alpha \left( R_{t+1} + \gamma V(s_{t+1}) - V(s_t) \right)
\]

where \(\alpha\) is the learning rate.

### TD Learning Algorithms

1. **TD(0)**
2. **SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action)**
3. **Q-Learning**

### 1. TD(0)

TD(0) updates the state value function based on the immediate reward and the estimated value of the next state.

#### TD(0) Algorithm Steps

1. **Initialization**: Initialize \(V(s)\) arbitrarily for all \(s \in S\).
2. **Loop for each episode**:
   - Initialize \(s\).
   - Loop for each step of the episode:
     - Take action \(a\) and observe reward \(R\) and next state \(s'\).
     - Update \(V(s)\):

       \[
       V(s) \leftarrow V(s) + \alpha \left( R + \gamma V(s') - V(s) \right)
       \]
     - Set \(s \leftarrow s'\).

### 2. SARSA

SARSA is an on-policy TD control algorithm that updates the action-value function based on the action actually taken by the policy.

#### SARSA Update Rule

\[
Q(s_t, a_t) \leftarrow Q(s_t, a_t) + \alpha \left( R_{t+1} + \gamma Q(s_{t+1}, a_{t+1}) - Q(s_t, a_t) \right)
\]

### 3. Q-Learning

Q-Learning is an off-policy TD control algorithm that aims to learn the optimal action-value function \(Q^*(s, a)\) by updating the action-value function based on the maximum reward possible from the next state.

#### Q-Learning Update Rule

\[
Q(s_t, a_t) \leftarrow Q(s_t, a_t) + \alpha \left( R_{t+1} + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s_{t+1}, a') - Q(s_t, a_t) \right)
\]

### Example: TD(0) Algorithm in Python

```python
import numpy as np
import gym

env = gym.make('FrozenLake-v0')
V = np.zeros(env.observation_space.n)
alpha = 0.1
gamma = 0.99

def choose_action(state):
    return env.action_space.sample()

for episode in range(1000):
    state = env.reset()
    done = False
    while not done:
        action = choose_action(state)
        next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
        V[state] = V[state] + alpha * (reward + gamma * V[next_state] - V[state])
        state = next_state

print("Trained State Value Function:")
print(V)
```

### Example: SARSA Algorithm in Python

```python
import numpy as np
import gym

env = gym.make('FrozenLake-v0')
Q = np.zeros((env.observation_space.n, env.action_space.n))
alpha = 0.1
gamma = 0.99
epsilon = 0.1

def choose_action(state):
    if np.random.rand() < epsilon:
        return env.action_space.sample()
    else:
        return np.argmax(Q[state])

for episode in range(1000):
    state = env.reset()
    action = choose_action(state)
    done = False
    while not done:
        next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
        next_action = choose_action(next_state)
        Q[state, action] = Q[state, action] + alpha * (reward + gamma * Q[next_state, next_action] - Q[state, action])
        state = next_state
        action = next_action

print("Trained Q-Table using SARSA:")
print(Q)
```

### Example: Q-Learning Algorithm in Python

```python
import numpy as np
import gym

env = gym.make('FrozenLake-v0')
Q = np.zeros((env.observation_space.n, env.action_space.n))
alpha = 0.1
gamma = 0.99
epsilon = 0.1

def choose_action(state):
    if np.random.rand() < epsilon:
        return env.action_space.sample()
    else:
        return np.argmax(Q[state])

for episode in range(1000):
    state = env.reset()
    done = False
    while not done:
        action = choose_action(state)
        next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
        Q[state, action] = Q[state, action] + alpha * (reward + gamma * np.max(Q[next_state]) - Q[state, action])
        state = next_state

print("Trained Q-Table using Q-Learning:")
print(Q)
```

### Applications of TD Learning

1. **Game Playing**: Learning strategies for board games and video games.
2. **Robotics**: Learning control policies for navigation and manipulation tasks.
3. **Finance**: Optimizing trading strategies and portfolio management.
4. **Healthcare**: Personalizing treatment plans and optimizing drug discovery.
5. **Recommendation Systems**: Enhancing user recommendations and content personalization.

### Conclusion

Temporal Difference (TD) Learning is a powerful [[reinforcement learning]] approach that combines ideas from Monte Carlo methods and dynamic programming. TD methods, such as TD(0), SARSA, and Q-Learning, allow agents to learn directly from interactions with the environment, updating value estimates based on observed rewards and predicted future values. These methods are fundamental to many RL applications and provide a solid foundation for developing efficient and effective learning algorithms.
