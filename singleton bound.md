### Singleton Bound

The Singleton Bound is a fundamental result in [[coding theory]] that provides an upper limit on the size of a block code given its length, dimension, and minimum distance. It is named after Richard C. Singleton, who formulated the bound in 1964.

#### Definition

For a block code of length \(n\), dimension \(k\), and minimum distance \(d\) over a finite alphabet with \(q\) symbols, the Singleton Bound is given by:
$$ d \leq n - k + 1. $$

#### Interpretation

- **Block Length \(n\)**: The number of symbols in each codeword.
- **Dimension \(k\)**: The number of information symbols in each codeword, representing the number of independent messages the code can encode.
- **Minimum Distance \(d\)**: The smallest Hamming distance between any two distinct codewords, determining the code's error-detecting and error-correcting capability.

#### Proof Outline

The Singleton Bound can be derived by considering the properties of a block code and the Hamming distance between codewords:

1. **Codewords as Vectors**:
   - Consider a code \(C\) with codewords of length \(n\) over an alphabet with \(q\) symbols. The code can be seen as a subspace of \(\mathbb{F}_q^n\), where \(\mathbb{F}_q\) is the finite field with \(q\) elements.

2. **Distinct Codewords**:
   - Each codeword can be represented as a vector \(\mathbf{c} = (c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n)\) in \(\mathbb{F}_q^n\). The total number of codewords in \(C\) is \(q^k\), since the dimension of the code is \(k\).

3. **Minimum Distance Constraint**:
   - The minimum distance \(d\) implies that any two distinct codewords differ in at least \(d\) positions. To ensure this, each codeword must be distinct in at least \(d-1\) positions from all other codewords.

4. **Redundancy and Information Symbols**:
   - If we remove \(d-1\) symbols from each codeword, the remaining \(n-(d-1)\) symbols must still uniquely identify each codeword, as any two distinct codewords will still differ in at least one of the remaining positions.

5. **Maximum Number of Codewords**:
   - The maximum number of distinct codewords that can be formed by \(n-(d-1)\) symbols is \(q^{n-(d-1)}\). However, since our code \(C\) must be able to represent \(q^k\) distinct messages, we have:
     $$ q^k \leq q^{n-(d-1)}. $$

6. **Deriving the Bound**:
   - Taking the logarithm base \(q\) on both sides, we get:
     $$ k \leq n - (d-1). $$
   - Rearranging this, we obtain the Singleton Bound:
     $$ d \leq n - k + 1. $$

#### Implications

1. **Code Rate**:
   - The code rate \(R\) of a block code is defined as the ratio of the number of information symbols to the total number of symbols:
     $$ R = \frac{k}{n}. $$
   - The Singleton Bound indicates that there is a trade-off between the code rate and the error-correcting capability. Increasing the minimum distance \(d\) generally requires decreasing the code rate.

2. **MDS Codes**:
   - Codes that achieve the Singleton Bound with equality are called Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes. For an MDS code, the minimum distance is exactly \(d = n - k + 1\).
   - Examples of MDS codes include [[Reed-Solomon Codes]] and [[Extended Hamming Codes]].

3. **Error Detection and Correction**:
   - The minimum distance \(d\) of a code determines its error-detecting and error-correcting capabilities:
     - A code can detect up to \(d-1\) errors.
     - A code can correct up to \(\left\lfloor \frac{d-1}{2} \right\rfloor\) errors.

4. **Bound Tightness**:
   - While the Singleton Bound provides a theoretical upper limit, not all codes can achieve this bound. Codes that do not meet the Singleton Bound have a minimum distance \(d\) strictly less than \(n - k + 1\).

In summary, the Singleton Bound is a crucial result in [[coding theory]] that limits the parameters of block codes. It establishes a fundamental trade-off between the length, dimension, and minimum distance of a code, guiding the design and evaluation of error-correcting codes. Codes that meet the Singleton Bound are optimal in terms of their error-correcting capability for a given length and dimension.
