Wright-Fisher Model


**ASSISTANT**

The **Wright-Fisher model** is a foundational model in population genetics that describes the changes in allele frequencies within a population across generations due to [[genetic drift]], mutation, and selection. It was independently developed by [[Sewall Wright]] and [[Ronald Fisher]] in the 1930s and 1940s. The model is widely used to study the stochastic processes that govern the evolution of populations, such as the fixation or loss of alleles due to random sampling of individuals between generations.

### Key Assumptions of the Wright-Fisher Model

1. **Discrete Generations**: The population consists of discrete, non-overlapping generations. Each generation is replaced entirely by offspring from the previous generation.
   
2. **Constant Population Size**: The population size \( N \) is constant from one generation to the next. This is crucial because the strength of [[genetic drift]] (random fluctuations in allele frequencies) is inversely related to the population size.

3. **Random Mating**: Individuals mate randomly, meaning that every individual has an equal chance of contributing offspring to the next generation.

4. **Diploid Organisms**: In diploid organisms, each individual carries two copies of each gene (alleles). Allele frequencies are modeled as the proportion of alleles in the gene pool rather than the proportion of individuals.

5. **No Migration, Mutation, or Selection (in the simplest version)**: In the basic Wright-Fisher model, the only force acting on allele frequencies is **[[genetic drift]]**. However, extensions of the model incorporate **mutation**, **selection**, and **migration**.

6. **Binomial Sampling**: The number of copies of each allele in the next generation is determined by random binomial sampling from the current generationâ€™s gene pool. This introduces stochasticity into the model and allows for drift.

### Dynamics of the Wright-Fisher Model

Suppose we have a population of size \( N \), and we are interested in the frequency of two alleles, \( A \) and \( a \), at a particular locus. Let \( p_t \) be the frequency of allele \( A \) in generation \( t \), and \( q_t = 1 - p_t \) be the frequency of allele \( a \).

#### 1. **Genetic Drift**
Genetic drift describes the random fluctuations in allele frequencies that occur due to the finite population size. In each generation, the number of copies of allele \( A \) passed to the next generation follows a **binomial distribution** because each of the \( 2N \) alleles (for a diploid population) is independently sampled with probability \( p_t \) of being allele \( A \). Thus, the number of alleles \( A \) in the next generation follows:
$$
X_{t+1} \sim \text{Binomial}(2N, p_t)
$$
where \( X_{t+1} \) is the number of \( A \) alleles in generation \( t+1 \). The frequency of allele \( A \) in the next generation is:
$$
p_{t+1} = \frac{X_{t+1}}{2N}
$$
This binomial sampling introduces randomness into allele frequency changes, and the smaller the population size \( N \), the stronger the effect of drift.

#### 2. **Fixation and Loss**
Over time, [[genetic drift]] causes allele frequencies to fluctuate randomly. Eventually, one of two outcomes occurs:
- **Fixation**: Allele \( A \) reaches a frequency of 1, meaning it becomes fixed in the population.
- **Loss**: Allele \( A \) is lost, meaning its frequency reaches 0, and allele \( a \) becomes fixed.

The **probability of fixation** of a neutral allele \( A \) is equal to its initial frequency in the population. If allele \( A \) starts with frequency \( p_0 \), then the probability of allele \( A \) becoming fixed in the population is:
$$
P_{\text{fix}}(A) = p_0
$$
For a newly arising mutation, where \( p_0 = \frac{1}{2N} \) (since there is only one copy of the mutant allele in a diploid population), the probability of fixation is very small in large populations.

The **expected time to fixation or loss** of a neutral allele depends on the population size. For a neutral allele, the expected time to fixation is approximately:
$$
T_{\text{fix}} \approx 4N \text{ generations}
$$
This time increases with population size because [[genetic drift]] is weaker in larger populations.

### Wright-Fisher Model with Mutation and Selection

While the basic Wright-Fisher model assumes no mutation or selection, these forces can be incorporated to make the model more biologically realistic.

#### 1. **Mutation**
Mutation introduces new alleles into the population. Suppose the mutation rate from allele \( A \) to allele \( a \) is \( \mu \) and from \( a \) to \( A \) is \( \nu \). The Wright-Fisher model with mutation can be written as:
$$
p_{t+1} = (1 - \mu)p_t + \nu(1 - p_t)
$$
Mutation reduces the likelihood of fixation by continuously introducing new variants, and in the long term, the population will reach an equilibrium where both alleles are maintained.

#### 2. **Selection**
Selection favors certain alleles over others. If allele \( A \) has a selective advantage over allele \( a \), then individuals carrying \( A \) will have higher reproductive success. Let \( s \) be the selection coefficient, with \( s > 0 \) indicating a selective advantage for \( A \).

The probability of an individual carrying allele \( A \) contributing to the next generation is \( 1 + s \), while the probability for allele \( a \) is \( 1 \). In this case, the Wright-Fisher model with selection modifies the probability of choosing an allele based on fitness:
$$
p_{t+1} = \frac{p_t(1 + s)}{p_t(1 + s) + (1 - p_t)}
$$
Selection tends to drive the favored allele to fixation more quickly than drift alone.

### Mathematical Properties of the Wright-Fisher Model

1. **Variance in Allele Frequencies**: The variance in allele frequencies from one generation to the next due to drift is:
$$
\text{Var}(p_{t+1}) = \frac{p_t(1 - p_t)}{2N}
$$
This variance is inversely proportional to the population size, meaning that smaller populations experience more dramatic changes in allele frequencies due to drift.

2. **Probability of Fixation for Neutral Alleles**: The probability of fixation of a neutral allele is given by its initial frequency, as mentioned above:
$$
P_{\text{fix}} = p_0
$$
For a newly introduced mutation, this is \( 1/(2N) \).

3. **Coalescent Theory**: The Wright-Fisher model can be analyzed in a retrospective way using **coalescent theory**, which traces the ancestry of gene copies backward in time. In this framework, the [[effective population size]] \( N_e \) determines how quickly lineages coalesce (or merge) back to a common ancestor. In a neutral Wright-Fisher population, the expected time for two alleles to coalesce is \( 2N_e \) generations.

### Wright-Fisher vs. Moran Model

The Wright-Fisher model is often compared to the **Moran model**, which also describes [[genetic drift]] but with overlapping generations. The key differences between these models are:
1. **Generations**: In the Wright-Fisher model, reproduction occurs in discrete, non-overlapping generations, while the Moran model has continuous, overlapping generations where individuals reproduce and die one at a time.
2. **Time to Fixation**: Alleles tend to reach fixation more slowly in the Wright-Fisher model compared to the Moran model for the same population size, but the qualitative dynamics of [[genetic drift]] are similar.

### Applications of the Wright-Fisher Model

1. **Population Genetics**: The Wright-Fisher model is fundamental in understanding [[genetic drift]], allele fixation, and loss in populations of varying sizes.
   
2. **Evolutionary Dynamics**: It helps in modeling the effect of mutation, selection, and drift on evolutionary change, particularly in finite populations.

3. **Molecular Evolution**: The Wright-Fisher model is used in the context of **neutral theory**, where most genetic changes are due to drift rather than selection. This forms the basis for understanding how [[molecular evolution]] occurs in populations of different sizes.

4. **Conservation Biology**: The Wright-Fisher model is often applied in conservation genetics to predict the effects of small population sizes on genetic diversity and the risk of inbreeding depression.

### Conclusion

The **Wright-Fisher model** is a cornerstone of population genetics, offering a stochastic framework to study [[genetic drift]] and the random changes in allele frequencies over generations. Its simple structure, combined with extensions for mutation and selection, makes it a versatile model for studying evolution in finite populations. By capturing the randomness of evolutionary processes, the Wright-Fisher model is crucial for understanding how genetic variation is maintained or lost in populations, and it plays a central role in both theoretical and applied evolutionary biology.
