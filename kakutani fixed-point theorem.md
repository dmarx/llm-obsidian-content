Kakutani Fixed-Point Theorem


**ASSISTANT**

### Kakutani Fixed-Point Theorem

The Kakutani Fixed-Point Theorem is a generalization of the Brouwer Fixed-Point Theorem to set-valued maps. It plays a crucial role in economics, game theory, and mathematical analysis, particularly in proving the existence of equilibria in systems with multiple possible outcomes.

### Statement of the Theorem

#### Theorem:

Let \( X \) be a non-empty, compact, and convex subset of a finite-dimensional vector space \( \mathbb{R}^n \), and let \( F: X \to 2^X \) be a set-valued map satisfying the following conditions:

1. **Non-emptiness**: \( F(x) \) is non-empty for all \( x \in X \).
2. **Convexity**: \( F(x) \) is convex for all \( x \in X \).
3. **Upper Semicontinuity**: The graph of \( F \) is closed, i.e., \( F \) is upper semicontinuous.

Then there exists at least one point \( x^* \in X \) such that:
$$
x^* \in F(x^*)
$$

### Key Concepts and Definitions

#### Upper Semicontinuity

A set-valued map \( F: X \to 2^Y \) is upper semicontinuous at \( x_0 \in X \) if for every open set \( V \) containing \( F(x_0) \), there exists a neighborhood \( U \) of \( x_0 \) such that \( F(x) \subseteq V \) for all \( x \in U \). Formally, \( F \) is upper semicontinuous if:
$$
\limsup_{x \to x_0} F(x) \subseteq F(x_0).
$$

#### Convexity

A set \( A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n \) is convex if, for any \( x, y \in A \) and any \( \lambda \in [0, 1] \), the point \( \lambda x + (1 - \lambda) y \in A \). A set-valued map \( F \) is convex-valued if \( F(x) \) is a convex set for all \( x \in X \).

### Proof Outline

1. **Approximation by Finite Subsets**: Construct a sequence of finite approximations to the map \( F \) using finite subsets of \( X \).
2. **Fixed-Point for Finite Approximations**: Apply a combinatorial fixed-point theorem, such as the Knaster-Kuratowski-Mazurkiewicz (KKM) theorem, to each finite approximation to find an approximate fixed point.
3. **Limit Point**: Show that the limit of these approximate fixed points is a fixed point of the original map \( F \), using the compactness and upper semicontinuity properties.

### Applications

#### Nash Equilibrium in Game Theory

The Kakutani Fixed-Point Theorem is used to prove the existence of Nash equilibria in games where players have mixed strategies. Each player's best response is a set-valued map, and the theorem ensures the existence of a fixed point where each player's strategy is optimal given the others.

#### General Equilibrium in Economics

In general equilibrium theory, the theorem guarantees the existence of a price vector at which supply equals demand in all markets. The excess demand function is a set-valued map, and Kakutani's theorem ensures the existence of an equilibrium.

#### Differential Inclusions

In the study of [[differential inclusions]], the theorem helps in proving the existence of solutions where the right-hand side of the differential equation is a set-valued map.

### Example: Nash Equilibrium

Consider a finite game with \( n \) players, where each player \( i \) has a strategy set \( S_i \). Let \( \Delta(S_i) \) denote the set of mixed strategies (probability distributions over \( S_i \)). Define the best response correspondence \( B_i \) for player \( i \) as:
$$
B_i(\sigma_{-i}) = \{ \sigma_i \in \Delta(S_i) \mid \sigma_i \text{ maximizes player } i \text{â€™s expected payoff given } \sigma_{-i} \}.
$$
The product of these correspondences forms a set-valued map \( B: \Delta(S_1) \times \cdots \times \Delta(S_n) \to 2^{\Delta(S_1) \times \cdots \times \Delta(S_n)} \). Each \( B_i \) is non-empty, convex-valued, and upper semicontinuous. By the Kakutani Fixed-Point Theorem, there exists a mixed strategy profile \( (\sigma_1^*, \ldots, \sigma_n^*) \) such that:
$$
(\sigma_1^*, \ldots, \sigma_n^*) \in B(\sigma_1^*, \ldots, \sigma_n^*),
$$
which is a Nash equilibrium.

### Conclusion

The Kakutani Fixed-Point Theorem extends classical fixed-point results to set-valued maps, ensuring the existence of fixed points under conditions of non-emptiness, convexity, and upper semicontinuity. This theorem has profound implications in economics, game theory, and mathematical analysis, providing foundational support for the existence of equilibria in complex systems.
