## Formal Definition of an "Agent" in Reinforcement Learning

### Overview

In the context of reinforcement learning (RL), an **agent** is an entity that interacts with an environment to achieve a goal by taking actions based on observations and receiving rewards. The agent's objective is to maximize the cumulative reward over time through a policy that maps states to actions.

### Formal Definition

An agent in RL can be formally defined by the following components:

1. **State Space (\(S\))**
2. **Action Space (\(A\))**
3. **Policy (\(\pi\))**
4. **Reward Function (\(R\))**
5. **Learning Algorithm**

### Components

#### 1. State Space (\(S\))

The state space \(S\) is a set of all possible states \(s \in S\) that describe the environment at any given time. A state \(s_t \in S\) at time \(t\) captures all the information the agent needs to make a decision.

- Example: In a grid-world environment, a state \(s_t\) might represent the agent's position on the grid.

#### 2. Action Space (\(A\))

The action space \(A\) is a set of all possible actions \(a \in A\) that the agent can take. An action \(a_t \in A\) at time \(t\) is chosen by the agent based on its current state \(s_t\).

- Example: In a grid-world environment, the action space might include \{up, down, left, right\}.

#### 3. Policy (\(\pi\))

The policy \(\pi\) is a mapping from states to actions, defining the agent's behavior. It can be deterministic or stochastic.

- **Deterministic Policy**: \(\pi: S \to A\)
  - Example: \(\pi(s_t) = a_t\), where \(a_t\) is the action taken in state \(s_t\).
  
- **Stochastic Policy**: \(\pi: S \times A \to [0, 1]\)
  - Example: \(\pi(a_t | s_t)\) is the probability of taking action \(a_t\) given state \(s_t\).

#### 4. Reward Function (\(R\))

The reward function \(R: S \times A \times S \to \mathbb{R}\) defines the immediate reward \(r_t \in \mathbb{R}\) received after transitioning from state \(s_t\) to state \(s_{t+1}\) due to action \(a_t\).

- Example: In a grid-world environment, the reward might be \(+1\) for reaching the goal state and \(0\) otherwise.

#### 5. Learning Algorithm

The learning algorithm is the method used by the agent to improve its policy \(\pi\) based on experiences. Common learning algorithms include Q-learning, SARSA, and policy gradient methods.

- **Q-Learning**: An off-policy algorithm that updates the action-value function \(Q(s, a)\) to learn the optimal policy.
- **SARSA**: An on-policy algorithm that updates the action-value function based on the action actually taken.
- **Policy Gradient Methods**: Optimize the policy directly by maximizing the expected cumulative reward.

### Formal Representation of an Agent

An agent can be represented formally as a tuple \((S, A, \pi, R, \text{Algorithm})\), where:

- \(S\) is the state space.
- \(A\) is the action space.
- \(\pi\) is the policy.
- \(R\) is the reward function.
- \(\text{Algorithm}\) is the learning algorithm used to optimize the policy.

### Example: Formal Representation in Grid-World

Consider an agent navigating a 5x5 grid-world with the goal of reaching a specific cell.

- **State Space (\(S\))**: The set of all possible positions on the grid, \(S = \{(x, y) | x, y \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\}\).
- **Action Space (\(A\))**: The set of possible movements, \(A = \{\text{up}, \text{down}, \text{left}, \text{right}\}\).
- **Policy (\(\pi\))**: A mapping from grid positions to movements.
  - Example deterministic policy: \(\pi((2, 3)) = \text{right}\).
  - Example stochastic policy: \(\pi(\text{right} | (2, 3)) = 0.8\), \(\pi(\text{up} | (2, 3)) = 0.2\).
- **Reward Function (\(R\))**: A function defining rewards for state transitions.
  - Example: \(R((x, y), \text{action}, (x', y')) = 1\) if \((x', y')\) is the goal state, otherwise \(0\).
- **Learning Algorithm**: Q-learning with learning rate \(\alpha\) and discount factor \(\gamma\).

### Conclusion

An agent in reinforcement learning is a well-defined entity characterized by its state space, action space, policy, reward function, and learning algorithm. These components work together to enable the agent to interact with the environment, learn from experiences, and optimize its behavior to maximize cumulative rewards. Formalizing the definition of an agent helps in designing and understanding RL systems, ensuring clarity in the development and analysis of learning algorithms.
