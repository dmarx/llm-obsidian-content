### Front-Door Criterion

The front-door criterion is another important concept in causal inference within the framework of Structural Causal Models (SCMs). It provides a method for identifying and estimating causal effects even when back-door adjustment is not feasible due to unobserved confounders. This criterion involves using an intermediate variable (mediator) that lies on the causal path between the treatment and the outcome.

#### 1. **Conceptual Overview**

- **Mediation**: In the context of causal inference, a mediator is an intermediate variable that transmits the causal effect of the treatment to the outcome.
- **Front-Door Path**: A path that goes through an intermediate variable \(Z\) between the treatment \(X\) and the outcome \(Y\).

#### 2. **Definition of the Front-Door Criterion**

A set of variables \(Z\) satisfies the front-door criterion relative to the causal effect of \(X\) on \(Y\) if:

1. **Mediation**: \(Z\) is on the causal path from \(X\) to \(Y\) (i.e., \(X \rightarrow Z \rightarrow Y\)).
2. **Blocking Back-Door Paths from \(X\) to \(Z\)**: There are no back-door paths from \(X\) to \(Z\), or they are blocked by \(Z\).
3. **Blocking Back-Door Paths from \(Z\) to \(Y\)**: All back-door paths from \(Z\) to \(Y\) are blocked by \(X\).

By adjusting for \(Z\), one can estimate the causal effect of \(X\) on \(Y\) even in the presence of unobserved confounders affecting the direct path from \(X\) to \(Y\).

#### 3. **Using the Front-Door Criterion**

- **Step 1: Identify the Causal DAG**: Construct a directed acyclic graph (DAG) representing the causal relationships among the variables.
- **Step 2: Determine Front-Door Paths**: Identify the paths from \(X\) to \(Y\) through the mediator \(Z\).
- **Step 3: Verify Front-Door Criterion**: Ensure that \(Z\) satisfies the conditions of the front-door criterion.

#### 4. **Formal Adjustment Using Front-Door Criterion**

If a set of variables \(Z\) satisfies the front-door criterion for the causal effect of \(X\) on \(Y\), the causal effect can be estimated as follows:

1. **Estimate the effect of \(X\) on \(Z\)**:
   \[
   P(Z \mid do(X)) = P(Z \mid X)
   \]
   Here, since there are no back-door paths from \(X\) to \(Z\), \(P(Z \mid do(X))\) equals the observed conditional probability \(P(Z \mid X)\).

2. **Estimate the effect of \(Z\) on \(Y\)**, controlling for \(X\):
   \[
   P(Y \mid do(Z)) = \sum_{x} P(Y \mid X=x, Z) P(X=x)
   \]

3. **Combine these estimates to find \(P(Y \mid do(X))\)**:
   \[
   P(Y \mid do(X)) = \sum_{z} P(Y \mid do(Z=z)) P(Z=z \mid do(X))
   \]

#### 5. **Example Application**

Consider a scenario where we want to estimate the causal effect of a new teaching method (\(X\)) on student performance (\(Y\)), with class engagement (\(Z\)) as a mediator:

- **Causal DAG**:
  \[
  \begin{array}{c}
  X \rightarrow Z \rightarrow Y \\
  \text{Teaching Method} \rightarrow \text{Class Engagement} \rightarrow \text{Student Performance}
  \end{array}
  \]
- **Assumptions**:
  - The teaching method affects student performance through class engagement.
  - There are no unobserved confounders affecting both the teaching method and class engagement.
  - There are no unobserved confounders affecting both class engagement and student performance once we control for the teaching method.

- **Estimation**:
  - **Step 1**: Estimate the effect of teaching method (\(X\)) on class engagement (\(Z\)):
    \[
    P(Z \mid do(X)) = P(Z \mid X)
    \]

  - **Step 2**: Estimate the effect of class engagement (\(Z\)) on student performance (\(Y\)), controlling for the teaching method (\(X\)):
    \[
    P(Y \mid do(Z)) = \sum_{x} P(Y \mid X=x, Z) P(X=x)
    \]

  - **Step 3**: Combine these estimates to find \(P(Y \mid do(X))\):
    \[
    P(Y \mid do(X)) = \sum_{z} P(Y \mid do(Z=z)) P(Z=z \mid do(X))
    \]

#### 6. **Advantages and Limitations**

- **Advantages**:
  - **Handles Unobserved Confounders**: Allows for causal inference even when there are unobserved confounders affecting the direct path from \(X\) to \(Y\).
  - **Mediation Analysis**: Provides insights into the mechanisms through which the causal effect operates.

- **Limitations**:
  - **Assumption Validity**: The front-door criterion relies on the correctness of the assumed DAG and the satisfaction of its conditions.
  - **Data Requirements**: Requires data on the mediator \(Z\) and sufficient variation in \(X\) and \(Z\).

#### 7. **Philosophical Considerations**

- **Interventionism**: The front-door criterion aligns with interventionist theories of causation, where causal relationships are understood in terms of the effects of interventions.
- **Mediation**: Emphasizes the importance of understanding intermediate processes and mechanisms in causal analysis.

### Conclusion

The front-door criterion is a powerful tool in causal inference, enabling the estimation of causal effects through the use of mediating variables. By leveraging intermediate variables that satisfy specific conditions, researchers can overcome challenges posed by unobserved confounders and gain deeper insights into causal mechanisms. Understanding and applying the front-door criterion enhances the rigor and scope of causal analysis in fields such as epidemiology, social sciences, and economics.
