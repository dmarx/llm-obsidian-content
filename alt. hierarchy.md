**USER**

[[alt.* Hierarchy]]


**ASSISTANT**

The **`alt.* hierarchy`** is a category of [[newsgroups]] on [[Usenet]] that was designed to allow users more freedom to create and manage discussion groups without the need for formal approval processes, which were required in other hierarchies (such as `comp.*`, `rec.*`, or `sci.*`). The `alt.*` hierarchy is notable for being both informal and highly decentralized, which led to the creation of a wide variety of [[newsgroups]] covering almost any conceivable topic, including controversial or niche interests.

### Key Features of the `alt.*` Hierarchy

1. **Decentralized Creation Process:**
   - Unlike other Usenet hierarchies, where new [[newsgroups]] had to be proposed and voted on by the Usenet community, the `alt.*` hierarchy allowed new groups to be created with relative ease, usually by simply requesting a server administrator to add it. This encouraged the rapid growth of new groups on topics that might not have been approved in the more regulated parts of Usenet.

2. **Informal and Niche Discussions:**
   - The lack of formal approval meant that `alt.*` [[newsgroups]] could cover any subject, leading to the creation of many niche, offbeat, or experimental groups. While some groups were dedicated to serious discussions, many were humorous, irreverent, or controversial, and some [[newsgroups]] even became notorious for hosting illegal or adult content.
   - Examples:
     - **`alt.music`** – Discussions about music, with various subgroups for specific genres or artists.
     - **`alt.humor`** – A popular group for sharing jokes and humorous content.
     - **`alt.religion.scientology`** – One of the more famous and controversial groups, dedicated to discussions and criticism of the Church of Scientology.
     - **`[[alt.sex]]`** – Contained various groups devoted to adult and sexual content.

3. **Wide Variety of Topics:**
   - The flexibility of the `alt.*` hierarchy meant that [[newsgroups]] could be created on just about anything. Popular groups could be devoted to hobbies, technical discussions, pop culture, conspiracy theories, or even pure nonsense.
   - Some `alt.*` groups had very specific purposes, like `alt.swedish.chef.bork.bork.bork`, which was a humorous group named after the Muppet character **Swedish Chef**, where discussions were often written in a playful style mimicking the character's speech.

4. **Moderated vs. Unmoderated Groups:**
   - Similar to other Usenet hierarchies, `alt.*` [[newsgroups]] could be either **moderated** or **unmoderated**. In practice, however, many `alt.*` groups were unmoderated, which contributed to a more freeform, chaotic environment.
   - Moderated groups, though rare in `alt.*`, required posts to be approved by a moderator before being published, which helped maintain focus in some groups with a higher signal-to-noise ratio.

### Creation of `alt.*` Groups
The process for creating an `alt.*` newsgroup was straightforward compared to other hierarchies. In essence, it required no formal proposal or vote; a group could be created simply by finding a system administrator willing to propagate the new group's name to their servers. This often meant that new groups appeared quickly and without much prior coordination, leading to a chaotic but creative expansion of topics.

### Cultural Impact of the `alt.* Hierarchy`

1. **Freedom and Anarchy:**
   - The `alt.*` hierarchy symbolized the **free speech** ethos of early internet culture. It became a place where people could create communities around any interest, no matter how obscure, controversial, or humorous. It is often seen as an early experiment in **decentralized community formation** on the internet.
   
2. **Notorious or Controversial Groups:**
   - Some `alt.*` groups gained notoriety due to the controversial nature of their discussions or content. For example, groups like **`[[alt.sex]]`** or **`alt.drugs`** hosted discussions on taboo topics, which sometimes led to legal concerns. 
   - **`alt.religion.scientology`** became one of the most famous and heavily trafficked [[newsgroups]] due to the fierce debate and criticism of the Church of Scientology, leading to conflicts that prefigured the later **Anonymous vs. Scientology** battles on the internet.

3. **Memes and Early Internet Humor:**
   - Many early internet memes and in-jokes originated in `alt.*` groups, including playful or satirical groups like **`alt.humor`**. These [[newsgroups]] became a place where early internet users experimented with humor, language, and community dynamics, creating a **meme culture** that would later flourish on platforms like Reddit and 4chan.

4. **Decline and Legacy:**
   - As with much of Usenet, the use of the `alt.*` hierarchy declined in the late 1990s and 2000s with the rise of web-based forums, social media, and modern content-sharing platforms. However, the creative, chaotic spirit of `alt.*` lives on in more contemporary internet cultures, particularly in online communities like Reddit, where user-generated content and niche interest groups thrive.

The open, anarchic nature of the `alt.*` hierarchy left an indelible mark on the early internet's **decentralized governance** and **community-driven** approach to content creation, paving the way for modern **peer-to-peer networks** and **online forums**.

### Examples of Popular `alt.*` Newsgroups:
- **`alt.humor`** – For jokes and humor.
- **`alt.fan.starwars`** – A discussion group for fans of **Star Wars**.
- **`alt.tv.simpsons`** – A group dedicated to discussing **The Simpsons** TV show.
- **`alt.binaries.*`** – Groups under the `alt.binaries` hierarchy were often used for sharing binary files (such as images, videos, or software), sometimes leading to the distribution of pirated or copyrighted material.
