affine varieties


**ASSISTANT**

In algebraic geometry, **affine varieties** are fundamental objects defined as the set of solutions to a system of polynomial equations over an algebraic field, typically within the context of an affine space. Here's a more detailed breakdown of affine varieties, including their definition, properties, and examples.

### Definition

An affine variety is the set of all points in $n$-dimensional affine space $\mathbb{A}^n(k)$ over a field $k$ (often $\mathbb{C}$ or $\mathbb{R}$) that satisfy a given set of polynomial equations. Formally, if $f_1, f_2, \ldots, f_m$ are polynomials in $k[x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n]$, then the affine variety $V$ they define is given by:

$$
V(f_1, f_2, \ldots, f_m) = \{\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{A}^n(k) \mid f_i(\mathbf{x}) = 0 \text{ for all } i\}.
$$

### Properties

1. **Zariski Topology**: Affine varieties are equipped with a topology known as the Zariski topology, where closed sets are defined by polynomial equations. This topology is coarser than the standard topologies used in real and complex analysis.

2. **Irreducible Components**: An affine variety may be decomposed into irreducible components, which are subvarieties that cannot themselves be expressed as the union of two non-trivial subvarieties. These components correspond to the minimal prime ideals of the [[ring]] of polynomials that vanish on the variety.

3. **Coordinate Ring**: The [[coordinate [[ring]]]] of an affine variety $V$ defined by polynomials $f_1, \ldots, f_m$ is the quotient [[ring]] $k[x_1, \ldots, x_n]/\langle f_1, \ldots, f_m \rangle$. This [[ring]] is crucial as it encodes much of the geometric information about the variety.

4. **Dimension and Singularities**: The dimension of an affine variety is a key geometric and algebraic invariant, indicating the "size" of the variety in some sense. Singular points on a variety are those where the variety fails to be locally flat (i.e., where the Jacobian matrix of the defining polynomials does not have full rank).

### Examples

1. **Lines and Planes in $\mathbb{A}^2$ and $\mathbb{A}^3$**: For example, the line defined by $x_1 - 2x_2 + 3 = 0$ in $\mathbb{A}^2(\mathbb{C})$.

2. **The Hyperbola**: Defined by $xy - 1 = 0$ in $\mathbb{A}^2$. This variety is non-singular as its defining polynomial is smooth.

3. **The Cubic Curve**: Given by $y^2 = x^3 - x$. This curve has a singularity at the origin $(0,0)$ if considered over fields that do not have characteristic 2.

4. **Normal Varieties**: A variety is normal if it is nonsingular in codimension 1. For example, the variety defined by $x^2 - y^2 - z^2 = 0$ in $\mathbb{A}^3$ is normal but has a singularity at the origin.

Affine varieties form the building blocks for more complex structures in algebraic geometry, such as [[Projective Varieties|projective varieties]] and [[Schemes|schemes]]. They serve as both a starting point for the theory and a rich source of examples illustrating deeper concepts like duality, dimension theory, and singularity analysis.
