### Quantization

Quantization is the process of mapping a continuous set of values (or a large discrete set of values) to a smaller, typically finite set of values. This concept appears across a range of fields, including signal processing, numerical methods, and quantum mechanics, but its specific formalization varies depending on the context. Below, we provide a detailed technical explanation of quantization and its major applications.

## 1. **Quantization in Signal Processing**
Quantization is a key step in digitizing analog signals, particularly in [[Analog-to-Digital Conversion|ADC]] processes. It introduces an error by approximating the true value of a signal with the closest representable value in the target set (usually integers corresponding to digital levels).

### Formal Definition
Given a continuous signal \( x(t) \), quantization maps it to a discrete signal \( \hat{x}(t) \) such that:
$$
\hat{x}(t) = Q(x(t))
$$
where \( Q: \mathbb{R} \to S \) is the quantization function, and \( S \subset \mathbb{R} \) is the discrete set of allowable values.

#### Uniform Quantization
In uniform quantization, the range of \( x(t) \) is divided into \( N \) equal intervals of width \( \Delta \). The quantized value is the midpoint of the interval containing \( x(t) \). Mathematically:
$$
Q(x) = \Delta \cdot \left\lfloor \frac{x}{\Delta} + \frac{1}{2} \right\rfloor
$$

#### Quantization Error
The difference between \( x(t) \) and \( \hat{x}(t) \) is the **quantization error**:
$$
e(t) = x(t) - \hat{x}(t)
$$
For uniform quantization of a sufficiently smooth and uniform signal, \( e(t) \) is often approximated as a uniformly distributed random variable.

## 2. **Quantization in Numerical Analysis**
In numerical methods, quantization arises due to rounding or truncation of numbers for storage or computation. This is crucial for finite-precision arithmetic in computers.

### Floating-Point Quantization
Let \( x \in \mathbb{R} \). The representation in a floating-point system with base \( \beta \), precision \( p \), and exponent range \([e_{\text{min}}, e_{\text{max}}]\) involves:
$$
x = (-1)^s \cdot m \cdot \beta^e
$$
where:
- \( s \in \{0, 1\} \) is the sign bit,
- \( m \) (mantissa) satisfies \( 1 \leq m < \beta \),
- \( e \) (exponent) is within the allowable range.

The quantization error depends on the precision \( p \) and is bounded by:
$$
|x - \hat{x}| \leq \frac{\beta^{1-p}}{2}
$$

## 3. **Quantization in Quantum Mechanics**
In quantum mechanics, quantization refers to the process of transitioning from classical mechanics to a quantum description of physical systems. This involves associating physical observables with operators on a Hilbert space and imposing quantization rules.

### Canonical Quantization
The classical phase space is defined by the canonical variables \( (q, p) \), where \( q \) represents position and \( p \) momentum. Quantization replaces these variables with operators \( \hat{q} \) and \( \hat{p} \), satisfying the canonical commutation relation:
$$
[\hat{q}, \hat{p}] = i\hbar
$$
where \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant.

### Path Integral Quantization
Path integral quantization reformulates quantum mechanics in terms of summing over histories. The probability amplitude for a transition is given by:
$$
\int \exp\left( \frac{i}{\hbar} S[x(t)] \right) \mathcal{D}x
$$
where \( S[x(t)] \) is the action functional.

## 4. **Quantization in Machine Learning**
Quantization is used to compress models by reducing the precision of parameters and activations while maintaining accuracy. For example, neural network weights may be quantized from 32-bit floats to 8-bit integers.

### Formalization
For a weight \( w \in \mathbb{R} \), let \( q \in \{-2^{n-1}, \ldots, 2^{n-1}-1\} \) represent a quantized value. The relationship is:
$$
q = \text{round}\left( \frac{w - w_{\text{min}}}{\Delta} \right), \quad \Delta = \frac{w_{\text{max}} - w_{\text{min}}}{2^n - 1}
$$
The original weight can be approximately reconstructed as:
$$
\hat{w} = q \cdot \Delta + w_{\text{min}}
$$

Quantization has far-reaching implications in diverse fields, with its specific realization tailored to the needs of the application. The trade-off between precision and efficiency is a central concern in any implementation.
