Schramm–Loewner evolution


**ASSISTANT**

The Schramm–Loewner Evolution (SLE) is a family of random fractal curves that are important in the study of two-dimensional statistical mechanics and conformal field theory. Introduced by Oded Schramm in 1999, SLE describes the scaling limits of various models in statistical mechanics, such as the percolation model, the Ising model, and the self-avoiding walk.

## Definition of SLE

SLE is defined through the Loewner differential equation, driven by a one-dimensional Brownian motion. Consider the upper half-plane $\mathbb{H} = \{ z \in \mathbb{C} : \Im(z) > 0 \}$ and the complex-valued Brownian motion $B_t$ with variance parameter $\kappa$. The SLE$_\kappa$ curve is generated as follows:

1. **Loewner's Equation**: The evolution of a family of conformal maps $g_t: \mathbb{H} \setminus K_t \to \mathbb{H}$ is governed by the Loewner differential equation:

   $$ \frac{\partial g_t(z)}{\partial t} = \frac{2}{g_t(z) - W_t}, \quad g_0(z) = z, $$

   where $W_t$ is a continuous real-valued function, called the driving function.

2. **Driving Function**: For SLE, the driving function is chosen to be $W_t = \sqrt{\kappa} B_t$, where $B_t$ is a standard Brownian motion.

3. **Hull $K_t$**: At each time $t$, $K_t$ is the growing hull generated by the curve $\gamma(t)$. The conformal maps $g_t$ "remove" the hull $K_t$ from the upper half-plane, mapping $\mathbb{H} \setminus K_t$ back to $\mathbb{H}$.

## Properties of SLE

- **Fractality**: The SLE curves are fractal and their Hausdorff dimension is related to the parameter $\kappa$. Specifically, the dimension $d$ of the SLE$_\kappa$ curve is given by

  $$ d = 1 + \frac{\kappa}{8} \quad \text{for } \kappa \leq 8. $$

- **Phase Transition at $\kappa = 4$**: The behavior of SLE curves changes qualitatively at $\kappa = 4$. For $\kappa \leq 4$, the curves are simple (non-self-intersecting), while for $\kappa > 4$, the curves become self-intersecting.

- **Duality**: SLE exhibits a duality property: SLE$_\kappa$ in $\mathbb{H}$ with $\kappa \leq 4$ is the same as SLE$_{16/\kappa}$ in the complementary domain $\mathbb{H}^c$.

## Examples and Applications

- **SLE$_2$**: Describes the scaling limit of the loop-erased random walk.
- **SLE$_3$**: Corresponds to the scaling limit of the interface in the critical Ising model.
- **SLE$_6$**: Represents the scaling limit of the critical percolation interfaces.

## Mathematical Formalism

### Loewner's Equation

Consider a conformal map $g_t(z)$ from $\mathbb{H} \setminus K_t$ onto $\mathbb{H}$. The Loewner differential equation driven by the function $W_t$ is

$$ \frac{\partial g_t(z)}{\partial t} = \frac{2}{g_t(z) - W_t}, \quad g_0(z) = z. $$

For SLE$_\kappa$, the driving function is $W_t = \sqrt{\kappa} B_t$, where $B_t$ is a standard Brownian motion.

### Hulls and Curves

The hull $K_t$ is defined as the set of points $z \in \mathbb{H}$ that cannot be mapped to $\mathbb{H}$ by $g_s$ for any $s < t$. The curve $\gamma(t)$ represents the trace of the growing hull, i.e.,

$$ \gamma(t) = \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} g_t^{-1}(W_t + i\epsilon). $$

### Conformal Maps and SLE Trace

The conformal maps $g_t$ satisfy $g_t(z) \sim z + \frac{2t}{z} + O\left(\frac{1}{z^2}\right)$ as $z \to \infty$. The trace $\gamma(t)$ represents the physical realization of the SLE curve in the complex plane.

## Connection to Physical Models

SLE$_\kappa$ provides a universal description of interfaces in critical 2D statistical mechanics models. The exact value of $\kappa$ depends on the specific model and its critical behavior. The conformal invariance property of SLE makes it a powerful tool for studying the scaling limits of these models.

For further detailed study, you might refer to foundational papers and textbooks on SLE, such as:

- Lawler, Gregory F. "Conformally Invariant Processes in the Plane."
- Rohde, Steffen, and Oded Schramm. "Basic properties of SLE." 

The study of SLE has profound implications in both mathematics and physics, providing deep insights into the nature of critical phenomena and conformal invariance in two dimensions.
