stationary action principle


**ASSISTANT**

The **Stationary Action Principle**, also known as the **Principle of Least Action** or **Hamilton's Principle**, is a fundamental concept in classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, and field theory. It states that the actual path taken by a physical system between two configurations is the one for which the action is stationary (typically a minimum or a saddle point) with respect to small variations of the path.

### Action in Mechanics

In classical mechanics, the *action* $S$ is defined as the integral over time of a quantity called the *Lagrangian* $L$, which is a function that depends on the generalized coordinates $\mathbf{q}(t)$, their time derivatives $\dot{\mathbf{q}}(t)$, and possibly time $t$ itself. Mathematically, the action $S$ is given by:

$$
S[\mathbf{q}(t)] = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} L(\mathbf{q}(t), \dot{\mathbf{q}}(t), t) \, dt.
$$

The Lagrangian $L$ is typically the difference between the kinetic energy $T$ and the potential energy $V$ of the system:

$$
L(\mathbf{q}, \dot{\mathbf{q}}, t) = T(\mathbf{q}, \dot{\mathbf{q}}) - V(\mathbf{q}, t).
$$

### Principle of Stationary Action

The **Stationary Action Principle** asserts that the path $\mathbf{q}(t)$ taken by a system from an initial configuration at time $t_1$ to a final configuration at time $t_2$ is such that the action $S[\mathbf{q}(t)]$ is stationary. This means that the first variation of $S$ with respect to $\mathbf{q}(t)$ is zero:

$$
\delta S = 0.
$$

To find the equations of motion from this principle, consider a small variation $\delta \mathbf{q}(t)$ of the path $\mathbf{q}(t)$:

$$
\mathbf{q}(t) \to \mathbf{q}(t) + \delta \mathbf{q}(t).
$$

The variation in the action $S$ due to this small change is:

$$
\delta S = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \delta \mathbf{q} + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \delta \dot{\mathbf{q}} \right) dt.
$$

Applying integration by parts to the term involving $\delta \dot{\mathbf{q}}$, and noting that $\delta \mathbf{q}(t_1) = \delta \mathbf{q}(t_2) = 0$ (since the endpoints are fixed), we have:

$$
\delta S = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{q}} - \frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \right) \delta \mathbf{q} \, dt.
$$

For this expression to be zero for any arbitrary variation $\delta \mathbf{q}(t)$, the term in parentheses must vanish, leading to the **Euler-Lagrange equations**:

$$
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \right) - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{q}} = 0.
$$

These are the equations of motion for the system under consideration.

### Connection to Classical Mechanics

The Euler-Lagrange equations derived from the stationary action principle are equivalent to Newton's laws in classical mechanics. For example, in a system with a single particle of mass $m$ moving in a potential $V(\mathbf{q})$, the Lagrangian is:

$$
L(\mathbf{q}, \dot{\mathbf{q}}) = \frac{1}{2}m \dot{\mathbf{q}}^2 - V(\mathbf{q}).
$$

Applying the Euler-Lagrange equation gives:

$$
m \ddot{\mathbf{q}} + \nabla V(\mathbf{q}) = 0,
$$

which is simply Newton's second law, $\mathbf{F} = m \mathbf{a}$, where the force $\mathbf{F}$ is given by $-\nabla V(\mathbf{q})$.

### Stationary Action Principle in Quantum Mechanics and Field Theory

The principle of stationary action extends beyond classical mechanics. In quantum mechanics, it underpins Feynman's path integral formulation, where the probability amplitude for a particle to move from one point to another is obtained by summing over all possible paths, weighted by $e^{iS/\hbar}$, where $S$ is the action for each path. The stationary phase approximation in this formulation recovers the classical path as the path for which the action is stationary.

In field theory, the action principle is applied to fields rather than particles. The action is usually an integral over spacetime of a Lagrangian density $\mathcal{L}$, which depends on the fields and their derivatives:

$$
S[\phi(x)] = \int \mathcal{L}(\phi(x), \partial_\mu \phi(x)) \, d^4x.
$$

The requirement that the action is stationary with respect to variations in the field $\phi(x)$ leads to the **Euler-Lagrange equations for fields**, which are the equations of motion for the fields.

### Conclusion

The **Stationary Action Principle** is a powerful and unifying concept in physics, applicable across many domains from classical mechanics to quantum field theory. It provides a concise way to derive the equations of motion for a wide range of systems and underlies many fundamental theories in modern physics.
