**ASSISTANT**

3. **Awareness of Biases**:
   - Increasing awareness of cognitive biases, such as confirmation bias and the availability heuristic, can help people recognize when they might be falling into the trap of causal illusions. This awareness allows individuals to question their assumptions and seek out alternative explanations.

### Conclusion

**Causal illusions** arise when individuals mistakenly perceive a causal link between two events that are unrelated or only weakly related. These illusions are often driven by cognitive biases like temporal contiguity, confirmation bias, and the illusion of control. Causal illusions are common in everyday life and manifest in superstitions, pseudoscience, and conspiracy theories. Recognizing and addressing these illusions requires critical thinking, scientific methods, and a clear understanding of the difference between correlation and causation.
