Mathematics of Distributed Representations


**ASSISTANT**

The mathematics of distributed representations is fundamental to understanding how neural networks encode and process information. Distributed representations typically involve vectors in high-dimensional spaces and rely on various mathematical operations to manipulate these vectors. Here's an in-depth look at the key mathematical concepts and techniques involved:

### Key Mathematical Concepts

#### Vectors and Vector Spaces

- **Vectors**: In the context of distributed representations, a vector is an ordered list of numbers that can represent features of data, such as words, images, or other entities.
  - Example: A word embedding might be a vector like \( \mathbf{v} = [0.1, 0.3, -0.7, \ldots, 0.5] \).

- **Vector Spaces**: A vector space is a collection of vectors that can be added together and multiplied by scalars to produce another vector within the same space.
  - **Properties**: Vector spaces are defined by their dimensionality and the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication.

#### Linear Algebra Operations

- **Dot Product**: The dot product of two vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) is a scalar value that measures their similarity.
  \[
  \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i b_i
  \]
  - Applications: In word embeddings, the dot product can measure the semantic similarity between words.

- **Matrix Multiplication**: Matrices can represent linear transformations. Multiplying a vector by a matrix transforms the vector according to the matrix's properties.
  \[
  \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{W} \mathbf{x}
  \]
  - Applications: In neural networks, weight matrices transform input vectors into new representations at each layer.

- **Norms**: The norm of a vector measures its magnitude. Common norms include the L2 norm (Euclidean distance).
  \[
  \|\mathbf{v}\|_2 = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} v_i^2}
  \]
  - Applications: Norms can regularize neural networks, ensuring weights do not grow too large.

#### Manifold Learning

- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: A technique to reduce the dimensionality of data by projecting it onto a lower-dimensional space that captures the most variance.
  \[
  \mathbf{Z} = \mathbf{XW}
  \]
  - \(\mathbf{X}\) is the data matrix, \(\mathbf{W}\) contains the principal components, and \(\mathbf{Z}\) is the transformed data.

- **t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)**: A nonlinear technique for reducing high-dimensional data to two or three dimensions for visualization.
  - Applications: Visualizing high-dimensional word embeddings or other feature vectors.

### Neural Network Architectures

#### Feedforward Neural Networks

- **Layers and Activation Functions**: Each layer in a neural network transforms the input vector using a weight matrix and an activation function.
  \[
  \mathbf{h} = f(\mathbf{W} \mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b})
  \]
  - \(\mathbf{W}\) is the weight matrix, \(\mathbf{b}\) is the bias vector, and \(f\) is the activation function (e.g., ReLU, sigmoid).

#### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

- **Convolutions**: Apply convolutional filters to input data, capturing spatial hierarchies in images.
  \[
  \mathbf{y}_{i,j,k} = \sum_{m,n} \mathbf{W}_{m,n,k} \cdot \mathbf{x}_{i+m,j+n}
  \]
  - \(\mathbf{W}\) is the convolutional filter, \(\mathbf{x}\) is the input image, and \(\mathbf{y}\) is the feature map.

#### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

- **Recurrent Connections**: Capture temporal dependencies by maintaining a hidden state that evolves over time.
  \[
  \mathbf{h}_t = f(\mathbf{W}_h \mathbf{h}_{t-1} + \mathbf{W}_x \mathbf{x}_t)
  \]
  - \(\mathbf{h}_t\) is the hidden state at time \(t\), \(\mathbf{W}_h\) and \(\mathbf{W}_x\) are weight matrices for the hidden state and input, respectively.

### Training Neural Networks

#### Loss Functions

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
  \[
  \text{MSE} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
  \]

- **Cross-Entropy Loss**: Commonly used for classification tasks, measuring the difference between predicted probability distributions and actual labels.
  \[
  \text{Cross-Entropy} = -\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_i \log(\hat{y}_i)
  \]

#### Optimization

- **Gradient Descent**: Iteratively adjusts the weights to minimize the loss function.
  \[
  \mathbf{W} \leftarrow \mathbf{W} - \eta \nabla \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{W})
  \]
  - \(\eta\) is the learning rate, and \(\nabla \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{W})\) is the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights.

- **Backpropagation**: Computes the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight by applying the chain rule through the network layers.

#### Regularization

- **L2 Regularization**: Adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the sum of the squared weights.
  \[
  \mathcal{L}_{\text{reg}} = \mathcal{L} + \lambda \sum_{i} \mathbf{W}_i^2
  \]

- **Dropout**: Randomly sets a fraction of the input units to zero at each update during training to prevent overfitting.

### Word Embeddings

#### Word2Vec

- **Skip-Gram Model**: Predicts surrounding words given a target word.
  \[
  \mathcal{L} = -\sum_{t=1}^{T} \sum_{-c \leq j \leq c, j \neq 0} \log P(w_{t+j} | w_t)
  \]

- **Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW)**: Predicts a target word given surrounding context words.

#### GloVe

- **Global Vectors for Word Representation**: Captures co-occurrence statistics of words from a corpus to create word vectors.
  \[
  \mathcal{L} = \sum_{i,j=1}^{V} f(X_{ij}) (\mathbf{w}_i^T \mathbf{w}_j + b_i + b_j - \log X_{ij})^2
  \]
  - \(X_{ij}\) is the co-occurrence matrix, and \(f\) is a weighting function.

### Conclusion

The mathematics of distributed representations underpins the functionality and success of modern neural networks and AI systems. By leveraging vectors, linear algebra, optimization techniques, and advanced neural architectures, these representations enable the encoding, processing, and manipulation of complex data patterns. Understanding these mathematical foundations is crucial for designing, training, and interpreting neural network models in various applications, from natural language processing to computer vision.
