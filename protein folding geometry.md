title: protein folding geometry

**USER**

protein folding geometry


**ASSISTANT**

The user wants me to create a wiki entry for a technical reference wiki about protein folding geometry. This should be formatted for an Obsidian vault with double-bracketed links for novel concepts. The user has advanced degrees in applied mathematics, statistics, and philosophy of science, so I should provide deeply technical explanations with concrete mathematical formalisms. I should also propose symbolic notation for modeling the topic and avoid physics conventions or explain them in accessible mathematical terms.

This should be written as a standalone wiki page, not a conversational response. I need to focus on the geometric aspects of protein folding specifically.

Key areas to cover:
- Mathematical formalization of protein geometry
- Geometric constraints and degrees of freedom
- Conformational space and energy landscapes
- Geometric invariants and descriptors
- Topological considerations
- Symbolic notation for modeling

I should avoid conversational elements and write this as a technical reference.# Protein Folding Geometry

## Mathematical Framework

The geometry of [[protein folding]] can be formalized as a mapping from sequence space to conformational space, where the primary structure (amino acid sequence) determines constraints on the accessible three-dimensional configurations.

Let $\mathcal{S} = \{s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n\}$ represent a protein sequence of length $n$, where each $s_i \in \mathcal{A}$ belongs to the standard 20-letter amino acid alphabet. The [[conformational space]] $\mathcal{C}$ consists of all geometrically valid three-dimensional arrangements of the protein backbone and side chains.

## Backbone Geometry

The protein backbone follows a repeating pattern of N-Cα-C bonds, creating a [[polypeptide chain]] with constrained geometry. Each residue $i$ is characterized by two [[torsion angles]]:

- **Phi angle** ($\phi_i$): rotation around the N-Cα bond
- **Psi angle** ($\psi_i$): rotation around the Cα-C bond

The backbone geometry can be represented as:
$$\mathbf{B} = \{(\phi_i, \psi_i)\}_{i=1}^{n}$$

where each $(\phi_i, \psi_i) \in [-\pi, \pi]^2$, subject to [[steric constraints]] that restrict accessible regions of this [[Ramachandran space]].

## Geometric Constraints

### Bond Length Constraints
The covalent bond lengths impose rigid constraints:
$$\|\mathbf{r}_{i+1} - \mathbf{r}_i\| = l_{i,i+1}$$

where $\mathbf{r}_i \in \mathbb{R}^3$ represents the position of atom $i$ and $l_{i,i+1}$ is the fixed bond length.

### Bond Angle Constraints
The bond angles $\theta_{i-1,i,i+1}$ between consecutive bonds are approximately fixed:
$$\cos(\theta_{i-1,i,i+1}) = \frac{(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_{i-1}) \cdot (\mathbf{r}_{i+1} - \mathbf{r}_i)}{\|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_{i-1}\| \|\mathbf{r}_{i+1} - \mathbf{r}_i\|}$$

### Steric Exclusion
The [[excluded volume constraint]] prevents atomic overlap:
$$\|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j\| \geq \sigma_{i,j} \quad \forall i, j \text{ not covalently bonded}$$

where $\sigma_{i,j}$ represents the sum of van der Waals radii.

## Conformational Manifold

The space of valid conformations forms a [[conformational manifold]] $\mathcal{M} \subset \mathbb{R}^{3N}$, where $N$ is the total number of atoms. This manifold has dimension:
$$\dim(\mathcal{M}) = 3N - 6 - C$$

where $C$ represents the number of independent geometric constraints.

For a protein backbone with $n$ residues, the effective dimensionality reduces to approximately $2n$ degrees of freedom (the dihedral angles), subject to steric and other constraints.

## Distance Geometry Representation

An alternative geometric representation uses the [[distance matrix]] $\mathbf{D} \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times N}$:
$$D_{ij} = \|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j\|$$

The distance matrix must satisfy the [[metric constraints]]:
1. **Symmetry**: $D_{ij} = D_{ji}$
2. **Non-negativity**: $D_{ij} \geq 0$
3. **Triangle inequality**: $D_{ij} \leq D_{ik} + D_{kj}$ for all $i, j, k$

## Topological Invariants

### Knot Topology
Proteins can form [[topological knots]], characterized by the [[Alexander polynomial]] $\Delta(t)$ or the [[Jones polynomial]] $V(q)$. For a closed curve representation of the backbone, the knot type provides a topological invariant.

### Gaussian Curvature
Local geometric properties can be characterized using [[differential geometry]] measures. The [[mean curvature]] $H$ and [[Gaussian curvature]] $K$ of the backbone curve provide geometric descriptors:

$$H = \frac{1}{2}(\kappa_1 + \kappa_2)$$
$$K = \kappa_1 \kappa_2$$

where $\kappa_1, \kappa_2$ are the principal curvatures.

## Energy Landscape Geometry

The [[protein energy landscape]] $E: \mathcal{M} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ defines a scalar field over the conformational manifold. Critical points satisfy:
$$\nabla E(\mathbf{r}) = \mathbf{0}$$

The [[Hessian matrix]] $\mathbf{H} = \nabla^2 E$ characterizes local geometry:
- **Minima**: $\mathbf{H}$ positive definite
- **Saddle points**: $\mathbf{H}$ indefinite
- **Maxima**: $\mathbf{H}$ negative definite

## Geometric Descriptors

### Radius of Gyration
The [[radius of gyration]] quantifies overall compactness:
$$R_g = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} \|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_{cm}\|^2}$$

where $\mathbf{r}_{cm} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbf{r}_i$ is the center of mass.

### Asphericity
The [[asphericity]] measures deviation from spherical symmetry using the [[gyration tensor]] $\mathbf{G}$:
$$G_{\alpha\beta} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} (r_{i,\alpha} - r_{cm,\alpha})(r_{i,\beta} - r_{cm,\beta})$$

The asphericity is defined as:
$$A = \frac{\lambda_1 - \frac{1}{2}(\lambda_2 + \lambda_3)}{\lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + \lambda_3}$$

where $\lambda_1 \geq \lambda_2 \geq \lambda_3$ are eigenvalues of $\mathbf{G}$.

## Symbolic Notation

We propose the following notation for modeling protein folding geometry:

- $\Omega(\mathbf{s})$: the set of all geometrically valid conformations for sequence $\mathbf{s}$
- $\mathcal{G}(\mathbf{r})$: geometric constraint function returning violations
- $\mathcal{T}(\mathbf{r})$: topological invariant function
- $\Phi: \mathcal{M} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^k$: geometric feature map to $k$-dimensional descriptor space

## Geometric Sampling

The problem of [[conformational sampling]] becomes one of exploring the constrained manifold $\mathcal{M}$. Standard approaches include:

1. **Monte Carlo on manifolds**: sampling with constraint preservation
2. **Geodesic integration**: following natural curves on $\mathcal{M}$
3. **Projected dynamics**: constraining motion to the manifold tangent space

The [[detailed balance condition]] for geometric Monte Carlo requires:
$$\pi(\mathbf{r}_i) T(\mathbf{r}_i \rightarrow \mathbf{r}_j) = \pi(\mathbf{r}_j) T(\mathbf{r}_j \rightarrow \mathbf{r}_i)$$

where $\pi(\mathbf{r})$ is the target distribution and $T$ is the transition kernel.
