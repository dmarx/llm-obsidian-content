Cahn-Hilliard Theory


**ASSISTANT**

The Cahn-Hilliard theory is a mathematical framework used to describe the process of [[phase separation]] in binary mixtures. It was developed by John W. Cahn and John E. Hilliard in the 1950s and 1960s. This theory models the time evolution of concentration fields in a system undergoing [[phase separation]] and captures the dynamics of processes like spinodal decomposition and nucleation.

## Overview

### Phase Separation

Phase separation occurs when a homogeneous mixture of two components (e.g., A and B) separates into distinct regions or phases with different compositions. This process can be driven by changes in temperature, pressure, or composition, leading to the formation of a microstructure that minimizes the system's free energy.

### Cahn-Hilliard Equation

The Cahn-Hilliard equation describes the time evolution of the concentration field \( \phi(\mathbf{x}, t) \), which represents the difference in concentration between the two components. The equation is derived from a [[free energy functional]] and incorporates both diffusion and the effects of composition gradients.

### Free Energy Functional

The [[free energy functional]] \( F \) in the Cahn-Hilliard theory is given by:

$$
F[\phi] = \int d^3 x \left( f(\phi) + \frac{\kappa}{2} (\nabla \phi)^2 \right)
$$

where:
- \( f(\phi) \) is the local free energy density, typically having a double-well form to represent two stable phases.
- \( \kappa \) is a positive constant related to the energy cost of concentration gradients.

A common choice for the local free energy density is a double-well potential:

$$
f(\phi) = \frac{A}{2} \phi^2 + \frac{B}{4} \phi^4
$$

where \( A \) and \( B \) are constants, with \( A < 0 \) ensuring a double-well shape.

### Cahn-Hilliard Equation

The time evolution of the concentration field is governed by the Cahn-Hilliard equation:

$$
\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} = M \nabla^2 \left( \frac{\delta F}{\delta \phi} \right)
$$

where:
- \( M \) is the mobility, a positive constant that controls the rate of diffusion.
- \( \frac{\delta F}{\delta \phi} \) is the functional derivative of the [[free energy functional]] with respect to \( \phi \).

The functional derivative is given by:

$$
\frac{\delta F}{\delta \phi} = \frac{d f(\phi)}{d \phi} - \kappa \nabla^2 \phi
$$

Thus, the Cahn-Hilliard equation becomes:

$$
\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} = M \nabla^2 \left( \frac{d f(\phi)}{d \phi} - \kappa \nabla^2 \phi \right)
$$

### Dimensionless Form

To simplify analysis, the Cahn-Hilliard equation is often non-dimensionalized. Introducing dimensionless variables:

$$
\tilde{\mathbf{x}} = \mathbf{x} / L, \quad \tilde{t} = t / T, \quad \tilde{\phi} = \phi / \phi_0
$$

where \( L \) is a characteristic length scale, \( T \) is a characteristic time scale, and \( \phi_0 \) is a characteristic concentration. The dimensionless Cahn-Hilliard equation can be written as:

$$
\frac{\partial \tilde{\phi}}{\partial \tilde{t}} = \tilde{M} \nabla^2 \left( \frac{\partial f(\tilde{\phi})}{\partial \tilde{\phi}} - \tilde{\kappa} \nabla^2 \tilde{\phi} \right)
$$

where \( \tilde{M} \) and \( \tilde{\kappa} \) are dimensionless parameters.

## Applications

### Spinodal Decomposition

Spinodal decomposition is a mechanism of [[phase separation]] that occurs when a homogeneous mixture becomes unstable and spontaneously decomposes into two phases. The Cahn-Hilliard equation describes the initial rapid growth of composition fluctuations and the subsequent coarsening process.

### Nucleation and Growth

In systems where the mixture is metastable, [[phase separation]] occurs through nucleation and growth. Nuclei of the new phase form within the old phase, and the Cahn-Hilliard equation models the evolution of these nuclei as they grow and coalesce.

### Materials Science

The Cahn-Hilliard theory is widely used in materials science to model microstructural evolution in alloys, polymers, and other materials. It helps in understanding the formation of patterns, such as spinodal decomposition patterns, lamellar structures, and other complex morphologies.

### Biological Systems

In biological systems, the Cahn-Hilliard equation is used to model processes such as pattern formation in tissues, [[phase separation]] in cell membranes, and the formation of membrane-less organelles.

## Numerical Solutions

The Cahn-Hilliard equation is typically solved numerically due to its nonlinear nature. Common numerical methods include:
- **Finite Difference Methods**: Discretizing the spatial and temporal derivatives on a grid.
- **Spectral Methods**: Using Fourier transforms to solve the equation in the frequency domain.
- **Finite Element Methods**: Discretizing the equation using finite element techniques for complex geometries.
