McKean-Vlasov Dynamics


**ASSISTANT**

McKean-Vlasov dynamics, also known as mean-field-type interactions, describe the behavior of stochastic processes where the evolution of each individual particle or agent is influenced by the statistical distribution of the entire system. These dynamics are widely used in various fields, including physics, biology, economics, and particularly in mean field game (MFG) theory and stochastic control.

### Basic Concept

In McKean-Vlasov dynamics, each agent's state evolution depends not only on its current state and control but also on the distribution of the states of all agents. This leads to a form of interaction that is averaged over the population, rather than direct pairwise interactions.

### Mathematical Formulation

Consider a system of \( N \) agents with state \( \mathbf{x}_i(t) \) for agent \( i \). The state evolution of each agent is governed by the following stochastic differential equation (SDE):

\[ d\mathbf{x}_i(t) = \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}_i(t), \mu_t) dt + \mathbf{G}(\mathbf{x}_i(t), \mu_t) d\mathbf{w}_i(t), \]

where:
- \( \mathbf{x}_i(t) \) is the state of the \( i \)-th agent at time \( t \),
- \( \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}, \mu_t) \) is the drift term,
- \( \mathbf{G}(\mathbf{x}, \mu_t) \) is the diffusion term,
- \( \mathbf{w}_i(t) \) is a standard Wiener process representing individual noise,
- \( \mu_t \) is the probability distribution of the states of all agents at time \( t \).

### Mean Field Limit

As the number of agents \( N \) goes to infinity, the empirical distribution of the states \( \mu_t \) converges to a deterministic measure. The evolution of this measure is described by the McKean-Vlasov equation, a type of Fokker-Planck equation.

### McKean-Vlasov Equation

The McKean-Vlasov equation for the probability density \( p(\mathbf{x}, t) \) of the state \( \mathbf{x} \) at time \( t \) is:

\[ \frac{\partial p(\mathbf{x}, t)}{\partial t} = -\nabla \cdot \left[ \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}, \mu_t) p(\mathbf{x}, t) \right] + \frac{1}{2} \nabla \cdot \nabla \cdot \left[ \mathbf{G}(\mathbf{x}, \mu_t) \mathbf{G}^T(\mathbf{x}, \mu_t) p(\mathbf{x}, t) \right], \]

where \( \mu_t = p(\mathbf{x}, t) \) is the density of the mean field.

### Applications

1. **Mean Field Games (MFG)**:
   In MFG theory, the McKean-Vlasov dynamics describe the evolution of agents' states, where each agent optimizes its own objective function considering the mean field, which is the distribution of states of all agents.

2. **Economics**:
   Modeling the behavior of a large number of interacting economic agents, such as consumers or firms, whose decisions depend on the aggregate distribution of states.

3. **Physics**:
   Describing the behavior of particles in systems with mean-field interactions, such as plasma or large ensembles of interacting particles.

4. **Biology**:
   Modeling populations of interacting individuals, such as cells or animals, where each individual's behavior is influenced by the overall population distribution.

### Example: Linear-Quadratic McKean-Vlasov Control

Consider a linear-quadratic control problem where the dynamics and cost depend on the mean field.

1. **Dynamics**:
   \[ d\mathbf{x}_i(t) = (A \mathbf{x}_i(t) + B \mathbf{u}_i(t) + F \mathbb{E}[\mathbf{x}_i(t)]) dt + \sigma d\mathbf{w}_i(t), \]
   where \( A \), \( B \), and \( F \) are matrices, and \( \sigma \) is the diffusion coefficient.

2. **Cost Functional**:
   \[ J_i(\mathbf{u}_i) = \mathbb{E} \left[ \int_0^T \left( \mathbf{x}_i(t)^T Q \mathbf{x}_i(t) + \mathbf{u}_i(t)^T R \mathbf{u}_i(t) + \mathbb{E}[\mathbf{x}_i(t)]^T S \mathbb{E}[\mathbf{x}_i(t)] \right) dt + \mathbf{x}_i(T)^T P \mathbf{x}_i(T) \right], \]
   where \( Q \), \( R \), \( S \), and \( P \) are weighting matrices.

### Solution Approach

1. **Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) Equation**:
   The HJB equation for the value function \( V(\mathbf{x}, t) \) is:
   \[ \frac{\partial V}{\partial t} + \min_{\mathbf{u}} \left[ \mathbf{x}^T Q \mathbf{x} + \mathbf{u}^T R \mathbf{u} + \mathbb{E}[\mathbf{x}]^T S \mathbb{E}[\mathbf{x}] + \nabla V \cdot (A \mathbf{x} + B \mathbf{u} + F \mathbb{E}[\mathbf{x}]) + \frac{1}{2} \text{Tr}(\sigma \sigma^T \mathbf{H} V) \right] = 0, \]
   with terminal condition:
   \[ V(\mathbf{x}, T) = \mathbf{x}^T P \mathbf{x}. \]

2. **Optimal Control**:
   The optimal control is:
   \[ \mathbf{u}_i^*(t) = -R^{-1} B^T \nabla V(\mathbf{x}_i(t), t). \]

3. **Fokker-Planck Equation**:
   The evolution of the mean field is described by the Fokker-Planck equation:
   \[ \frac{\partial p(\mathbf{x}, t)}{\partial t} = -\nabla \cdot \left[ (A \mathbf{x} + B \mathbf{u}^* + F \mathbb{E}[\mathbf{x}]) p(\mathbf{x}, t) \right] + \frac{1}{2} \nabla \cdot \nabla \cdot \left[ \sigma \sigma^T p(\mathbf{x}, t) \right]. \]

### Numerical Methods

Solving McKean-Vlasov dynamics analytically is often challenging, so numerical methods are crucial:

1. **Particle Methods**:
   Simulate a large number of agents and approximate the mean field by the empirical distribution of their states.

2. **Finite Difference Methods**:
   Discretize the PDEs on a grid and solve them iteratively.

3. **Spectral Methods**:
   Use basis functions to approximate the solution and solve the resulting system of equations.

### Conclusion

McKean-Vlasov dynamics provide a framework for modeling systems where the evolution of each agent's state depends on the overall distribution of states. This approach is fundamental in [[mean field game theory]], allowing the analysis and optimization of large populations of interacting agents. The coupled HJB and Fokker-Planck equations characterize the optimal strategies and the evolution of the mean field, providing a powerful tool for understanding complex systems in various fields.
