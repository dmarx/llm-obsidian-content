- And the Supreme Court has destroyed
0:02
the entire federal government.
0:04
Well, that's only slight hyperbole,
0:06
maybe just the entire administrative state.
0:08
Now you might have heard of Chevron or Chevron deference.
0:11
Well, the Supreme Court just killed it,
0:12
and that's a big deal, it's a huge deal.
0:15
It's one of those things that generally
0:16
you have to be in the know to understand,
0:19
but it would be like if the Supreme Court
0:20
just said all briefs must be filed in Latin,
0:22
maybe it won't affect you on an everyday basis,
0:25
but it really screws up the judicial system
0:26
and it's going to be a pain in ass
0:28
for lawyers and judges going forward.
0:29
Now to understand this massive decision,
0:31
you need a quick primer on administrative law.
0:33
Here's three things you need to know.
0:34
First, Congress passes laws,
0:36
and generally courts interpret those laws
0:37
because sometimes those laws are ambiguous.
0:39
A lot of those laws establish or empower federal agencies
0:42
because the government is big and does a lot of stuff.
0:45
And finally, a ton of what those agencies do
0:47
is highly technical or scientific.
0:50
So sometimes Congress intentionally leaves laws ambiguous
0:52
so those agencies can do their jobs.
0:54
And Chevron deference is all about what happens
0:56
when a federal agency deals with an ambiguous law.
0:59
A chaos lawyer, Liz Dye, has more on this catastrophe.
1:02
- Thanks, Devin.
1:03
The Supreme Court has executed
1:05
its biggest power grab in decades,
1:06
and it's all thanks to a tiny little fish.
1:09
Yes, the nation's high court issued
1:11
a joint holding in two cases
1:12
known as Loper Bright Enterprises versus Gina Raimondo,
1:15
the Secretary of the Department of Commerce,
1:17
and Relentless, Inc. v. Department of Commerce,
1:20
both of which involved regulation
1:22
of herring fishing in ocean waters.
1:24
The ruling which overturns a longstanding principle
1:27
known as Chevron deference paves the way
1:29
for courts to rewrite administrative regulations
1:32
more or less at will.
1:33
So now, judges can overrule those pesky experts
1:36
on stuff like what constitutes
1:38
a distinct population segment
1:39
under the Endangered Species Act.
1:41
When does an alpha amino acid polymer qualify
1:43
as a biological product
1:45
under the Public Health Services Act?
1:47
Or how much airplane noise reduction is sufficient
1:49
to substantially restore the natural quiet
1:52
of the Grand Canyon under the 1987 Over Flights Act?
1:55
Those three examples come from the dissent
1:57
authored by Justice Elena Kagan
1:59
and joined by her fellow liberal justices,
2:01
Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson.
2:04
As Kagan notes, the majority's holding
2:06
in Loper Bright allows courts
2:07
to substitute their judgment
2:09
for that of scientists and policy wonks
2:11
who certainly know more about the topic than federal judges.
2:14
And that represents a massive shift of power
2:17
away from the executive branch to the judiciary.
2:20
It all started in 1977 when Congress
2:22
amended the Clean Air Act to force polluters
2:25
to submit to a permitting process known as New Source Review
2:28
every time they wanted to construct
2:30
a new stationary source of pollution.
2:32
Under President Jimmy Carter,
2:34
the Environmental Protection Agency interpreted the law
2:36
to require permits for every new smokestack.
2:39
So to be clear, Congress did its job and enacted a law,
2:44
and then the executive branch implemented it
2:46
through rules and regulations, which is its job.
2:49
But when President Reagan was elected in 1980,
2:52
his EPA took a different approach.
2:54
It decided that new source review was only triggered
2:57
if the improvement increased
2:59
the amount of pollution in the bubble of the entire project.
3:02
So a factory could install
3:03
a new highly-polluting modification without a permit
3:06
so long as its overall emissions didn't go up,
3:09
defeating the purpose of the Clean Air Act Amendments,
3:12
which were intended to force new construction
3:14
that reduced pollution overall.
3:16
In 1981, the National Resources Defense Counsel
3:19
sued the EPA in federal court in D.C.
3:22
That case was captioned NRDC versus Gorsuch
3:25
because the nominal defendant
3:26
was EPA Administrator, Anne Gorsuch,
3:29
the mother of future Supreme Court Justice, Neil Gorsuch.
3:32
In an opinion authored
3:33
by future Supreme Court Justice, Ruth Bader Ginsburg,
3:36
the D.C. Circuit invalidated the rule change
3:39
because it conflicted with both precedent
3:41
and the stated purpose of the statute,
3:43
which was to reduce pollution.
3:45
The Chevron Corporation,
3:47
an oil behemoth whose interest did not lie
3:49
in cleaning up the environment intervened,
3:51
and by the time the case landed at the Supreme Court,
3:54
it had been rechristened "Chevron USA versus NRDC."
3:57
Writing for a unanimous court,
3:59
Justice John Paul Stevens reversed the D.C. Circuit
4:02
articulating what was known for the past 40 years
4:05
as the Chevron doctrine or Chevron deference.
4:08
Under Chevron, courts conducted a three-part test
4:11
when faced with a challenge
4:12
to an executive agency's interpretation of federal law.
4:15
First, the courts examined the statute
4:17
authorizing the agency action
4:19
to see if its language was ambiguous.
4:21
If there was ambiguity, it was presumed
4:23
that the agency was authorized to make rules
4:26
to fill any gap left implicitly or explicitly by Congress.
4:29
That gap constituted an expressed delegation of authority
4:32
to the agency to elucidate a specific provision
4:35
of the statute by regulation.
4:37
Second, the court assessed
4:39
whether the challenged agency interpretation was reasonable,
4:42
and if so, courts would defer to that interpretation,
4:45
hence the name, "Chevron deference."
4:47
Only if the agency's interpretation was unreasonable
4:50
would courts rewrite agency regulations
4:53
so as to make them comply with the law.
4:55
Justice Stevens noted that judges
4:57
are not experts in the field and are not part
4:59
of either political branch of the government.
5:01
When a challenge to an agency construction
5:03
of a statutory provision fairly conceptualized
5:06
really centers on the wisdom of the agency's position
5:10
rather than whether it is a reasonable choice
5:12
within a gap left open by Congress,
5:14
the challenge must fail.
5:16
In Chevron versus NRDC,
5:18
this meant that the EPA was free to water down
5:20
the standards that the Clean Air Act
5:22
and let corporations continue to pollute the air.
5:24
But in practice, this gave presidential agencies
5:27
broad power to interpret federal law
5:29
and enact regulations that reflected
5:31
the administration's political priorities.
5:33
So, for example,
5:35
the Trump and Biden administrations
5:37
took radically different approaches
5:38
to whether Title IX's prohibition
5:40
on discrimination because of sex,
5:42
required sports teams to include
5:45
or exclude transgender athletes.
5:47
Since the Chevron decision came down in 1984,
5:50
conservatives took control of the judiciary,
5:52
solidifying a six-seat majority on the Supreme Court
5:55
and seating the federal bench
5:56
with loads of federal judges
5:58
selected from the conservative movement
6:00
specifically to oppose liberal policies.
6:03
Meanwhile, as the country became ever more sharply divided,
6:06
Congress has become ever less effective,
6:08
passing fewer and fewer laws.
6:10
With Congress functionally broken,
6:12
presidents have come to rely more and more
6:14
on executive action and rulemaking.
6:16
And so overturning Chevron became one of the main goals
6:19
of the conservative movement,
6:21
allowing them to more easily challenge executive actions
6:24
by Democratic administrations
6:25
without the annoying obligation
6:27
to defer to an agency's interpretation of laws.
6:30
In 2020, Justice Thomas wrote that "Chevron compels judges
6:34
to abdicate the judicial power
6:35
without constitutional sanction,"
6:37
and "gives federal agencies unconstitutional power."
6:40
In 2022, Justice Gorsuch warned
6:43
that the doctrine poses a serious threat
6:45
to some of our most fundamental commitments
6:46
as judges and courts
6:47
and deserves a tombstone no one can miss.
6:50
And so it was clear that Chevron,
6:52
like Roe v. Wade was doomed,
6:54
although it wasn't obvious that Chevron
6:56
would be toppled by a tiny little fish.
6:58
- Now obviously, if you're gonna challenge
6:59
the entire administrative state,
7:00
you're gonna need a good lawyer.

7:29
- In 1976, Congress enacted
7:31
the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation
7:33
and Management Act,
7:34
so named for Democratic Senator, Warren Magnuson,
7:37
and Republican Senator, Ted Stevens.
7:39
The law established
7:40
eight regional fishery management councils
7:42
dedicated to protecting commercial fishing stocks.
7:45
The councils were vested with various powers,
7:47
including authority to require
7:48
that one or more observers be carried on board a vessel
7:51
for the purpose of collecting data necessary
7:53
for the conservation and management of the fishery.
7:55
And it was that power enumerated
7:58
in 16 U.S.C. section 1853 B,
8:01
which wound up taking out the edifice
8:02
that held up administrative law in this country
8:05
for 40 years because the law did not specify
8:08
how those observers were to be funded,
8:10
or to be more precise,
8:12
it did, but not super clearly.
8:14
Section 1855 contained a general implementing clause
8:17
authorizing the Secretary of the Department of Commerce
8:20
to promulgate such regulations
8:22
as may be necessary to discharge such responsibility
8:25
or to carry out any other provision of the act.
8:27
And section 1858 G allowed the councils
8:30
to punish any vessel owner
8:32
for failing to pay for the observer services,
8:34
which would strongly imply that Congress
8:36
intended the councils to be able to charge boats
8:39
for the observers.
8:40
And that was certainly the position taken
8:42
by Donald Trump's Secretary of Commerce, Wilbur Ross,
8:45
but it was not the position taken by a company
8:47
called Loper Bright Enterprises,
8:48
which sued the Department of Commerce in February of 2020,
8:51
calling the regulation an unlawful mandate
8:53
by the federal government that herring fishermen
8:56
along the eastern seaboard of the United States to carry
8:58
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration contractors,
9:02
called "at-sea monitors," on their vessels
9:04
during fishing trips, and moreover,
9:06
to pay out-of-pocket for costs associated
9:08
with allowing these government contractors
9:10
to monitor their fishing activity.
9:12
Two weeks later, a similar lawsuit was filed
9:14
by a commercial fishing company
9:16
under the caption "Relentless, Inc. v. Ross."
9:19
Now here's a fun tip:
9:20
When you're trying to figure out why a lawsuit was filed,
9:23
skip to the signature block
9:25
and Google the lawyers who put their names on it.
9:27
The Loper Bright case was brought
9:29
by Ryan Mulvey and Eric Bolinder,
9:31
two lawyers from the group, Americans for Prosperity,
9:33
which was set up by billionaire brothers,
9:35
Charles and David Koch,
9:36
to combat climate legislation, unions,
9:38
and minimum wage laws,
9:39
and generally fight all progressive policies.
9:42
And the relentless case was brought by lawyers
9:44
from the new Civil Liberties Alliance,
9:46
another group funded by the Koch brothers
9:48
to attack government regulations,
9:50
which is a pretty good indication
9:52
that the fish here was just a big old red herring.
9:55
These cases were always torpedoes
9:57
aimed straight at the Chevron doctrine
9:59
and they scored a direct hit.
10:01
The plaintiffs lost at the trial courts
10:03
in D.C. and Rhode Island,
10:04
and then lost again at the D.C. in First Circuits.
10:07
And by the time they wound up at the Supreme Court,
10:09
the only question being considered
10:11
was whether the court should overrule Chevron
10:14
or at least clarify that statutory silence
10:16
concerning controversial powers expressly
10:18
but narrowly granted elsewhere in the statute
10:21
does not constitute an ambiguity
10:23
requiring deference to the agency.
10:25
In short, the justices had given up the red herring
10:28
and were aiming straight for the iceberg.
10:29
- Iceberg right ahead. - Thank you.
10:32
- Chief Justice Roberts wrote the opinion
10:34
for the court's six conservatives,
10:35
framing the reversal of Chevron
10:37
as the righteous repudiation of a grievous error.
10:39
In his telling, Chevron ushered in a four-decade period
10:42
of judicial laziness
10:44
where courts abdicated their responsibilities
10:46
under the Constitution.
10:47
He said, "When faced with a statutory ambiguity,
10:50
the ambiguity is not a delegation to anybody,
10:52
and a court is not somehow relieved
10:53
of its obligation to independently interpret the statute."
10:56
He quoted Chief Justice John Marshall
10:58
from 1803 saying in Marbury v. Madison
11:00
that it is "Emphatically the province and duty
11:03
of the judicial department to say what the law is."
11:05
He quoted The Federalist papers
11:07
noting that the Framers also envisioned
11:08
that the final interpretation of the laws
11:10
would be the proper and peculiar province of the court.
11:13
He also quoted the Administrative Procedure Act,
11:16
which was originally passed in 1946
11:18
and specifies that courts, not agencies,
11:21
will decide all relevant questions of law.
11:23
He referenced various respected commentators
11:25
who endorsed his position
11:27
that only the court can interpret a law
11:29
and that the court owes respect but not deference
11:32
to the executive branch agencies
11:34
charged with actually carrying it out.
11:36
And he cited various attempts by his own court
11:38
to water down the holding in the past 20 years
11:41
as evidence that the Chevron test
11:43
imposes a dizzying break dance on the courts
11:45
and is wholly unworkable.
11:46
(upbeat music)
11:52
Even sneered at the bare quorum
11:53
of six justices who decided Chevron
11:56
since Justices, Marshall, Rehnquist, and O'Connor
11:58
recused themselves.
11:59
It's an odd way to describe a unanimous opinion,
12:02
particularly since Roberts himself
12:04
is speaking for just six justices,
12:07
and it's especially odd in a holding
12:09
where Justice Gorsuch's own mother
12:11
was the defendant in the case being overturned.
12:14
The majority's opinion boils down to this:
12:16
In every case where a statute is ambiguous,
12:18
there must be a best reading of the law,
12:20
and courts are obligated to use every tool at their disposal
12:23
to determine the best reading of the statute
12:25
and resolve the ambiguity themselves
12:27
rather than letting the experts tasked by Congress
12:30
and the voters fill in the blanks.
12:33
But as Justice Kagan's dissent
12:34
for the court's three liberals points out,
12:36
sometimes statutes are just sloppily drafted
12:39
and there is no best answer
12:41
for a blank Congress forgot to fill in.
12:43
And if there is a best answer,
12:44
it's probably not gonna be arrived at
12:46
by courts applying general principles of law.
12:49
In fact, it may not be a question of law at all.
12:52
The chief justice yada, yada, yadas
12:54
that Congress expects courts
12:55
to handle technical statutory questions.
12:57
That's a particularly ironic thing to say on the same day
13:01
when Justice Gorsuch dropped an opinion
13:03
in which he confused nitrogen oxide,
13:05
a greenhouse gas, with nitrous oxide,
13:08
better known as laughing gas.
13:09
(bottle rattling)
13:11
Because there isn't a balls and strikes answer
13:13
to every technical question
13:14
of administrative procedure,
13:16
and Justice Elena Kagan made this point
13:18
by highlighting a bunch of cases decided
13:20
on the basis of Chevron deference
13:21
like Teva Pharmaceuticals versus the FDA,
13:24
which turns on the question of
13:25
"When does an alpha amino acid polymer
13:27
qualify as a protein?"
13:28
Or "What does 'distinct' mean
13:30
when you're talking about various populations
13:32
of endangered squirrels?"
13:33
That was the issue in Northwest Ecosystem Alliance
13:36
versus U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services.
13:38
Or what does a geographic area mean
13:40
when you're talking about Medicare reimbursement rates?
13:42
See Bellevue Hospital Center v. Leavitt.
13:45
I'm a lawyer and a reasonably smart person
13:47
and I don't know the answer to those questions,
13:49
and neither did the federal judges who decided those cases
13:52
because there wasn't one best answer
13:55
for the court to divine by scrutinizing the statute
13:57
and applying principles of law.
13:59
Congress writes laws which are pretty general
14:01
and leaves it to the executive to carry them out,
14:04
which is why the judges deferred to the federal agencies
14:07
that administer the Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act
14:09
and the Endangered Species Act
14:10
and the Medicare Act to define those terms.
14:13
But according to Chief Justice Roberts,
14:15
it's actually the court's job to grab a pen
14:18
and mark up a statute any time the law is unclear.
14:20
He wrote, "It therefore makes no sense
14:23
to speak of a permissible interpretation
14:25
that is not the one the court,
14:26
after applying all relevant interpretive tools,
14:29
concludes is best.
14:30
In the business of statutory interpretation,
14:32
if it is not the best, it is not permissible."
14:35
- That line is hard to draw in some cases.
14:37
I would say not in most cases.
14:39
And make sure that this is the question that you,
14:41
the judge, are supposed to be deciding
14:43
rather than someone else.
14:45
- And it's certainly not what he said
14:47
about the foundational doctrine of stare decisis
14:49
or at least it's not what he to say.
14:51
Stare decisis is a Latin term
14:53
meaning to stand by things already decided.
14:56
In law, it means that precedent
14:58
is binding on subsequent courts,
15:00
and once an issue has been ruled on,
15:02
that is the law of the land.
15:03
And while the Supreme Court can overturn precedent,
15:06
there has always been a strong institutional taboo
15:08
against doing it because it makes the justices
15:11
seem like partisans who rule
15:12
based on their own policy preferences.
15:14
But precedent is also important
15:16
because we all rely on knowing what the law is.
15:18
And if that law is constantly changing,
15:21
then it can cause major civic and social instability.
15:23
- Please disperse, (individuals chattering)
15:26
nothing to see here, please. (individuals chattering)
15:28
- But Donald Trump's election prompted a major sea change.
15:31
He was able to name three justices
15:33
decisively swinging the Supreme Court to the right,
15:36
at which point conservatives got a whole lot less concerned
15:39
about stare decisis.
15:40
So during their confirmation hearings,
15:42
Justices Kavanaugh, Gorsuch mumbled a little bit
15:44
about Roe v. Wade being settled law
15:46
before immediately voting to overturn it in the Dobbs case.
15:50
Since then, senators have switched
15:52
to asking judicial nominees
15:53
whether Brown v. Board of Education,
15:55
the seminal school desegregation case
15:57
is settled law with alarming results.
16:00
- Do you believe that Brown versus Board of Education
16:02
was correctly decided?
16:07
- Senator, I don't mean to be coy,
16:10
but I think I get into a difficult area
16:18
when I start commenting on Supreme Court decisions
16:20
which are correctly decided
16:22
and which I may disagree with.
16:25
- Yikes, there is just no argument
16:27
that Chevron was anything other than settled law.
16:30
As Justice Kagan noted in her dissent,
16:32
the doctrine has been applied
16:33
in thousands of judicial decisions,
16:35
it has become a part of the warp and woof
16:37
of modern government supporting regulatory efforts
16:40
of all kinds to name a few,
16:41
keeping air and water clean, food and drugs safe,
16:44
and financial markets honest.
16:45
Overturning it requires total disregard for stare decisis,
16:49
and more than a wee smidge of judicial arrogance.
16:52
Luckily, Justice Gorsuch was happy to oblige.
16:55
In a 34-page concurrence, he praised the majority
16:58
for its brave act of judicial humility
17:00
in conceding that its own precedent was wrongly decided.
17:03
Then he celebrated the tombstone on Chevron
17:05
no one can miss, calling back to his own earlier writing
17:08
as all truly humble jurors do.
17:11
Along the way, he rubbish the idea of stare decisis,
17:13
generally noting that in the 18th century,
17:16
"Common law judges did not, broadly speaking,
17:18
afford overwhelming weight
17:19
to any, quote, 'single precedent'."
17:22
And in ye olde England,
17:23
a judge's decision might bind the parties
17:25
to the case at hand,
17:26
but none of that meant the judge
17:28
had the power to make a law properly so-called
17:31
for society at large
17:32
for that only the king in parliament can do.
17:35
The chief justice wasn't willing to go quite that far,
17:37
but that's why he spent so much time
17:39
talking about Mar v Madison
17:41
and pre Chevron practice
17:42
while claiming that Chevron was totally unworkable
17:45
and forced judges to break dance or whatever.
17:47
Because if you say, "Well, this law was working fine
17:50
for four decades, but we didn't like it,
17:52
and now we have the votes to overturn it, so we did,"
17:55
it sounds kind of bad.
17:56
Or as Justice Kagan put it,
17:57
"This court has avoided deferring under Chevron since 2016
18:01
because it has been preparing
18:02
to overrule Chevron since around that time.
18:05
That kind of self-help on the way to reversing precedent
18:07
has become almost routine at this court.
18:10
Stop applying a decision where one should,
18:12
'throw some gratuitous criticisms
18:13
into a couple opinions',
18:14
issue a few separate writings
18:16
questioning the decision's premises,
18:18
give the whole process a few years,
18:19
and voila, you have a justification
18:22
for overruling the decision."
18:24
Ouch, but Justice Kagan wasn't done
18:26
pointing out the hypocrisy.
18:27
She observed that the majority cannot destroy one doctrine
18:30
of judicial humility without making
18:31
a laughing stock of the second.
18:33
That is, the majority was so excited
18:35
to ditch the Chevron doctrine
18:37
and substitute their own opinions
18:38
for those of government experts
18:40
that it trampled the doctrine of stare decisis
18:42
and showed their whole herring to the world.
18:46
She added that "If opinions had titles,
18:48
a good candidate for today's would be Hubris Squared."
18:51
In his holding, the chief justice went out of his way
18:54
to minimize the chaos that this ruling will unleash.
18:57
He offered assurances
18:58
that all the previous decisions made
18:59
based on Chevron doctrine are still good law,
19:02
and the holdings of those cases
19:03
that specific agency actions are lawful,
19:05
including the Clean Air Act holding of Chevron itself,
19:08
are still subject to statutory stare decisis
19:11
despite our change in interpretive methodology.
19:14
But it cannot be overstated what an earthquake this will be
19:17
for administrative law.
19:18
If the EPA wants to regulate industry to cut pollution
19:21
or the FDA wants to ban harmful additives,
19:24
or the Labor Department wants to set standards
19:26
for overtime rules or the Federal Reserve
19:28
wants to limit credit card swipe fees,
19:29
all those things will be challenged.
19:31
In fact, that last one is not a hypothetical.
19:35
In a case called
19:36
Corner Post, Inc. v. Federal Reserve Board of Governors
19:38
decided on the last day of the term,
19:40
the Supreme Court effectively abolished
19:42
the statute of limitations
19:43
for challenges to an administrative regulation.
19:46
Previously, a rule had to be challenged
19:48
within six years of its enactment.
19:50
Now, a party has six years
19:52
from when it began being harmed to sue,
19:55
meaning that a bank can set up shop tomorrow
19:57
and challenge a rule that has been in place for decades
19:59
because its harm is brand new.
20:02
And as Vox's Ian Millhiser warns,
20:04
Loper Bright makes the courts
20:06
and ultimately the Supreme Court responsible
20:08
for resolving thousands of low stakes policy questions,
20:11
which often cannot be resolved simply
20:13
by reading the law's naked text.
20:15
The justices, in other words,
20:16
can look forward to missing
20:18
their children's basketball games,
20:19
skipping out on date nights with their spouses,
20:21
and not really doing much of anything at all
20:23
besides deciding the crushing weight of cases
20:26
that are about to land on their desks.
20:28
Yeah, boohoo.
20:29
A blog post by the Union of Concerned Scientists
20:31
predicts that the end of Chevron
20:33
will introduce a new level of difficulty
20:35
into the regulatory process.
20:36
Agencies like the EPA will need to try to anticipate
20:39
every potential legal challenge,
20:40
alleging statutory ambiguity
20:42
and prepare comprehensive justifications
20:45
that can withstand unbounded judicial scrutiny.
20:47
This could slow down the implementation of new regulations
20:50
as agencies might take more time
20:52
to ensure their rules can survive such legal challenges.
20:55
Worse, agencies may decide not to even try,
20:58
all of which is very bad for people
21:00
who like clean air and drinkable water
21:02
and overtime paying capping fees
21:04
lenders can charge consumers and hot dogs
21:06
without too much rat hair in them,
21:07
and a million other tiny decisions
21:09
which were previously made by experts
21:11
and will now be subject to challenge
21:13
by industry lawyers responsible to shareholders
21:15
in special interests and not answerable to voters.
21:18
But on the plus side,
21:20
Justice Gorsuch finally got that tombstone,
21:22
so I guess it was worth it.
21:24
- Now, that was a great explanation,
21:25
but I wanna emphasize more about this one two punch
21:27
of Loper Bright and Corner Post.
21:29
Because frankly, Corner Post might be an even bigger deal
21:31
than Loper Bright in the end of Chevron deference.
21:34
Because it's possible the end of Chevron deference
21:36
wouldn't have that big of an effect on its own,
21:38
in part because bad faith jurors have been claiming
21:40
to apply Chevron deference for years,
21:42
but basically just ignoring it
21:44
and coming to outcome-oriented decisions.
21:46
Many have said that Chevron has been dead for a while,
21:49
but now it's truly dead
21:50
and judges will be the last and only word
21:51
on ambiguous statutes.
21:53
And with Corner Post, truly, no federal regulation
21:56
will ever be settled.
21:57
Corner Post is effectively done away
21:59
with a statute of limitations
22:00
when it comes to federal regulations,
22:01
and that's going to lead
22:02
to an absolute deluge of litigation.
22:05
I would not want to be a federal judge right now.
22:07
They were already overworked and underpaid,
22:09
and now they're going to be interpreting
22:10
and reinterpreting regulations all the time.
22:13
But of course, it's not going to be all courts.
22:15
As we've already seen, there are a few judges,
22:17
especially in the middle of nowhere Texas,
22:18
that love nothing more than to overturn current laws.
22:21
So you're going to see thousands
22:23
of newly minted corporations
22:24
incorporated in Amarillo, Texas,
22:27
challenging a regulation,
22:28
and then going before that company's preferred judge
22:30
just to overrule federal regulations.
22:33
And additionally, because those judges
22:34
are not subject matter experts,
22:36
you're gonna get a lot of wacky decisions,
22:37
not necessarily smaller government,
22:39
but definitely weirder, less predictable government.
22:42
We're going to get a whole weird patchwork
22:44
of dually interpretations and rules
22:46
with inconsistencies between the states and circuits,
22:48
and we're gonna see a lot of junk science
22:50
and cherry-picked history
22:51
to get to outcome oriented decisions.
22:53
But if you are a federal judge
22:54
who will be interpreting a whole bunch
22:55
of technical regulations,
22:56
you'll probably need to brush up
22:57
on your math or science skills,
