### Bounded Rationality

**Bounded Rationality** is a concept introduced by Herbert A. Simon to describe the limitations on human cognitive abilities that affect decision-making processes. Unlike the classical economic assumption of perfect rationality, bounded rationality acknowledges that individuals have cognitive limitations, imperfect information, and finite time to make decisions. As a result, people use heuristics and [[satisficing]] strategies rather than optimizing.

### Key Concepts of Bounded Rationality

1. **Cognitive Limitations**: Human brains have limited processing power and memory, making it impossible to consider all possible options and outcomes.
2. **Incomplete Information**: Decision-makers rarely have access to all relevant information, leading to uncertainty.
3. **Satisficing**: Instead of seeking the optimal solution, individuals often settle for a solution that is "good enough" based on their current knowledge and constraints.
4. **Heuristics**: Simplified rules or mental shortcuts used to make decisions more manageable, often at the cost of some degree of accuracy.

### Implications for Decision-Making

1. **Simplified Models**: Decision-makers construct simplified models of the world to make it more manageable.
2. **Sequential Search**: Instead of evaluating all options simultaneously, individuals often evaluate them sequentially and choose the first satisfactory option.
3. **Aspiration Levels**: Decision-makers set aspiration levels or benchmarks for acceptable outcomes and adjust them based on experience and feedback.

### Applications in Various Fields

#### 1. **Economics**
   - **Behavioral Economics**: Incorporates bounded rationality into economic models to better predict actual human behavior, deviating from the assumption of perfect rationality.
   - **Market Behavior**: Investors and consumers use heuristics to make decisions under uncertainty, leading to phenomena such as herding behavior and market anomalies.

#### 2. **Game Theory**
   - **Quantal Response Equilibrium (QRE)**: Players make probabilistic choices based on their expected utility, reflecting bounded rationality.
   - **Level-K Thinking**: Players reason iteratively about others' strategies, where level-0 players choose randomly, level-1 best respond to level-0, and so on.

#### 3. **Organizational Behavior**
   - **Decision-Making Processes**: Managers use heuristics and [[satisficing]] in complex organizational settings due to time and information constraints.
   - **Problem-Solving**: Organizations adopt simplified decision-making frameworks to deal with complex problems.

### Theoretical Frameworks

#### 1. **Herbert Simon's Model**
Simon proposed that decision-making involves three main stages: 
- **Intelligence**: Identifying and understanding the problem.
- **Design**: Developing possible solutions.
- **Choice**: Selecting a satisfactory solution.

This process is iterative and adaptive, reflecting the dynamic nature of decision-making under bounded rationality.

#### 2. **Heuristics and Biases (Tversky and Kahneman)**
Tversky and Kahneman identified several heuristics that people use to make decisions, such as:
- **Availability Heuristic**: Estimating the likelihood of events based on their availability in memory.
- **Representativeness Heuristic**: Judging the probability of an event by how much it resembles other events.
- **Anchoring and Adjustment**: Relying heavily on an initial piece of information (the anchor) and adjusting insufficiently from it.

#### 3. **Adaptive Toolbox (Gigerenzer)**
Gigerenzer proposed that humans use an "adaptive toolbox" of heuristics tailored to specific environments, suggesting that heuristics can be highly effective and rational within certain contexts.

### Mathematical Formalism

Consider a decision-maker choosing between actions $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ with payoffs $u(a_i)$. Under perfect rationality, the decision-maker would choose the action that maximizes the expected utility:

$$
a^* = \arg\max_{a_i} E[u(a_i)]
$$

Under bounded rationality, the decision-maker uses a heuristic $H$ that approximates the optimal choice:

$$
a_H = H(\{u(a_1), u(a_2), \ldots, u(a_n)\})
$$

#### Example: Satisficing

In a [[satisficing]] model, the decision-maker sets an aspiration level $A$ and selects the first action that meets or exceeds this level:

$$
a_S = \min \{a_i \mid u(a_i) \geq A\}
$$

#### Example: Quantal Response Equilibrium (QRE)

In QRE, the probability of choosing action $a_i$ is given by:

$$
P(a_i) = \frac{\exp(\lambda \cdot E[u(a_i)])}{\sum_{a_j} \exp(\lambda \cdot E[u(a_j)])}
$$

where $\lambda$ is a parameter reflecting the degree of rationality. As $\lambda \to \infty$, the model converges to the classical Nash equilibrium.

### Conclusion

Bounded rationality provides a more realistic framework for understanding decision-making by acknowledging human cognitive limitations, incomplete information, and the use of heuristics. This approach has broad applications across economics, game theory, organizational behavior, and other fields, offering valuable insights into how people make decisions in complex and uncertain environments. By integrating bounded rationality into theoretical models, we can better predict and influence human behavior in practical settings.

# Bounded Rationality

Bounded rationality is a foundational concept in [[decision theory]] and [[cognitive science]] that acknowledges the inherent limitations of human and artificial decision-makers when operating in complex environments. It represents a departure from idealized [[perfect rationality]] models by incorporating cognitive constraints, computational limitations, and environmental complexity.

## Mathematical Formalization

Bounded rationality can be formalized through several complementary mathematical frameworks:

### 1. Resource-Constrained Optimization

A decision-maker with bounded rationality solves:

$$\max_{a \in A(r)} U(a, s)$$

Where:
- $U(a, s)$ is the utility of action $a$ in state $s$
- $A(r)$ is the set of actions that can be evaluated within resource constraint $r$
- Resources may include computation time, memory, attention, or energy

### 2. Computational Complexity Framework

Bounded rationality acknowledges that some decision problems are computationally intractable:

$$\exists \text{ decision problems } P \text{ such that } P \in \text{NP-hard}$$

Where solving $P$ optimally would require computational resources that scale exponentially with problem size.

### 3. [[Satisficing]] Model

Instead of optimizing, bounded rationality often employs satisficing (a term coined by Herbert Simon):

$$\text{Select } a \text{ such that } U(a, s) \geq \theta$$

Where $\theta$ is an acceptability threshold, rather than seeking the global optimum.

## Cognitive Limitations

Bounded rationality addresses several key cognitive constraints:

### 1. Limited Attention

The [[cognitive bottleneck]] is modeled as:

$$C(t) = \{s_1, s_2, ..., s_k\} \subset S$$

Where $C(t)$ represents the subset of state variables $s_i$ that can be attended to at time $t$, out of the full state space $S$.

### 2. Memory Constraints

Working memory limitations are captured by:

$$M(t) = \{m_1, m_2, ..., m_n\} : |M(t)| \leq K$$

Where $M(t)$ represents the set of memory chunks accessible at time $t$, bounded by capacity $K$ (typically 7Â±2 for humans).

### 3. Computational Budget

The [[computational rationality]] perspective formalizes the trade-off between decision quality and computational cost:

$$\max_{a \in A} U(a, s) - \lambda \cdot \text{comp}(a, s)$$

Where $\text{comp}(a, s)$ represents the computational cost of evaluating action $a$ in state $s$, and $\lambda$ is a parameter balancing decision quality against computational expenditure.

## Heuristics and Approximations

Bounded rationality relies on several classes of efficient approximation strategies:

### 1. [[Heuristic Decision Rules]]

Simple rules that trade optimality for efficiency:

$$h: S \to A \text{ where } \text{complexity}(h) \ll \text{complexity}(f^*)$$

Where $h$ is a heuristic approximation of the optimal decision function $f^*$.

### 2. [[Anytime Algorithms]]

Algorithms that can be interrupted and still provide valid, improving solutions:

$$\text{quality}(a_t) \leq \text{quality}(a_{t+\Delta t})$$

Where $a_t$ is the best action found after computing for time $t$.

### 3. [[Metareasoning]]

The process of reasoning about the reasoning process itself:

$$\max_{c \in C} V(c) - \text{cost}(c)$$

Where $C$ is the set of possible computational strategies, $V(c)$ is the expected value of computational strategy $c$, and $\text{cost}(c)$ is its cost.

## Applications in AI Systems

Bounded rationality principles have influenced several key areas of AI research:

### 1. [[Resource-Aware Machine Learning]]

Models that adapt their computational complexity based on instance difficulty:

$$f(x; \theta, \alpha) \text{ where } \alpha \text{ controls computational allocation}$$

Examples include [[early exit networks]], [[adaptive computation time]], and [[conditional computation]].

### 2. [[Metalearning]]

Systems that learn how to learn efficiently:

$$\phi^* = \arg\min_\phi \mathbb{E}_{T \sim p(T)} \left[ \mathcal{L}(A_\phi, T) \right]$$

Where $A_\phi$ is a learning algorithm parameterized by $\phi$, and $T$ represents tasks drawn from distribution $p(T)$.

### 3. [[Rational Metareasoning]]

Formal frameworks for allocating computational resources optimally:

$$V^*(\text{info}) = \max_c \left\{ V(\text{info}, c) - \text{cost}(c) \right\}$$

Where $V^*(\text{info})$ is the optimal value of information state $\text{info}$.

## Theoretical Connections

Bounded rationality connects to several foundational theoretical frameworks:

### 1. [[Information Theory]]

The cost of acquiring and processing information:

$$I(X; Y) = \sum_{x,y} p(x,y) \log \frac{p(x,y)}{p(x)p(y)}$$

Where $I(X; Y)$ quantifies the mutual information between random variables $X$ and $Y$.

### 2. [[Computational Complexity Theory]]

Formal bounds on problem solvability:

$$\text{PSPACE} \supseteq \text{NP} \supseteq \text{P}$$

Establishing fundamental limits on what can be computed efficiently.

### 3. [[Thermodynamics of Computation]]

Physical limits on computation, following Landauer's principle:

$$\Delta E \geq k_B T \ln(2) \cdot \Delta I$$

Where $\Delta E$ is energy expenditure, $k_B$ is Boltzmann's constant, $T$ is temperature, and $\Delta I$ is information erasure.

## Philosophical Implications

Bounded rationality has profound implications for understanding intelligence:

1. **[[Ecological Rationality]]**: Decision mechanisms are adapted to specific environments rather than being universally optimal
2. **[[Procedural Rationality]]**: The quality of decision processes matters, not just outcomes
3. **[[Cognitive Architectures]]**: The structural organization of cognitive systems fundamentally constrains their capabilities

## Research Frontiers

Current research directions at the intersection of bounded rationality and AI include:

1. **[[Rational Inattention]]**: Formal models of optimal attention allocation under information processing constraints
2. **[[Resource-Rational Analysis]]**: Explaining human cognitive biases as optimal adaptations to resource constraints
3. **[[Computational Rationality]]**: Building AI systems that make optimal use of their computational resources
4. **[[Bounded-Optimal Intelligence]]**: Theoretical frameworks for intelligence that is optimal within its computational bounds

The concept of bounded rationality remains central to understanding the design principles and limitations of both biological and artificial intelligence systems, providing a crucial bridge between idealized theoretical models and practical implementations.
