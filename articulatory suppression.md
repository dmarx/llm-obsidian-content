### Articulatory Suppression

**Definition:** Articulatory suppression refers to a process where individuals are asked to repeat an irrelevant sound or word continuously, which prevents the rehearsal of other verbal material. This technique is commonly used in cognitive psychology to investigate the functioning of working memory, particularly the phonological loop component.

### Mechanism of Articulatory Suppression

The phonological loop, a core component of [[Baddeley's Model of Working Memory|working memory]], consists of two parts:
1. **Phonological Store:** Holds verbal information for a few seconds.
2. **Articulatory Rehearsal Process:** Refreshes the contents of the phonological store to prevent decay.

When an individual engages in articulatory suppression, the articulatory rehearsal process is occupied with repeating the irrelevant sound, thus inhibiting the ability to refresh other verbal information held in the phonological store. This leads to a significant reduction in the capacity to remember and process other verbal information.

### Experimental Evidence

#### Classic Study: Baddeley, Lewis, and Vallar (1984)
One of the foundational studies on articulatory suppression was conducted by Baddeley, Lewis, and Vallar in 1984. They demonstrated that articulatory suppression reduced the phonological similarity effect and the word length effect, which are both indicators of the functioning of the phonological loop.

- **Phonological Similarity Effect:** Normally, lists of phonologically similar items (e.g., "cat," "bat," "hat") are harder to remember than phonologically dissimilar items (e.g., "dog," "pen," "sun"). Articulatory suppression diminishes this effect because it disrupts the phonological encoding process.
  
- **Word Length Effect:** Longer words are typically harder to remember than shorter words. This effect is also reduced under articulatory suppression, as the rehearsal process is hindered.

### Mathematical Modeling

Consider a sequence of $n$ verbal items $\{v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n\}$. In the presence of articulatory suppression, the probability $P_i$ of correctly recalling the $i$-th item can be modeled as:
$$
P_i = P_0 \cdot e^{-\lambda i}
$$
where $P_0$ is the initial recall probability, and $\lambda$ is a decay constant representing the rate at which information is lost without rehearsal. Under articulatory suppression, $\lambda$ increases due to the interruption of the rehearsal process, resulting in a steeper decline in recall probability.

### Applications and Implications

Articulatory suppression is used in various cognitive experiments to understand:
- The capacity limits of verbal working memory.
- The interaction between different components of working memory.
- The role of subvocal rehearsal in language acquisition and development.

By examining the effects of articulatory suppression, researchers gain insights into the mechanisms underlying verbal information processing and the structural organization of working memory.
