title: trace of a product of matrices is invariant under cyclic permutations of the
  product.

>The trace of a product of matrices is invariant under cyclic permutations of the product.


**ASSISTANT**

Indeed, one of the key properties of the trace function, which is particularly useful in matrix algebra and applied in various domains including statistics, physics, and engineering, is that the trace of a product of matrices is invariant under cyclic permutations. This means that if you have a product of matrices, the trace remains the same no matter how you rotate the order of the matrices in the product, as long as the sequence of multiplication remains cyclically consistent.

### Mathematical Description

If you have three matrices \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \), then the trace property states:

$$
\text{tr}(ABC) = \text{tr}(BCA) = \text{tr}(CAB)
$$

This property can be extended to any number of matrices, not just three.

### Proof Concept

The proof of this property relies on the definitions of matrix multiplication and the trace. The trace of a matrix \( A \), denoted as \( \text{tr}(A) \), is the sum of its diagonal elements. For any square matrix \( A \), if \( A = [a_{ij}] \), then:

$$
\text{tr}(A) = \sum_{i=1}^n a_{ii}
$$

Now, consider the product of two matrices, \( AB \), where \( A \) and \( B \) are square matrices of the same dimension. The elements of \( AB \) are given by:

$$
(AB)_{ij} = \sum_{k=1}^n a_{ik} b_{kj}
$$

Thus, the trace of \( AB \) is:

$$
\text{tr}(AB) = \sum_{i=1}^n (AB)_{ii} = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{k=1}^n a_{ik} b_{ki}
$$

This can be rearranged due to the commutative property of summation:

$$
\text{tr}(AB) = \sum_{k=1}^n \sum_{i=1}^n b_{ki} a_{ik} = \text{tr}(BA)
$$

Extending this property to the cyclic permutation of three matrices \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \):

$$
\text{tr}(ABC) = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n \sum_{k=1}^n a_{ij} b_{jk} c_{ki}
$$

By reordering the summations, this can be shown to be equal to:

$$
\text{tr}(BCA) = \text{tr}(CAB)
$$

### Applications

This property is extremely useful in simplifying expressions in theoretical derivations, particularly in physics (such as in quantum mechanics where operators in trace expressions can often be permuted cyclically) and in control theory, where it is used in feedback loop analysis. It also plays a crucial role in proving results in linear algebra and multivariate statistics, such as in deriving the properties of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, or in simplifying expressions involving matrix derivatives.

Understanding this property provides deep insights into the symmetry and the underlying structure of matrix operations, often leading to more intuitive understanding and simplifications in complex algebraic manipulations.
