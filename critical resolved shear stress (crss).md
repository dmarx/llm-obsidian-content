# Critical Resolved Shear Stress (CRSS)

The Critical Resolved Shear Stress (CRSS) is a fundamental concept in the study of [[plastic deformation]] of crystalline materials. It represents the minimum shear stress required to initiate slip on a particular slip system within a crystal. Understanding CRSS is essential for predicting the onset of [[plastic deformation]] and for designing materials with specific mechanical properties.

## Fundamental Concepts

### Slip Systems

A slip system in a crystal consists of a slip plane and a slip direction. The slip plane is the crystallographic plane along which dislocation motion occurs, and the slip direction is the direction within that plane in which dislocation motion is most favorable. The combination of these two defines the slip system.

### Schmid's Law

Schmid's law relates the applied stress to the shear stress resolved on a slip system. According to Schmid's law, the resolved shear stress (\( \tau \)) on a slip system is given by:

$$
\tau = \sigma \cos \phi \cos \lambda
$$

where:
- \( \sigma \) is the applied normal stress.
- \( \phi \) is the angle between the applied stress direction and the slip direction.
- \( \lambda \) is the angle between the applied stress direction and the normal to the slip plane.

### Critical Resolved Shear Stress (CRSS)

The CRSS (\( \tau_{crss} \)) is the minimum resolved shear stress required to initiate slip on a slip system. For a crystal to begin deforming plastically, the resolved shear stress on at least one of its slip systems must reach the CRSS.

## Mathematical Formulation

### Determining CRSS

To determine whether a crystal will deform plastically under an applied stress, we use Schmid's law:

$$
\tau = \sigma \cos \phi \cos \lambda
$$

Plastic deformation begins when the resolved shear stress \( \tau \) reaches the CRSS (\( \tau_{crss} \)):

$$
\tau_{crss} = \sigma \cos \phi \cos \lambda
$$

Rearranging this equation to solve for the applied stress \( \sigma \) gives:

$$
\sigma = \frac{\tau_{crss}}{\cos \phi \cos \lambda}
$$

### Slip Systems in Common Crystal Structures

#### Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) Crystals

FCC crystals, like aluminum, copper, and gold, typically have 12 slip systems: {111} slip planes and \( \langle 110 \rangle \) slip directions.

#### Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) Crystals

BCC crystals, like iron and tungsten, have 48 possible slip systems: {110}, {112}, and {123} slip planes and \( \langle 111 \rangle \) slip directions. However, the actual active slip systems depend on the temperature and the applied stress state.

#### Hexagonal Close-Packed (HCP) Crystals

HCP crystals, like titanium and magnesium, have fewer slip systems compared to FCC and BCC structures. Common slip systems in HCP crystals are the basal {0001} planes with \( \langle 11\bar{2}0 \rangle \) slip directions.

## Practical Implications

### Material Strength

The CRSS is a key parameter in determining the yield strength of single crystals. Materials with higher CRSS values require greater applied stresses to initiate [[plastic deformation]], making them stronger.

### Anisotropy in Crystals

Crystals exhibit anisotropy in their mechanical properties due to the directional dependence of slip systems. The CRSS helps in understanding and predicting the anisotropic behavior of materials under different loading conditions.

### Designing Alloys

By manipulating the microstructure and composition of alloys, engineers can influence the CRSS of the constituent phases. This allows for the design of materials with tailored mechanical properties for specific applications.

## Example Calculation: Determining CRSS

Consider a single crystal of aluminum (FCC structure) subjected to a tensile stress of \( \sigma = 50 \, \text{MPa} \). The slip system under consideration has angles \( \phi = 45^\circ \) and \( \lambda = 45^\circ \) with respect to the applied stress.

Using Schmid's law, the resolved shear stress \( \tau \) is:

$$
\tau = \sigma \cos \phi \cos \lambda
$$

Substituting the given values:

$$
\tau = 50 \times \cos(45^\circ) \times \cos(45^\circ)
$$

Since \( \cos(45^\circ) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \):

$$
\tau = 50 \times \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \times \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)
$$

$$
\tau = 50 \times \frac{1}{2} = 25 \, \text{MPa}
$$

If the CRSS for aluminum is \( \tau_{crss} = 20 \, \text{MPa} \), then the resolved shear stress (\( \tau = 25 \, \text{MPa} \)) exceeds the CRSS, indicating that slip will occur on the considered slip system.

## Conclusion

The Critical Resolved Shear Stress (CRSS) is a fundamental parameter in understanding the [[plastic deformation]] behavior of crystalline materials. By applying Schmid's law and considering the crystal structure and slip systems, engineers and scientists can predict the onset of [[plastic deformation]] and design materials with specific mechanical properties. Understanding CRSS is essential for material selection, alloy design, and predicting the mechanical behavior of single crystals under various loading conditions.
