Fractal structures are fascinating mathematical sets that exhibit a repeating pattern at every scale. They are examples of complex structures arising from simple rules, and they have applications across various fields including physics, biology, art, and finance. A hallmark of fractals is their self-similarity; parts of the fractal resemble the whole. This characteristic can be either exactly self-similar, as in mathematical fractals, or statistically self-similar, as seen in natural phenomena.

### Mathematical Definition

At its core, a fractal can be defined mathematically through recursive processes or iterated function systems (IFS). The concept of dimensionality is pivotal in understanding fractals. Unlike traditional geometric shapes (e.g., lines, squares, cubes) that have integer dimensions (1, 2, and 3, respectively), fractals are characterized by non-integer Hausdorff dimensions, indicating their complexity.

The Hausdorff dimension $D$ of a fractal is defined using the concept of similarity dimension, for a structure that can be divided into $N$ parts, each scaled down by a factor of $r$ from the original, as follows:

$$D = \frac{\log N}{\log (1/r)}$$

This equation provides insight into the non-integer dimensions of fractals, underscoring their intricate structure that fills the space more than a line (dimension 1) but less than a plane (dimension 2).

### Examples of Fractal Structures

1. **[[Mandelbrot Set]]**: Perhaps the most famous fractal, generated by iterating the complex quadratic polynomial $z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c$, where $z$ and $c$ are complex numbers. The set consists of values of $c$ for which the orbit of $0$ under iteration remains bounded. The boundary of the Mandelbrot set exhibits an infinitely complex, self-similar structure.

2. **[[Sierpinski Triangle]]**: This is a classic example of a fractal generated by recursively subdividing a triangle into smaller triangles. Starting with an equilateral triangle, the process involves removing the upside-down triangle in the middle, leaving three equilateral triangles, and then repeating the process for each smaller triangle ad infinitum.

3. **[[Koch Snowflake]]**: Generated by starting with an equilateral triangle and recursively altering each line segment. The middle third of each segment is replaced with two segments that form an equilateral bump. This process leads to a figure with an infinitely long perimeter while enclosing a finite area, showcasing the paradoxical nature of fractals.

4. **[[Julia Sets]]**: Like the Mandelbrot set, Julia sets are formed by iterating a complex function. However, whereas the Mandelbrot set’s boundary is formed by considering the behavior of the function at each point in the complex plane, Julia sets examine the fate of points under iteration from a single complex quadratic polynomial, given different initial conditions.

### Applications

Fractals have found applications in numerous fields, illustrating their vast interdisciplinary impact:

- **Physics**: Fractals are used in the study of chaos theory, turbulence, and pattern formation.
- **Biology**: The branching patterns of trees and veins, the structure of lungs, and the distribution of galaxies are examples of fractal patterns in nature.
- **Computer Graphics**: Fractal algorithms are used to create realistic landscapes, clouds, and other natural phenomena in computer-generated imagery (CGI).
- **Finance**: Fractal market analysis looks at the self-similar patterns in asset price movements over time.

Fractal geometry offers a unique perspective on the complexity in nature and mathematics, bridging the gap between the abstract and the concrete, and providing a powerful tool for understanding the intricacies of the world around us.
