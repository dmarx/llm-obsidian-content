title: adaptive extensions of sgd

**USER**

adaptive extensions of SGD


**ASSISTANT**

Adaptive extensions of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) dynamically adjust the learning rates based on the properties of the data and gradients during training. These methods aim to improve the convergence speed and stability, especially in scenarios where the data or the loss landscape is highly heterogeneous. Some of the most prominent adaptive SGD variants include AdaGrad, RMSProp, and Adam.

### 1. AdaGrad (Adaptive Gradient Algorithm)

AdaGrad adapts the learning rate for each parameter based on the historical gradients. Parameters with larger gradients receive smaller updates, while parameters with smaller gradients receive larger updates.

#### Algorithm

Let \( g_t \) be the gradient at iteration \( t \).

1. **Initialization**: Initialize \(\theta_0\) and set \( G_0 = 0 \) (a vector of zeros).
2. **Update**:
   \[
   G_t = G_{t-1} + g_t^2,
   \]
   where \( G_t \) is the accumulated sum of squares of past gradients (element-wise).
   \[
   \theta_{t+1} = \theta_t - \frac{\eta}{\sqrt{G_t + \epsilon}} g_t,
   \]
   where \(\eta\) is the initial learning rate and \(\epsilon\) is a small constant to prevent division by zero.

#### Advantages

- Automatically scales the learning rate for each parameter based on the gradients.
- Effective for sparse data.

#### Disadvantages

- The learning rate can become excessively small due to the accumulation of squared gradients, causing slow convergence.

### 2. RMSProp (Root Mean Square Propagation)

RMSProp modifies AdaGrad to address the issue of diminishing learning rates. It does so by using a moving average of squared gradients to normalize the gradients.

#### Algorithm

1. **Initialization**: Initialize \(\theta_0\) and set \( E[g^2]_0 = 0 \) (a vector of zeros).
2. **Update**:
   \[
   E[g^2]_t = \gamma E[g^2]_{t-1} + (1 - \gamma) g_t^2,
   \]
   where \( E[g^2]_t \) is the exponentially weighted moving average of squared gradients and \( \gamma \) is the decay rate.
   \[
   \theta_{t+1} = \theta_t - \frac{\eta}{\sqrt{E[g^2]_t + \epsilon}} g_t,
   \]
   where \(\eta\) is the learning rate and \(\epsilon\) is a small constant.

#### Advantages

- Prevents the learning rate from becoming too small by using a moving average.
- More stable convergence compared to AdaGrad.

#### Disadvantages

- Requires tuning of the decay rate parameter \(\gamma\).

### 3. Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation)

Adam combines the ideas of RMSProp and momentum. It computes adaptive learning rates for each parameter and includes momentum by maintaining moving averages of both the gradients and their squared values.

#### Algorithm

1. **Initialization**: Initialize \(\theta_0\) and set \( m_0 = 0 \), \( v_0 = 0 \) (vectors of zeros). Set \(\beta_1 = 0.9\) and \(\beta_2 = 0.999\).
2. **Update**:
   \[
   m_t = \beta_1 m_{t-1} + (1 - \beta_1) g_t,
   \]
   \[
   v_t = \beta_2 v_{t-1} + (1 - \beta_2) g_t^2,
   \]
   where \( m_t \) and \( v_t \) are the moving averages of the gradients and the squared gradients, respectively.
   \[
   \hat{m}_t = \frac{m_t}{1 - \beta_1^t}, \quad \hat{v}_t = \frac{v_t}{1 - \beta_2^t},
   \]
   where \(\hat{m}_t\) and \(\hat{v}_t\) are bias-corrected estimates.
   \[
   \theta_{t+1} = \theta_t - \frac{\eta}{\sqrt{\hat{v}_t} + \epsilon} \hat{m}_t,
   \]
   where \(\eta\) is the learning rate and \(\epsilon\) is a small constant.

#### Advantages

- Combines the benefits of RMSProp and momentum.
- Typically performs well across a wide range of problems and datasets.
- Automatically adjusts learning rates based on the first and second moments of the gradients.

#### Disadvantages

- Requires tuning of multiple hyperparameters (\(\beta_1\), \(\beta_2\), and \(\epsilon\)).
- Can sometimes perform poorly in highly non-stationary problems.

### Summary

Adaptive SGD variants like AdaGrad, RMSProp, and Adam significantly enhance the basic SGD algorithm by adjusting learning rates dynamically based on historical gradient information. These methods improve convergence speed and stability, making them particularly effective for training deep neural networks and other large-scale machine learning models.
