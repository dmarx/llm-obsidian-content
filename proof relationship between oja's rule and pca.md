## Proof: Relationship Between Oja's Rule and PCA

### Introduction

Oja's rule is a modification of Hebbian learning that incorporates a normalization term to prevent the unbounded growth of synaptic weights. This rule can be understood as an online algorithm for Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Here, we provide a detailed proof and intuitive explanation of how Oja's rule converges to the principal component of the input data distribution.

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

PCA is a statistical method used to identify the directions (principal components) in which the data varies the most. The first principal component is the eigenvector of the data covariance matrix corresponding to the largest eigenvalue.

### Oja's Rule

Oja's rule updates the synaptic weights as follows:

$$
\Delta \mathbf{w} = \eta \, y \, (\mathbf{x} - y \, \mathbf{w})
$$

where:
- \( \mathbf{w} \) is the weight vector,
- \( \mathbf{x} \) is the input vector,
- \( y = \mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{x} \) is the output of the neuron (projection of \( \mathbf{x} \) onto \( \mathbf{w} \)),
- \( \eta \) is the learning rate.

### Objective

To show that the weights \( \mathbf{w} \) updated by Oja's rule converge to the first principal component of the input data \( \mathbf{x} \).

### Proof Outline

1. **Express Oja's Rule in Terms of Expected Values**:
   \[
   \Delta \mathbf{w} = \eta \, y \, (\mathbf{x} - y \, \mathbf{w})
   \]
   Replace \( y \) with \( \mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{x} \):
   \[
   \Delta \mathbf{w} = \eta \, (\mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{x}) \, (\mathbf{x} - (\mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{x}) \, \mathbf{w})
   \]

2. **Expectation Over the Input Data Distribution**:
   Consider the expected change in \( \mathbf{w} \):
   \[
   \mathbb{E}[\Delta \mathbf{w}] = \eta \, \mathbb{E}[(\mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{x}) \, (\mathbf{x} - (\mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{x}) \, \mathbf{w})]
   \]

3. **Expand the Expectation**:
   \[
   \mathbb{E}[\Delta \mathbf{w}] = \eta \, \left( \mathbb{E}[(\mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{x}) \, \mathbf{x}] - \mathbb{E}[(\mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{x})^2] \, \mathbf{w} \right)
   \]

4. **Covariance Matrix and Principal Component**:
   Define the covariance matrix \( \mathbf{C} = \mathbb{E}[\mathbf{x} \mathbf{x}^T] \). The principal component \( \mathbf{u}_1 \) is the eigenvector of \( \mathbf{C} \) corresponding to the largest eigenvalue \( \lambda_1 \). 

5. **Eigenvalue Relationship**:
   For the principal component:
   \[
   \mathbf{C} \mathbf{u}_1 = \lambda_1 \mathbf{u}_1
   \]

6. **Expected Value Substitutions**:
   \[
   \mathbb{E}[(\mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{x}) \, \mathbf{x}] = \mathbf{C} \mathbf{w}
   \]
   \[
   \mathbb{E}[(\mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{x})^2] = \mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{C} \mathbf{w}
   \]

7. **Combine and Simplify**:
   \[
   \mathbb{E}[\Delta \mathbf{w}] = \eta \, (\mathbf{C} \mathbf{w} - (\mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{C} \mathbf{w}) \, \mathbf{w})
   \]

8. **Gradient Ascent on Rayleigh Quotient**:
   The Rayleigh quotient \( R(\mathbf{w}) \) for the covariance matrix \( \mathbf{C} \) is given by:
   \[
   R(\mathbf{w}) = \frac{\mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{C} \mathbf{w}}{\mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{w}}
   \]
   The gradient of the Rayleigh quotient with respect to \( \mathbf{w} \) is:
   \[
   \nabla R(\mathbf{w}) = \frac{2}{\mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{w}} \left( \mathbf{C} \mathbf{w} - (\mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{C} \mathbf{w}) \frac{\mathbf{w}}{\mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{w}} \right)
   \]

9. **Gradient Ascent Dynamics**:
   Oja's rule can be seen as a stochastic gradient ascent method on the Rayleigh quotient, which seeks to maximize the variance captured by \( \mathbf{w} \). The normalization term ensures that \( \mathbf{w} \) remains a unit vector.

### Intuitive Explanation

- Oja's rule modifies Hebbian learning by adding a normalization term that prevents the weight vector from growing indefinitely.
- The weight vector \( \mathbf{w} \) is updated based on the projection of the input \( \mathbf{x} \) onto \( \mathbf{w} \), adjusted to prevent runaway growth.
- Over many iterations, this update rule aligns \( \mathbf{w} \) with the direction of maximum variance in the data, i.e., the first principal component.
- The normalization term ensures that \( \mathbf{w} \) converges to a stable solution, capturing the direction of the largest eigenvector of the covariance matrix.

### Conclusion

Oja's rule provides an efficient online algorithm for performing PCA. By preventing the unbounded growth of weights and focusing on the covariance of input data, Oja's rule ensures that the synaptic weights converge to the principal component of the data. This relationship highlights the powerful connection between neural learning rules and statistical methods for data analysis.
