**ASSISTANT**

Eric Schwarz's model of viable living systems offers a comprehensive framework for understanding how complex systems maintain viability through self-organization, adaptation, and autonomy. Building upon and extending concepts from [[Stafford Beer's Viable System Model]] and [[Humberto Maturana's autopoiesis]], Schwarz introduces the notion of **autogenesis**—self-creation—as a critical component for system viability.

### Core Components of Schwarz's Model

Schwarz's model is structured around **three interdependent planes**, each representing a distinct ontological domain:

1. **Plane of Energy (Physical Structures):**
   - Encompasses the tangible, material aspects of the system, including physical components and metabolic processes.
   - Processes such as **morphogenesis** (formation and development of structures) and **vortices** (cyclic exchanges of energy and matter) operate within this plane.

2. **Plane of Information (Relational Structures):**
   - Pertains to the informational and relational dynamics, including communication pathways and feedback mechanisms.
   - Key processes include **homeostasis** (maintenance of internal stability) and **self-reference** (the system's ability to reflect upon and adjust its own operations).

3. **Plane of Totality (Existential Structures):**
   - Represents the holistic identity and purpose of the system, integrating physical and informational aspects into a coherent whole.
   - Processes such as **autopoiesis** (self-production) and **autogenesis** (self-creation) are central to this plane.

### The Six Cycles of Viability

Schwarz identifies **six fundamental cycles** that interconnect these planes, ensuring the system's viability:

1. **Morphogenesis (Cycle 1):**
   - Involves the generation and development of the system's physical structures.
   - Operates within the Plane of Energy.

2. **Vortices (Cycle 2):**
   - Pertains to the cyclical processes that facilitate energy and matter exchanges, sustaining the system's metabolism.
   - Also situated in the Plane of Energy.

3. **Homeostasis (Cycle 3):**
   - Ensures internal stability through regulatory feedback loops, maintaining equilibrium amidst external fluctuations.
   - Functions within the Plane of Information.

4. **Autopoiesis (Cycle 4):**
   - Describes the system's capacity to reproduce and maintain its components, preserving its identity over time.
   - Bridges the Plane of Energy and the Plane of Totality.

5. **Self-Reference (Cycle 5):**
   - Enables the system to observe and modify its own behavior, enhancing adaptability and learning.
   - Operates within the Plane of Information.

6. **Autogenesis (Cycle 6):**
   - Represents the system's ability to create its own governing principles and objectives, achieving full autonomy.
   - Integrates all three planes,
