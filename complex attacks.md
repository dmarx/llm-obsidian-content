**ASSISTANT**

The initial IED is used to damage or disable a vehicle, drawing a response from medical or EOD units.
- **Second Layer**: Secondary IEDs are triggered to target the rescue teams, often placed at a distance to avoid initial detection.
- **Third Layer**: Tertiary IEDs or ambushes target the response units arriving after the second explosion.

#### b. **IEDs with Enhanced Payloads**
Insurgents may use **chemical, biological, or radiological** materials to create **CBRNE (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosive)** IEDs. These devices aim to cause **long-term contamination** or **panic** in addition to the immediate explosive damage.

#### c. **Anti-Disarmament (Anti-Tamper) Techniques**
IEDs are often equipped with **[[anti-tamper mechanisms]]** to prevent disarmament. These include:
- **Anti-lift devices**: IEDs detonate when moved or lifted.
- **Vibration sensors**: Detonate the IED when tampering or even slight movements are detected.
- **Secondary IEDs**: Designed to target EOD teams during disarmament attempts.

### 4. **Countermeasures to Insurgent IED Tactics**

#### a. **Intelligence and Surveillance**
Intelligence gathering is crucial in identifying IED networks and tracking insurgent bomb-making activities. Surveillance of supply lines and **human intelligence (HUMINT)** can help disrupt IED production before deployment.

#### b. **Route Clearance Operations**
Military units use **route clearance patrols** to detect and neutralize IEDs along known routes before convoys pass through. These patrols use **ground-penetrating radar**, **metal detectors**, and **IED jammers** to detect and neutralize hidden explosives.

#### c. **Electronic Countermeasures (ECM)**
ECM devices, also known as **IED jammers**, are used to block radio frequencies that may be used to detonate IEDs remotely. These systems disrupt the signals used by insurgents to trigger IEDs through mobile phones, radios, or garage door openers.

#### d. **EOD Teams and Robots**
**Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD)** teams play a critical role in safely disarming and disposing of IEDs. They use **robots**, X-ray equipment, and other advanced technologies to inspect and neutralize IEDs from a safe distance.

#### e. **IED Awareness Training**
Educating military personnel on IED threats, identification, and procedures for handling suspected devices is key to mitigating IED attacks. Regular training helps soldiers recognize the signs of IEDs and avoid common insurgent traps.

complex attacks


**ASSISTANT**

**Complex attacks** involve the use of multiple, coordinated tactics to overwhelm a target and maximize damage, casualties, and confusion. These attacks typically integrate **Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs)** with **small-arms fire**, **rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs)**, **snipers**, or **mortars** to trap, incapacitate, or destroy a military unit or convoy. Complex attacks are a hallmark of **asymmetric warfare**, particularly in insurgency and guerilla tactics, where insurgents use minimal resources to confront a superior military force.

Complex attacks often rely on **deception**, **ambush**, and the **sequential use of different types of weaponry**, allowing insurgents to control when and how the battle unfolds. These attacks are designed to catch the enemy off-guard, forcing them to split their attention between multiple threats.

### 1. **Components of a Complex Attack**

A complex attack generally consists of the following coordinated elements:

#### a. **IEDs to Initiate the Attack**
The attack typically begins with one or more **IEDs** that are strategically placed to cause immediate damage and chaos. IEDs may be buried on a roadside, concealed in debris, or hidden inside vehicles.

- **Tactic**: The **IED blast** disables the lead vehicle in a convoy or hits foot patrols, creating confusion and stopping the convoy in a **kill zone**.
- **Objective**: The primary goal is to immobilize the target, slow down reinforcements, and create an initial **shock**. This also forces the targeted unit into a **vulnerable position**, where they are exposed to follow-up attacks.
- **Types of IEDs** used:
  - **Roadside IEDs**: Buried along roads and triggered by pressure plates, remote controls, or tripwires.
  - **Vehicle-Borne IEDs (VBIEDs)**: Used to breach security perimeters or target moving convoys.
  - **Secondary IEDs**: Used to target responding EOD teams, medics, or reinforcements.

#### b. **Direct Fire and Ambushes**
Once the IED has detonated, insurgents often open fire on the immobilized unit using **small arms**, **machine guns**, **RPGs**, or **snipers**.

- **Tactic**: Insurgents position themselves in **concealed locations** (rooftops, tree lines, or behind cover) to fire at the convoy or dismounted troops. **Enfilading fire** (fire along the length of a target) and **crossfire** are used to trap the unit in a kill zone.
- **Objective**: The goal is to maximize casualties and prevent an organized counter-attack. The **shock and confusion** from the initial IED explosion make it difficult for the unit to respond effectively to the ambush.
- **Techniques**:
  - **RPGs** are used to target vehicles, focusing on lightly armored or vulnerable points.
  - **Snipers** target high-value personnel, such as vehicle commanders, medics, or radio operators, to further disorient the unit.
  - **Machine gun teams** provide suppressive fire to pin down survivors and prevent escape or counter-maneuvers.

#### c. **Secondary IEDs**
Secondary IEDs are used to target **rescue teams**, **medics**, or **reinforcements** who respond to the initial blast and ambush.

- **Tactic**: After the initial IED and ambush, insurgents will place secondary IEDs along likely routes of approach or in positions where medics and reinforcements are expected to provide assistance.
- **Objective**: To inflict additional casualties and disrupt any attempts to recover wounded personnel or repair damaged vehicles. Secondary IEDs also **delay counterattacks** and force responders to be more cautious, buying insurgents time to escape.
- **Techniques**:
  - **Hidden secondary IEDs**: These can be concealed in debris or alongside roads where backup forces are expected to arrive.
  - **Anti-personnel IEDs**: These may contain shrapnel to maximize damage to dismounted troops and medics.

#### d. **Blocking Forces and Escape Routes**
Insurgents often position **blocking forces** to cut off escape routes or to prevent reinforcements from reaching the ambush site.

- **Tactic**: Blocking forces use small arms or IEDs to block roads, bridges, or passageways, trapping the target unit in the kill zone. They may also position obstacles such as burning vehicles or debris to funnel the enemy into preselected kill zones.
- **Objective**: Prevent the target from escaping the kill zone and ensure the unit remains exposed to further attacks.
- **Techniques**:
  - **Roadblocks**: Using burning vehicles, debris, or other obstacles to block escape routes.
  - **Snipers** and **machine gun teams** positioned to cover escape routes and pick off fleeing personnel.

#### e. **Mortar or Indirect Fire**
Insurgents sometimes employ **indirect fire** with **mortars**, **rockets**, or **artillery** to provide additional support to the ambush. This adds another layer of complexity to the attack, further overwhelming the target.

- **Tactic**: Mortars are used to hit static positions or dismounted troops that take cover after the IED explosion. Rockets or mortars can also target the vehicles at the rear of the convoy, preventing an organized retreat.
- **Objective**: To force the target to stay under cover, causing confusion and panic, and to hit backup forces or additional convoy vehicles that may try to respond.
- **Techniques**:
  - **Timed mortar attacks** to coincide with the initial IED explosion and small arms ambush.
  - **Harassing fire** to prevent soldiers from regrouping or returning fire effectively.

#### f. **Withdrawal and Escape**
A key feature of insurgent complex attacks is their ability to execute **rapid withdrawal** after the ambush. Insurgents often pre-plan **escape routes** and use cover to retreat once the attack has caused significant damage.

- **Tactic**: After launching the ambush, insurgents withdraw through predetermined escape routes to avoid retaliation. They use the terrain (mountains, urban environments, tunnels) to evade pursuit and blend back into the local population.
- **Objective**: Avoid direct engagement with a superior force and minimize insurgent casualties. The focus is on **hit-and-run tactics**, achieving their objectives and escaping quickly.
- **Techniques**:
  - **Dispersed escape routes**: Insurgents split into smaller groups to avoid being tracked or neutralized as a single unit.
  - **Booby-trapped retreat routes**: Placing additional IEDs or booby traps along likely pursuit routes to slow down or kill any units attempting to follow them.

### 2. **Insurgent Planning and Preparation for Complex Attacks**

Complex attacks are meticulously planned and rely on detailed knowledge of the target, the terrain, and the behavior of military forces. The success of these attacks depends on effective coordination between insurgent units, proper timing, and exploiting weaknesses in the enemy’s defenses.

#### a. **Reconnaissance and Target Selection**
Insurgents conduct **reconnaissance** to identify weak points in patrol patterns, convoy routes, and military outposts. This allows them to identify the best places to plant IEDs and position their forces for maximum impact.

- **Target selection** focuses on:
  - **High-value targets** such as military convoys, supply lines, government officials, or symbolic structures.
  - **Routine patrols or convoys** that take predictable routes, allowing for pre-positioned IEDs and ambushes.
  - **Vulnerable or isolated units** that are far from reinforcements.

#### b. **Coordination and Timing**
Complex attacks require precise timing and coordination between different insurgent groups or cells. Communication and **chain of command** are critical to ensure that the attack unfolds in a synchronized manner.

- **Communication**: Insurgents may use radios, cell phones, or even runners to coordinate the timing of IEDs, ambushes, and mortar strikes.
- **Chain of command**: A designated commander oversees the attack and ensures that all elements (IED, direct fire, and withdrawal) are executed according to plan.

#### c. **Use of Local Terrain**
Insurgents use their **knowledge of the terrain** to plan ambushes and escape routes. They may set up in urban areas with narrow streets, mountainous regions with good cover, or dense forests where they can blend in with the environment.

- **Natural cover** such as hills, buildings, or vegetation provides concealment for ambushing units.
- **Urban areas** allow insurgents to hide among the civilian population, making it harder for military forces to pursue them.

#### d. **Counterintelligence and Deception**
Insurgents may use **deception** or **decoy tactics** to lure military forces into an ambush. False information, decoy IEDs, or fake roadblocks can mislead the enemy and force them into more vulnerable positions.

- **False intelligence**: Insurgents may leak false information to lure a convoy or patrol into a kill zone.
- **Decoy IEDs**: Placing visible but fake IEDs to divert EOD teams, leaving real IEDs concealed nearby.

### 3. **Countermeasures Against Complex Attacks**

Countering complex attacks requires a combination of **tactics, technology, and intelligence** to anticipate and neutralize insurgent strategies. Military forces need to adapt to the evolving nature of these ambushes by implementing robust counter-IED strategies and increasing situational awareness.

#### a. **Route Clearance and IED Detection**
**Route clearance teams** equipped
