### Vector Field

A **vector [[field]]** is a mathematical construct that assigns a vector to each point in a subset of space. Vector fields are used in various areas of mathematics and physics to model quantities that have both magnitude and direction and vary from point to point in a domain.

#### Formal Definition

Let $U$ be an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$. A vector [[field]] $\mathbf{F}$ on $U$ is a function that assigns to each point $\mathbf{x} \in U$ a vector $\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{x}) \in \mathbb{R}^n$. Formally,
$$
\mathbf{F}: U \to \mathbb{R}^n, \quad \mathbf{x} \mapsto \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{x}).
$$

In coordinates, if $\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)$, then the vector [[field]] $\mathbf{F}$ can be written as:
$$
\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{x}) = (F_1(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n), F_2(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n), \ldots, F_n(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)).
$$

#### Examples

1. **Vector Field in $\mathbb{R}^2$**:
   - A common example is the velocity [[field]] of a fluid flow in two dimensions. If $\mathbf{x} = (x, y)$, a vector [[field]] $\mathbf{F}$ could represent the velocity at each point:
     $$
     \mathbf{F}(x, y) = (u(x, y), v(x, y)).
     $$

2. **Gravitational Field**:
   - In three-dimensional space, the gravitational [[field]] around a mass $m$ at the origin is given by:
     $$ 
     \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{x}) = -G \frac{m}{|\mathbf{x}|^3} \mathbf{x},
     $$
     where $G$ is the gravitational constant and $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^3$.

3. **Electric Field**:
   - The electric [[field]] due to a point charge $q$ at the origin in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is:
     $$ 
     \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) = k_e \frac{q}{|\mathbf{x}|^3} \mathbf{x},
     $$
     where $k_e$ is Coulomb's constant.

#### Visual Representation

Vector fields are often visualized using arrows to represent the vectors at various points in space. The length and direction of each arrow indicate the magnitude and direction of the vector at that point.

#### Properties

1. **Gradient Field**:
   - A vector [[field]] $\mathbf{F}$ is called a **gradient [[field]]** or **conservative [[field]]** if there exists a scalar potential function $\phi$ such that $\mathbf{F} = \nabla \phi$. This means that $\mathbf{F}$ is the gradient of some scalar function $\phi$.

2. **Divergence**:
   - The divergence of a vector [[field]] $\mathbf{F}$, denoted $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}$, is a scalar [[field]] that measures the rate of change of density of the vector [[field]]. In $\mathbb{R}^3$ with $\mathbf{F} = (F_1, F_2, F_3)$,
     $$
     \nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} = \frac{\partial F_1}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial F_2}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial F_3}{\partial z}.
     $$

3. **Curl**:
   - The curl of a vector [[field]] $\mathbf{F}$, denoted $\nabla \times \mathbf{F}$, is a vector [[field]] that measures the rotation or swirling strength of the original vector [[field]]. In $\mathbb{R}^3$,
     $$
     \nabla \times \mathbf{F} = \left( \frac{\partial F_3}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial F_2}{\partial z}, \frac{\partial F_1}{\partial z} - \frac{\partial F_3}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial F_2}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial F_1}{\partial y} \right).
     $$

#### Applications

- **Fluid Dynamics**: Vector fields model fluid flow, representing velocity fields and streamlines.
- **Electromagnetism**: Electric and magnetic fields are vector fields. Maxwell's equations describe how these fields behave and interact.
- **Gravitational Fields**: The gravitational force [[field]] around celestial bodies can be represented as a vector [[field]].
- **Differential Equations**: Solutions to systems of differential equations can be interpreted as vector fields, describing how solutions evolve over time.
