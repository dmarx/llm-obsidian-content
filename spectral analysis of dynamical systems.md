Spectral Analysis of Dynamical Systems


**ASSISTANT**

**Spectral Analysis of Dynamical Systems** involves studying the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of operators associated with the system's evolution. This analysis provides insights into the long-term behavior, stability, and qualitative dynamics of the system. The key operators in this context are the Koopman operator and the Perron-Frobenius operator.

### Key Operators in Spectral Analysis

1. **Koopman Operator**: Describes the evolution of observables (functions of the state).
2. **Perron-Frobenius Operator**: Describes the evolution of probability densities.

### Koopman Operator

The **Koopman operator** $\mathcal{K}$ is a linear but infinite-dimensional operator that acts on observables $g: \mathbb{X} \to \mathbb{C}$ of a dynamical system with state space $\mathbb{X}$ and flow map $\varphi^t: \mathbb{X} \to \mathbb{X}$. For a discrete-time system with map $\varphi$, the Koopman operator is defined as:
$$
(\mathcal{K} g)(x) = g(\varphi(x)).
```

### Perron-Frobenius Operator

The **Perron-Frobenius operator** $\mathcal{P}$ acts on a density function $\rho(x)$ and describes how this density evolves under the map $\varphi: \mathbb{X} \to \mathbb{X}$. For a discrete-time system, it is defined as:
$$
(\mathcal{P} \rho)(y) = \sum_{x \in \varphi^{-1}(y)} \frac{\rho(x)}{|\det D\varphi(x)|}.
```

### Spectral Properties

#### Eigenvalues and Eigenfunctions

- **Koopman Operator**: An eigenfunction $\phi$ with eigenvalue $\lambda$ satisfies:
  $$
  \mathcal{K} \phi = \lambda \phi.
  $$
  This implies $\phi(\varphi(x)) = \lambda \phi(x)$, meaning $\phi$ evolves by a factor of $\lambda$ under the dynamics.

- **Perron-Frobenius Operator**: An eigenfunction $\rho$ with eigenvalue $\mu$ satisfies:
  $$
  \mathcal{P} \rho = \mu \rho.
  $$
  This means $\rho(x)$ evolves by a factor of $\mu$ under the map $\varphi$.

#### Spectral Decomposition

For a Koopman operator $\mathcal{K}$ with eigenvalues $\{\lambda_j\}$ and corresponding eigenfunctions $\{\phi_j\}$, any observable $g$ can be decomposed (in theory) as:
$$
g(x) = \sum_j c_j \phi_j(x),
$$
where $c_j$ are coefficients. The evolution of $g$ is then:
$$
(\mathcal{K}^t g)(x) = \sum_j c_j \lambda_j^t \phi_j(x).
```

### Invariant Measures and Functions

- **Invariant Measure**: A density $\rho_{\text{inv}}$ is invariant under $\mathcal{P}$ if $\mathcal{P} \rho_{\text{inv}} = \rho_{\text{inv}}$. This corresponds to a steady-state distribution of the system.
- **Invariant Function**: A function $\phi_{\text{inv}}$ is invariant under $\mathcal{K}$ if $\mathcal{K} \phi_{\text{inv}} = \phi_{\text{inv}}$. This means the function does not change under the dynamics.

### Decay of Correlations

The spectral gap, which is the difference between the largest eigenvalue (typically 1) and the second largest eigenvalue, indicates the rate at which correlations decay in the system. A larger spectral gap implies faster mixing and decay of correlations.

### Applications

1. **Ergodic Theory**: Understanding invariant measures and ergodic properties.
2. **Fluid Dynamics**: Analyzing coherent structures and mixing properties in fluid flows.
3. **Control Theory**: Designing controllers based on the spectral properties of the system.
4. **Machine Learning**: Feature extraction and dimensionality reduction using spectral methods like Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD).

### Example: Simple Harmonic Oscillator

Consider a simple harmonic oscillator with potential $V(x) = \frac{1}{2} k x^2$ and the corresponding dynamical system:
$$
\ddot{x} + \omega^2 x = 0,
$$
where $\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}$.

The Koopman operator $\mathcal{K}$ for this system acts on observables $g(x, \dot{x})$. The eigenfunctions are of the form:
$$
\phi_n(x, \dot{x}) = e^{i n \theta(x, \dot{x})},
$$
where $\theta(x, \dot{x})$ is the phase angle in the phase space, and the corresponding eigenvalues are $\lambda_n = e^{i n \omega t}$.

### Conclusion

Spectral analysis of dynamical systems using the Koopman and Perron-Frobenius operators provides deep insights into the system's long-term behavior and stability. By examining the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of these operators, one can understand the invariant measures, decay of correlations, and mixing properties. This framework is essential for applications ranging from ergodic theory to fluid dynamics and control theory.
