### Cesàro Average

The Cesàro average is a method used to find the average of a sequence by considering the means of its initial segments. This concept is named after the Italian mathematician Ernesto Cesàro and is particularly useful in the context of summability methods, where it is employed to assign values to divergent series or to study the convergence properties of sequences.

### Mathematical Definition

Given a sequence $\{a_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$, the Cesàro average of order $k$, denoted by $C_n^k$, is defined as the arithmetic mean of the first $n$ terms of the sequence of arithmetic means of order $k-1$. The most commonly used case is the Cesàro average of order 1, often referred to simply as the Cesàro average. It is defined as follows:

$$
C_n = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n a_k
$$

For higher orders, the definition is recursive. For order $k$:

$$
C_n^k = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{j=1}^n C_j^{k-1}
$$

where $C_n^0 = a_n$.

### Cesàro Summability

A sequence $\{a_n\}$ is said to be Cesàro summable if its Cesàro average converges to a limit as $n$ approaches infinity. Formally, $\{a_n\}$ is Cesàro summable to $L$ if:

$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} C_n = L
$$

### Properties

1. **Relation to Convergence**: If a sequence $\{a_n\}$ converges to a limit $L$, then its Cesàro average also converges to $L$. However, the converse is not necessarily true; a sequence can be Cesàro summable without being convergent.

2. **Stability under Linear Operations**: The Cesàro average is stable under addition and scalar multiplication. If $\{a_n\}$ and $\{b_n\}$ are two sequences and $\alpha, \beta$ are scalars, then:
   $$
   C_n(\alpha a_n + \beta b_n) = \alpha C_n(a_n) + \beta C_n(b_n)
   $$

3. **Regularization of Divergent Series**: The Cesàro average can assign finite values to some divergent series, providing a method to sum series that are not convergent in the traditional sense.

### Examples

1. **Convergent Sequence**: Consider the sequence $a_n = \frac{1}{n}$. The Cesàro average of this sequence is:
   $$
   C_n = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k}
   $$
   As $n$ approaches infinity, $C_n$ diverges logarithmically.

2. **Alternating Sequence**: For the sequence $a_n = (-1)^n$, the Cesàro average is:
   $$
   C_n = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n (-1)^k
   $$
   The partial sums of this sequence oscillate between 0 and -1. The Cesàro average, however, converges to 0 as $n$ approaches infinity.

### Applications

1. **Summability of Series**: The Cesàro average is used in summability theory to assign sums to series that are not summable in the traditional sense.
2. **Ergodic Theory**: In ergodic theory, the Cesàro average is used to study the time averages of dynamical systems.
3. **Fourier Series**: Cesàro summation is employed to investigate the convergence properties of Fourier series, particularly in cases where pointwise convergence fails.

### Conclusion

The Cesàro average provides a powerful tool for analyzing the convergence properties of sequences and series. By focusing on the means of initial segments, it offers insights into the behavior of sequences that may not be apparent through traditional convergence criteria. This method finds applications in various areas of mathematics, including summability theory, ergodic theory, and the study of Fourier series.
