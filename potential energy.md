Potential energy


**ASSISTANT**

*[[Potential Energy]]* is the energy stored in an object due to its position or configuration. It is a key concept in physics that helps in understanding the conservation of energy and the dynamics of systems. Unlike kinetic energy, which is associated with motion, potential energy is related to the position of an object within a force field.

### Types of Potential Energy

1. **Gravitational Potential Energy**:
   The gravitational potential energy \(U_g\) of an object of mass \(m\) at a height \(h\) above a reference level is given by:
   $$
   U_g = mgh
   $$
   where \(g\) is the acceleration due to gravity. This energy represents the work done against gravity to elevate the object to height \(h\).

2. **Elastic Potential Energy**:
   The elastic potential energy \(U_e\) stored in a spring that obeys Hooke's law is given by:
   $$
   U_e = \frac{1}{2} k x^2
   $$
   where \(k\) is the spring constant and \(x\) is the displacement from the equilibrium position. This energy represents the work done to compress or extend the spring.

3. **Electric Potential Energy**:
   The electric potential energy \(U_e\) of a charge \(q\) in an electric field \(E\) at a distance \(r\) from a source charge \(Q\) is given by:
   $$
   U_e = \frac{k_e Qq}{r}
   $$
   where \(k_e\) is Coulomb's constant. This energy represents the work done to bring the charge \(q\) from infinity to the point \(r\).

4. **Chemical Potential Energy**:
   Chemical potential energy is stored in the bonds between atoms in a molecule. It is released or absorbed during chemical reactions, such as combustion or photosynthesis.

### General Expression for Potential Energy

For a conservative force \(\mathbf{F}\), the potential energy function \(U(\mathbf{r})\) is defined such that the force is the negative gradient of the potential energy:
$$
\mathbf{F} = -\nabla U(\mathbf{r})
$$

### Conservation of Mechanical Energy

In a closed system where only conservative forces do work, the total mechanical energy (sum of kinetic and potential energies) is conserved:
$$
E_{\text{total}} = K + U = \text{constant}
$$

### Examples

1. **Projectile Motion**:
   For a projectile of mass \(m\) launched with an initial velocity \(v_0\) at an angle \(\theta\) from the horizontal, the gravitational potential energy at a height \(y\) is:
   $$
   U_g = mgy
   $$
   The total mechanical energy of the projectile at any point is the sum of its kinetic and potential energies.

2. **Pendulum**:
   For a simple pendulum of length \(L\) and mass \(m\), the gravitational potential energy at an angle \(\theta\) from the vertical is:
   $$
   U_g = mgL (1 - \cos \theta)
   $$
   As the pendulum swings, its energy oscillates between kinetic and potential forms, but the total mechanical energy remains constant.

### Potential Energy Diagrams

Potential energy diagrams plot the potential energy \(U\) as a function of position \(x\). They are useful for visualizing the stability and equilibrium points of a system:
- **Stable Equilibrium**: A point where \(U(x)\) has a local minimum. Small displacements result in a restoring force that brings the system back to equilibrium.
- **Unstable Equilibrium**: A point where \(U(x)\) has a local maximum. Small displacements result in forces that move the system away from equilibrium.
- **Neutral Equilibrium**: A point where \(U(x)\) is flat. Small displacements neither restore nor destabilize the system.

### Work Done by Conservative Forces

The work done by a conservative force as an object moves from point \(\mathbf{r}_1\) to point \(\mathbf{r}_2\) is equal to the negative change in potential energy:
$$
W_{\text{cons}} = -\Delta U = U(\mathbf{r}_1) - U(\mathbf{r}_2)
$$

### Conclusion

Potential energy is an essential concept in understanding the energy dynamics of systems and the conservation of mechanical energy. It is the energy associated with the position or configuration of an object within a force field.
