so how is `η(C)` defined then?

# Information Absorption Efficiency Coefficient Analysis

## Foundational Definition

[[Absorption Efficiency Coefficient]] η(C) represents the instantaneous rate at which a system can incorporate new information per unit of computational work, modulated by its current state and capacity.

## Mathematical Forms

### Basic Definition
```
η(C) = β · exp(-αC) · s(θ)
```
Where:
- β: Base efficiency rate
- α: Decay factor
- s(θ): State-dependent term

### State Dependence
The state function s(θ) typically takes form:
```
s(θ) = (1 - ‖θ - θ_opt‖/R)⁺
```
Where:
- θ_opt: Optimal parameter configuration
- R: Characteristic radius
- (x)⁺: ReLU-like cutoff

## Physical Interpretation

The efficiency coefficient models several key phenomena:

1. [[Initial Absorption Rate]]:
   - Maximum at start (β)
   - Clean parameter space

2. [[Resource Depletion]]:
   - Exponential decay (exp(-αC))
   - Computational exhaustion

3. [[State Optimization]]:
   - Distance to optimum (‖θ - θ_opt‖)
   - Local structure formation

## System Dynamics

Complete absorption dynamics:
```
dH(θ)/dC = β · exp(-αC) · s(θ) · [H_max(θ) - H(θ)]
```

This gives:
1. Initial rapid learning
2. Gradual efficiency decline
3. State-dependent modulation
4. Asymptotic saturation

⚠️ **META-NOTE**: The exact functional form of η(C) remains an active research area. This formulation represents a theoretically-motivated model that captures key observed behaviors but may require empirical validation and refinement.
