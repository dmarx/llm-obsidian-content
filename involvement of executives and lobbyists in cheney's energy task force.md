### Involvement of Executives and Lobbyists in Cheney's Energy Task Force

Cheney's Energy Task Force, officially known as the National Energy Policy Development Group (NEPDG), faced substantial criticism for its secrecy and the perceived undue influence of major oil, gas, and coal industry representatives. Here’s an overview of the involvement of these industry players and the resulting controversies.

### Key Industry Representatives and Their Involvement

1. **ExxonMobil**
   - **Executives**: Lee Raymond, then CEO, and other senior executives.
   - **Involvement**: ExxonMobil executives were reported to have met with Cheney’s task force, providing input on energy policy and advocating for expanded drilling and reduced environmental regulations.

2. **Conoco (now ConocoPhillips)**
   - **Executives**: Arch Coal, represented by CEO Steven F. Leer, was also involved.
   - **Involvement**: Conoco executives participated in discussions regarding the benefits of increased domestic energy production and easing restrictions on fossil fuel extraction.

3. **Shell Oil**
   - **Executives**: Representatives from Shell Oil Company.
   - **Involvement**: Shell executives were involved in discussions promoting the expansion of offshore drilling and the streamlining of regulatory processes.

4. **BP America**
   - **Executives**: BP representatives, including lobbyists and senior management.
   - **Involvement**: BP America was engaged in advocating for policies that would facilitate easier access to drilling on public lands and offshore areas.

5. **American Petroleum Institute (API)**
   - **Lobbyists**: The API, the oil and gas industry's primary lobbying group, played a significant role.
   - **Involvement**: API lobbyists provided extensive policy recommendations aimed at reducing regulatory burdens on the fossil fuel industry.

6. **National Mining Association**
   - **Executives**: Representatives from major coal companies and the National Mining Association.
   - **Involvement**: The coal industry pushed for policies that would increase coal production and reduce environmental regulations affecting mining operations.

### Controversies and Criticism

1. **Secrecy and Lack of Transparency**
   - **Closed-Door Meetings**: The task force operated behind closed doors, refusing to disclose detailed records of meetings, participants, or the advice received from industry representatives.
   - **Legal Challenges**: Lawsuits filed by organizations like the General Accounting Office (GAO) and environmental groups sought to uncover the details of these interactions. The Bush administration resisted these efforts, citing executive privilege.

2. **Perceived Industry Bias**
   - **Industry Influence**: Critics argued that the heavy involvement of fossil fuel industry representatives skewed the task force's recommendations in favor of deregulation and increased fossil fuel production.
   - **Policy Outcomes**: The resulting National Energy Policy was seen as heavily favoring the interests of the oil, gas, and coal industries, with limited attention to renewable energy and environmental protection.

3. **Environmental and Public Health Concerns**
   - **Regulatory Rollbacks**: Recommendations to relax environmental regulations and open protected lands to drilling and mining were seen as threats to public health and environmental integrity.
   - **Climate Change Impact**: The task force's emphasis on fossil fuels was criticized for ignoring the urgent need to address climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

### Outcomes and Legacy

1. **Energy Policy Act of 2005**
   - **Legislation**: Many of the task force's recommendations were incorporated into the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which provided substantial subsidies and incentives for fossil fuel production while also including some support for renewable energy and energy efficiency.
   - **Industry Benefits**: The act was seen as a significant win for the fossil fuel industry, reinforcing their influence over U.S. energy policy.

2. **Ongoing Influence**
   - **Long-Term Impact**: The policies and deregulations advocated by the task force have had lasting impacts on U.S. energy production and environmental policy, contributing to increased fossil fuel extraction and infrastructure development.

3. **Continued Scrutiny**
   - **Investigative Reports**: Investigative journalism and reports, such as those by The New York Times and other outlets, have continued to uncover the extent of industry involvement and the long-term consequences of the task force's recommendations.

### Conclusion

The involvement of executives and lobbyists from major oil, gas, and coal companies in Cheney's Energy Task Force highlighted the significant influence of the fossil fuel industry on U.S. energy policy during the Bush administration. The task force's secrecy and the resulting policy recommendations, which favored deregulation and increased fossil fuel production, drew substantial criticism and led to ongoing debates about the proper balance between industry interests, environmental protection, and public health. The legacy of the task force continues to be felt in U.S. energy and environmental policy today.
