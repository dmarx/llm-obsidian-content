# Detailed Balance and Bayesian Inference: A Natural Symmetry

## Core Connection

The relationship between [[detailed balance]] and [[Bayesian inference]] emerges through their shared mathematical structure of reciprocal relationships. Both frameworks deal with transitions between states of knowledge or physical configurations that exhibit fundamental symmetries.

## Mathematical Formalization

### Detailed Balance
For physical systems, detailed balance states:

P(x → y)π(x) = P(y → x)π(y)

where:
- π(x) represents equilibrium probability
- P(x → y) represents transition probability

### Bayesian Update
The [[Bayesian update]] formula:

P(θ|D) = P(D|θ)P(θ)/P(D)

where:
- P(θ|D) is the posterior probability
- P(D|θ) is the likelihood
- P(θ) is the prior
- P(D) is the evidence

## The Symmetry Connection

The [[detailed balance condition]] can be rewritten in Bayesian form:

P(y|x)P(x) = P(x|y)P(y)

This reveals detailed balance as a kind of [[Bayesian reciprocity]]. Define the [[Bayes operator]] B:

B(x,y) = P(y|x)/P(x|y)

Then detailed balance requires:
B(x,y) = P(y)/P(x)

## Markov Chain Monte Carlo Connection

The [[Metropolis-Hastings algorithm]] explicitly uses this connection:

A(x → y) = min(1, [P(y)P(x|y)]/[P(x)P(y|x)])

where A is the acceptance probability. This ensures:
1. [[Detailed balance]] is maintained
2. The chain converges to the desired [[posterior distribution]]

## Information Theoretic Perspective

Define the [[information flow]] I between states:

I(x → y) = log(P(y|x)/P(x|y))

Detailed balance requires:
I(x → y) = log(P(y)/P(x))

This connects to the [[Kullback-Leibler divergence]]:

D_KL(P||Q) = ∫ P(x)log(P(x)/Q(x))dx

## Equilibrium as Maximum Entropy

Both frameworks converge to distributions that maximize [[entropy]] subject to constraints:

S = -∫ P(x)log(P(x))dx

subject to:
- Normalization: ∫ P(x)dx = 1
- Observable constraints: ∫ f_i(x)P(x)dx = ⟨f_i⟩

## Learning and Thermodynamics

This connection suggests interpreting [[Bayesian learning]] as a thermodynamic process:

1. Prior = initial state
2. Evidence = energy function
3. Posterior = equilibrium distribution
4. Learning = approach to equilibrium

The [[free energy principle]] formalizes this:

F = ⟨E⟩ - TS

where:
- E is surprise (-log likelihood)
- T is temperature (learning rate)
- S is entropy

## Philosophical Implications

This relationship suggests:

1. [[Learning as equilibration]] - knowledge acquisition follows same principles as physical equilibration
2. [[Epistemic detailed balance]] - beliefs should satisfy reciprocal relationships
3. [[Information conservation]] - proper updating preserves relevant information

These principles provide a foundation for [[rational learning]] based on physical law.
