## Lyapunov Stability

### Introduction

Lyapunov stability is a concept used in the study of dynamical systems to analyze the stability of equilibrium points. Named after the Russian mathematician Aleksandr Lyapunov, this theory provides a method for determining whether small perturbations or deviations from an equilibrium state will decay over time (stability) or grow, leading the system away from equilibrium (instability).

### Definitions

1. **Equilibrium Point**: An equilibrium point \( x^* \) of a dynamical system is a point where the system remains at rest if initially at rest, i.e., \( f(x^*) = 0 \) for the system \( \dot{x} = f(x) \).

2. **Lyapunov Stability**: An equilibrium point \( x^* \) is Lyapunov stable if, for any small perturbation \(\epsilon > 0\), there exists a \(\delta > 0\) such that if the initial state \( x(0) \) satisfies \( \|x(0) - x^* \| < \delta \), then \( \|x(t) - x^* \| < \epsilon \) for all \( t \ge 0 \).

3. **Asymptotic Stability**: An equilibrium point \( x^* \) is asymptotically stable if it is Lyapunov stable and, additionally, \( \|x(t) - x^* \| \to 0 \) as \( t \to \infty \).

4. **Exponential Stability**: An equilibrium point \( x^* \) is exponentially stable if there exist positive constants \( C \) and \(\alpha\) such that \( \|x(t) - x^* \| \le C e^{-\alpha t} \|x(0) - x^* \| \) for all \( t \ge 0 \).

### Lyapunov's Direct Method

Lyapunov's direct method involves constructing a Lyapunov function, which is an analogy to the concept of potential energy in physical systems.

1. **Lyapunov Function**: A scalar function \( V(x) \) that is continuously differentiable, positive definite (\( V(x) > 0 \) for all \( x \neq x^* \) and \( V(x^*) = 0 \)), and has a negative definite derivative along the trajectories of the system.

#### Steps to Use Lyapunov's Direct Method

1. **Choose a Candidate Lyapunov Function**: Select \( V(x) \) such that \( V(x) \) is positive definite and \( V(x^*) = 0 \).
2. **Compute the Derivative of \( V(x) \) Along the System Trajectories**: Find \( \dot{V}(x) = \frac{dV}{dt} = \nabla V \cdot \dot{x} \).
3. **Analyze the Sign of \( \dot{V}(x) \)**:
   - If \( \dot{V}(x) \le 0 \) (negative semi-definite), \( x^* \) is Lyapunov stable.
   - If \( \dot{V}(x) < 0 \) (negative definite), \( x^* \) is asymptotically stable.
   - If \( \dot{V}(x) \le -cV(x) \) for some \( c > 0 \), \( x^* \) is exponentially stable.

### Example

Consider the simple linear system:

$$
\dot{x} = -kx
$$

where \( k > 0 \). The equilibrium point is \( x^* = 0 \).

1. **Candidate Lyapunov Function**:
   \[
   V(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^2
   \]

2. **Compute the Derivative**:
   \[
   \dot{V}(x) = \frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{1}{2}x^2\right) = x \dot{x} = x(-kx) = -kx^2
   \]

3. **Analyze the Sign**:
   \[
   \dot{V}(x) = -kx^2
   \]
   Since \( k > 0 \), \( \dot{V}(x) \) is negative definite.

Thus, \( x^* = 0 \) is asymptotically stable. Additionally, since \( \dot{V}(x) \le -kV(x) \), the equilibrium is also exponentially stable.

### Lyapunov's Indirect Method

Lyapunov's indirect method involves linearizing the nonlinear system around the equilibrium point and analyzing the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix of the system.

1. **Linearization**: Consider a nonlinear system \( \dot{x} = f(x) \) with an equilibrium point at \( x^* \). The linearized system around \( x^* \) is given by:
   \[
   \dot{y} = A y
   \]
   where \( y = x - x^* \) and \( A = \left.\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\right|_{x=x^*} \) is the Jacobian matrix evaluated at the equilibrium point.

2. **Eigenvalue Analysis**:
   - If all eigenvalues of \( A \) have negative real parts, \( x^* \) is asymptotically stable.
   - If at least one eigenvalue has a positive real part, \( x^* \) is unstable.
   - If eigenvalues have non-positive real parts and at least one eigenvalue has zero real part, further analysis is required.

### Conclusion

Lyapunov stability provides a powerful framework for analyzing the stability of dynamical systems. By constructing appropriate Lyapunov functions and analyzing the system's behavior near equilibrium points, one can determine the stability characteristics of the system.
