Gartner-Ellis Theorem

## Gartner-Ellis Theorem

### Overview

The Gartner-Ellis Theorem is a key result in large deviations theory, extending the classical Cramér’s theorem to a broader range of situations, particularly those involving sequences of non-independent and non-identically distributed random variables. The theorem provides conditions under which a sequence of random variables satisfies a [[large deviations principle]] (LDP) by examining the limiting behavior of their scaled cumulant generating functions.

### Statement of the Theorem

Consider a sequence of random variables $\{X_n\}_{n \geq 1}$, and let $L_n(\lambda)$ denote the scaled cumulant generating function:

$$
L_n(\lambda) = \frac{1}{n} \log \mathbb{E}\left[ e^{n \lambda X_n} \right].
$$

#### Assumptions

1. **Existence of the Limiting Function**: Assume that the limit

    $$
    \Lambda(\lambda) = \lim_{n \to \infty} L_n(\lambda)
    $$

    exists for all $\lambda$ in some interval $\Lambda$, which can be $\mathbb{R}$ or a subset of $\mathbb{R}$.

2. **Differentiability**: Assume that $\Lambda(\lambda)$ is differentiable on the interior of the interval $\Lambda$.

#### Rate Function

The rate function $I(x)$ is given by the Legendre-Fenchel transform of $\Lambda(\lambda)$:

$$
I(x) = \sup_{\lambda \in \Lambda} \left( \lambda x - \Lambda(\lambda) \right).
$$

### Result

Under the above assumptions, the sequence $\{X_n\}_{n \geq 1}$ satisfies a [[large deviations principle]] with the rate function $I(x)$, meaning that for any measurable set $A$,

$$
-\inf_{x \in A^\circ} I(x) \leq \liminf_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n} \log \Pr(X_n \in A) \leq \limsup_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n} \log \Pr(X_n \in A) \leq -\inf_{x \in \overline{A}} I(x),
$$

where $A^\circ$ is the interior of $A$ and $\overline{A}$ is the closure of $A$.

### Intuition and Interpretation

The Gartner-Ellis theorem generalizes the classical Cramér’s theorem by removing the requirement that the random variables be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). Instead, it focuses on the behavior of their cumulant generating functions. The theorem essentially states that if the scaled cumulant generating function converges to a well-behaved limit, then the sequence of random variables exhibits a [[large deviations principle]] with a rate function determined by the Legendre-Fenchel transform of this limit.

### Applications

#### Statistical Physics

In statistical mechanics, the Gartner-Ellis theorem is useful for studying fluctuations in thermodynamic quantities. For example, in large systems where quantities like energy, magnetization, or particle number exhibit fluctuations, the theorem helps in deriving the rate functions that describe the probabilities of large deviations from equilibrium values.

#### Queueing Theory

In the study of queueing systems, the theorem can be applied to understand the fluctuations in the number of customers or waiting times, providing insights into the rare events of extreme congestion or long delays.

#### Finance and Risk Management

The Gartner-Ellis theorem can be used to analyze the risk of large losses or gains in financial portfolios by studying the large deviations of returns, providing a theoretical foundation for risk assessment and management.

### Examples

#### Example 1: Sum of Random Variables

Consider a sequence of random variables $\{X_i\}$, and let $S_n = \sum_{i=1}^n X_i$. Suppose the scaled cumulant generating function of $X_i$ converges to $\Lambda(\lambda)$ as $n \to \infty$. Then, the average $\overline{X}_n = \frac{1}{n} S_n$ satisfies an LDP with the rate function:

$$
I(x) = \sup_{\lambda} \left( \lambda x - \Lambda(\lambda) \right).
$$

#### Example 2: Current Fluctuations in Diffusive Systems

In systems described by fluctuating hydrodynamics, such as particle diffusion, the cumulant generating function of the particle current $J$ over time $t$ might converge to a limit $\Lambda(\lambda)$. Applying the Gartner-Ellis theorem, the probability of observing a large deviation in the particle current can be written as:

$$
\Pr(J) \sim \exp(-t I(J)),
$$

where $I(J)$ is the rate function obtained from the Legendre-Fenchel transform of $\Lambda(\lambda)$.
