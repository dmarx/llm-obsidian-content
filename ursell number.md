### Ursell Number

The **Ursell number** is a dimensionless parameter used in the study of surface [[gravity waves]], particularly in shallow water contexts. It quantifies the relative importance of nonlinear effects compared to dispersive effects in the propagation of waves. The Ursell number is named after the British mathematician Fritz Ursell, who introduced it in the context of long-wave theory.

### Definition

The Ursell number \( U \) is defined as:

$$
U = \frac{H \lambda^2}{h^3}
$$

where:
- \( H \) is the wave height,
- \( \lambda \) is the wavelength,
- \( h \) is the water depth.

### Physical Interpretation

1. **Nonlinearity vs. Dispersion**:
   - **Nonlinear Effects**: As waves become taller (larger \( H \)) or longer (larger \( \lambda \)), nonlinear effects, such as [[wave steepening]], become more significant. These effects can lead to phenomena like [[wave breaking]] or the formation of solitary waves.
   - **Dispersive Effects**: Dispersion refers to the phenomenon where different wavelengths travel at different speeds, leading to the spreading of a wave packet. In deep water, dispersion tends to dominate, but in shallow water, nonlinear effects can become more important.

2. **Wave Regimes**:
   - **Small Ursell Number (\( U \ll 1 \))**: When the Ursell number is small, dispersive effects dominate. This regime corresponds to deep water or intermediate water depths, where the linear wave theory (Airy wave theory) is typically sufficient to describe wave behavior.
   - **Large Ursell Number (\( U \gg 1 \))**: When the Ursell number is large, nonlinear effects dominate. This regime corresponds to shallow water, where waves become significantly distorted, leading to non-sinusoidal wave shapes. The linear wave theory is no longer adequate, and nonlinear theories, such as the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation or Boussinesq equations, are needed to accurately describe wave behavior.

### Applications of the Ursell Number

1. **Shallow Water Wave Theory**:
   - The Ursell number is particularly relevant in shallow water, where the water depth \( h \) is small relative to the wavelength \( \lambda \). In these conditions, waves are more likely to exhibit nonlinear characteristics such as asymmetry between the wave crest and trough, [[wave steepening]], and solitary wave formation.
   - For large Ursell numbers, shallow water wave theories, such as the Boussinesq equations or the Korteweg-de Vries equation, are used to model wave dynamics. These theories account for the significant nonlinear effects that are not captured by linear wave theory.

2. **Coastal Engineering**:
   - In coastal engineering, the Ursell number helps engineers decide which wave theory to apply when modeling wave behavior near the shore. It informs decisions about the design of coastal structures, such as breakwaters, seawalls, and harbors, ensuring that they can withstand the wave forces predicted by appropriate models.
   - High Ursell numbers, indicative of significant nonlinear effects, suggest that [[wave breaking]], overtopping, and energy dissipation processes are critical considerations in design.

3. **Wave Breaking and Run-Up**:
   - The Ursell number is also used to predict [[wave breaking]] and run-up on beaches. Large Ursell numbers indicate that waves are more likely to steepen and break as they approach the shore, leading to higher run-up and potential coastal erosion.
   - Understanding the role of the Ursell number in wave dynamics is crucial for predicting and mitigating the impacts of storm surges, [[tsunamis]], and other extreme wave events on coastal areas.

4. **Oceanography and Tsunami Modeling**:
   - In [[oceanography]], the Ursell number is important for modeling [[tsunamis]], which are characterized by long wavelengths and significant nonlinearity, especially in shallow water near coastlines. High Ursell numbers in tsunami modeling indicate the need for nonlinear wave models to accurately predict wave propagation, inundation, and impact on coastal communities.

### Practical Considerations

1. **Typical Values**:
   - In practice, the Ursell number can range widely depending on the specific wave conditions and water depth. For example:
     - In deep water, where \( h \) is large compared to \( \lambda \), the Ursell number is typically small, indicating that linear wave theory is adequate.
     - In shallow water, particularly in coastal zones or estuaries, the Ursell number can become large, necessitating the use of nonlinear wave models.

2. **Transition Regime**:
   - There is no sharp boundary between the regimes where linear and nonlinear theories apply, but the Ursell number helps identify when the transition occurs. For \( U \) values around 1 to 10, the wave behavior may require a combination of linear and nonlinear models, depending on the specific scenario.

### Conclusion

The **Ursell number** is a critical dimensionless parameter in wave dynamics, providing insight into the relative importance of nonlinear and dispersive effects in wave propagation, especially in shallow water environments. It guides the selection of appropriate wave models, from linear theories for small Ursell numbers to nonlinear theories for large Ursell numbers, and is essential in applications ranging from coastal engineering to tsunami modeling. Understanding and applying the Ursell number allows for more accurate predictions of wave behavior, aiding in the design of coastal defenses, the management of coastal erosion, and the protection of communities from extreme wave events.
