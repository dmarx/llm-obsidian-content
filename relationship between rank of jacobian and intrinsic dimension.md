relationship between rank of jacobian and intrinsic dimension


**ASSISTANT**

In algebraic geometry, the relationship between the rank of the Jacobian matrix of a set of defining equations and the intrinsic dimension of the variety defined by these equations is a crucial aspect of determining the local geometric properties of the variety, particularly its dimension and whether it has any singularities.

### The Jacobian Matrix

For a set of polynomial functions $f_1, f_2, \ldots, f_m$ that define an affine variety $V$ in $n$-dimensional space $\mathbb{A}^n(k)$ over a field $k$, the Jacobian matrix is defined as follows:

$$
J = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_1} & \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_2} & \cdots & \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_n} \\
\frac{\partial f_2}{\partial x_1} & \frac{\partial f_2}{\partial x_2} & \cdots & \frac{\partial f_2}{\partial x_n} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
\frac{\partial f_m}{\partial x_1} & \frac{\partial f_m}{\partial x_2} & \cdots & \frac{\partial f_m}{\partial x_n}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

This matrix is evaluated at each point in the variety. The rank of this matrix at a point gives important information about the variety at that point.

### Dimension of Varieties

The intrinsic dimension of an affine variety $V$ can typically be estimated by the formula:

$$
\text{dim}(V) = n - \text{rank}(J)
$$

where $n$ is the number of variables (the ambient space's dimension), and $\text{rank}(J)$ is the rank of the Jacobian matrix of the defining polynomials at a general point of the variety. This relationship arises from the fact that the dimension of the variety at a point is essentially the maximal number of directions in which you can move within the variety from that point, which is dependent on the degrees of freedom left after imposing the constraints defined by the polynomials.

### Singularities and Smooth Points

- **Smooth Points**: A point on $V$ is non-singular (or smooth) if the rank of the Jacobian matrix at that point is maximal, specifically equal to $n - \text{dim}(V)$. This implies that locally around that point, the variety behaves like a smooth manifold of dimension equal to $\text{dim}(V)$.
- **Singular Points**: If the rank of the Jacobian matrix at a point is less than $n - \text{dim}(V)$, that point is a singular point of the variety. At singular points, the local geometry does not resemble a smooth manifold, possibly due to intersections, cusps, or other types of irregular behavior.

### Examples

1. **The Circle**: Consider the circle defined by $x^2 + y^2 - 1 = 0$ in $\mathbb{A}^2$. Here, $n = 2$ and $m = 1$. The Jacobian matrix is a $1 \times 2$ matrix, $J = [2x, 2y]$. At any non-zero point on the circle, the rank of $J$ is 1. Thus, the intrinsic dimension is $2 - 1 = 1$, which matches our expectation of a circle being a 1-dimensional object.

2. **A Cusp**: For the curve $y^2 - x^3 = 0$ in $\mathbb{A}^2$, the Jacobian matrix is $[-3x^2, 2y]$. At the origin $(0, 0)$, the Jacobian matrix has rank 0, less than $2 - 1$, indicating a singularity at the origin.

The connection between the Jacobian's rank and the variety's intrinsic dimension is fundamental in both local analysis of the variety's structure and global geometric understanding. This relationship is also pivotal in more advanced settings, such as calculating multiplicities and studying deformations of varieties.
