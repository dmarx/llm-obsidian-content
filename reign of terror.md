**ASSISTANT**

The [[Reign of Terror]] was a period of radical political and social upheaval during the [[French Revolution]]. It spanned from September 5, 1793, to July 28, 1794, and was marked by mass executions, intense political repression, and the dominance of the radical Jacobin faction. The following sections provide a detailed exploration of this period.

## Historical Context

The [[Reign of Terror]] occurred in the aftermath of the French Revolution, which began in 1789 with the aim of overthrowing the monarchy and establishing a republic. By 1793, the revolution had entered a more radical phase due to several factors:

1. **Internal Conflicts**: The [[Girondins]] and [[Jacobins]] were the primary political factions vying for control. The Jacobins, led by figures like [[Maximilien Robespierre]] and [[Georges Danton]], sought to centralize power and implement sweeping reforms.
2. **External Threats**: France was at war with various European coalitions intent on restoring the monarchy. This external pressure heightened the sense of urgency and paranoia within the revolutionary government.
3. **Economic Hardship**: Severe food shortages and economic instability led to widespread discontent among the populace.

## Key Features

### The Committee of Public Safety

The [[Committee of Public Safety]] was established in April 1793 to protect the newly established republic from internal and external enemies. Dominated by the Jacobins, it wielded extraordinary powers, including the authority to arrest, try, and execute suspected enemies of the revolution.

### Law of Suspects

Enacted on September 17, 1793, the [[Law of Suspects]] broadened the scope of those who could be arrested and tried for counter-revolutionary activities. This law was a critical tool in the widespread political repression characteristic of the [[Reign of Terror]].

### Revolutionary Tribunals

The establishment of [[Revolutionary Tribunals]] expedited the process of trying and executing suspects. These courts often lacked proper legal procedures, and the accused had limited rights of defense.

## Execution and Repression

The most infamous aspect of the [[Reign of Terror]] was the mass execution of perceived enemies of the revolution. The primary instrument of execution was the guillotine. Notable victims included:

- **[[Louis XVI]]**: The former king was executed on January 21, 1793, an event that set a precedent for the elimination of perceived threats.
- **[[Marie Antoinette]]**: The queen was executed on October 16, 1793.
- **[[Georges Danton]]**: Initially a prominent revolutionary leader, Danton fell out of favor with the more radical Jacobins and was executed on April 5, 1794.

## End of the Reign of Terror

The [[Reign of Terror]] ended with the fall of Robespierre on July 27, 1794 (9 Thermidor, Year II in the revolutionary calendar). Robespierre's arrest and subsequent execution marked the decline of radical Jacobin power and a shift towards more moderate revolutionary policies.

## Legacy

The [[Reign of Terror]] left a lasting impact on French and global history. It exemplified the dangers of radicalism and the extent to which political movements might go to consolidate power. The period remains a subject of intense historical debate, particularly concerning the justification and necessity of the extreme measures taken.
