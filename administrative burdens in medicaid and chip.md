### Administrative Burdens in Medicaid and CHIP

Research by the Kaiser Family Foundation indicates that administrative burdens in Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) result in eligible individuals being unenrolled. Frequent recertifications and extensive documentation requirements are major contributing factors.

### Key Issues

1. **Frequent Recertifications:**
   - **Short Recertification Periods:** Many states require beneficiaries to recertify their eligibility for Medicaid and CHIP every few months. This frequent recertification process can be burdensome and lead to interruptions in coverage if deadlines are missed.
   - **Re-verification Requirements:** Each recertification period often requires re-verification of income, residency, and other eligibility factors, adding to the administrative load on both applicants and program administrators.

2. **Extensive Documentation Requirements:**
   - **Proof of Eligibility:** Applicants and current beneficiaries must provide extensive documentation to prove eligibility, including income statements, identification documents, and proof of residency. Gathering these documents can be challenging, particularly for individuals with unstable living situations or limited access to resources.
   - **Verification Processes:** The verification process can be lengthy and cumbersome, requiring repeated submissions and back-and-forth communication with program administrators.

3. **Complex Application Procedures:**
   - **Lengthy Forms:** Medicaid and CHIP applications can be long and complicated, requiring detailed information that can be difficult for applicants to provide.
   - **In-Person Interviews:** Some states require in-person interviews as part of the application or recertification process, which can be a barrier for individuals with limited transportation, work conflicts, or caregiving responsibilities.

### Empirical Evidence

1. **Enrollment and Participation Rates:**
   - **Medicaid and CHIP Disenrollment:** The Kaiser Family Foundation’s research shows that frequent recertifications and administrative burdens contribute to disenrollment among eligible individuals. These barriers result in eligible individuals losing their coverage, often without their knowledge.
   - **Churn:** Churn, or the cycling of individuals on and off Medicaid and CHIP, is exacerbated by administrative hurdles. This churn can lead to gaps in coverage, higher administrative costs, and disruptions in care continuity.

2. **Impact on Vulnerable Populations:**
   - **Low-Income and Homeless Individuals:** The complexity of the application and recertification process disproportionately affects low-income and homeless individuals, who may struggle to gather the necessary documentation or meet in-person requirements.
   - **Children and Families:** Children and families are particularly impacted by these administrative burdens. When parents lose coverage due to administrative issues, their children are often affected as well, leading to higher rates of uninsured children.

### Policy Recommendations

1. **Simplifying Application and Recertification Processes:**
   - **Streamlined Applications:** Simplifying the application process by reducing the number of required documents and consolidating forms can make it easier for individuals to apply for benefits. Utilizing pre-filled forms based on existing data can also reduce the burden on applicants.
   - **Extend Recertification Intervals:** Extending recertification intervals to 12 months or longer can reduce the frequency of reapplication and provide more stability for beneficiaries. Simplifying the recertification process to require minimal documentation and verification can also help maintain enrollment.

2. **Improving Access and Support:**
   - **Multichannel Application Options:** Offering multiple ways to apply, including online, by phone, by mail, and in person, can accommodate the diverse needs and circumstances of applicants. Ensuring that online applications are mobile-friendly can help bridge the digital divide.
   - **Application Assistance:** Providing assistance through community organizations, social workers, and helplines can help applicants navigate the process. Training staff to offer clear guidance and support can improve the applicant experience and reduce errors.

3. **Reducing Administrative Burden:**
   - **Integrated Data Systems:** Developing integrated data systems that allow different agencies to share information can reduce the need for applicants to repeatedly provide the same documentation. Streamlining inter-agency communication and data sharing can improve efficiency and reduce the burden on applicants.
   - **Simplified Verification Processes:** Simplifying verification processes by using data matching and electronic verification (e.g., using tax records or payroll systems) can reduce the need for extensive documentation.

4. **Policy Changes:**
   - **Continuous Eligibility:** Implementing continuous eligibility policies, particularly for children, can ensure that once individuals are enrolled, they remain covered for a set period (e.g., 12 months), regardless of changes in income or circumstances.
   - **Presumptive Eligibility:** Allowing for presumptive eligibility, where individuals are temporarily enrolled based on preliminary information while their full application is processed, can prevent gaps in coverage.

### Conclusion

Administrative burdens in Medicaid and CHIP, including frequent recertifications and extensive documentation requirements, lead to the disenrollment of eligible individuals, resulting in coverage gaps and disruptions in care. Simplifying application and recertification processes, improving access and support, reducing administrative burdens, and implementing policy changes like continuous eligibility and presumptive eligibility can help ensure that more individuals receive and maintain the coverage they need. These measures can improve health outcomes, reduce healthcare costs, and enhance the overall effectiveness of Medicaid and CHIP programs.
