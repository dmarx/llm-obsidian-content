### Historical Examples of Redefining Thresholds and Metrics for Political Manipulation

#### 1. United States: Adjustments to the Poverty Line

**Context**: In the United States, the official poverty measure was developed in the 1960s by Mollie Orshansky, an economist at the Social Security Administration. It was based on the cost of a minimum food diet multiplied by three, under the assumption that food expenses accounted for one-third of a family's budget.

**Manipulation**:
- **Revisions and Adjustments**: Over the years, there have been political debates over whether to adjust the poverty line for inflation and how to account for non-cash benefits like food stamps and tax credits. For instance, changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) calculation methods can influence the poverty rate.
- **Selective Inclusion**: Decisions on whether to include non-cash benefits and tax credits in income calculations have significant political implications. Including these benefits can artificially lower the poverty rate, making it appear that fewer people are living in poverty.

**Impact**:
- Politicians may push for the inclusion or exclusion of certain benefits in income calculations to present a more favorable economic situation, particularly around election times or budget approvals.

#### 2. United Kingdom: Changes to Child Poverty Definitions

**Context**: In the early 2000s, the UK government under Prime Minister Tony Blair set ambitious targets to reduce child poverty, using a relative poverty measure (60% of median income).

**Manipulation**:
- **Redefinition**: Subsequent governments, particularly under Conservative leadership, have altered the definitions and thresholds for measuring child poverty. For example, in 2016, the UK government shifted focus from relative income measures to metrics like educational attainment and worklessness, effectively changing how poverty was assessed and reported.

**Impact**:
- By redefining the metrics, the government could claim progress on reducing child poverty without addressing the underlying income disparities. This shift in focus can downplay the economic aspects of poverty and emphasize factors that may be more favorable or easier to control politically.

#### 3. Soviet Union: Reporting Economic Data

**Context**: The Soviet Union was known for its manipulation of economic and social data to portray a more successful and equitable society than existed in reality.

**Manipulation**:
- **Inflated Metrics**: The Soviet government often reported inflated agricultural and industrial production figures. These inflated numbers were used to demonstrate the success of communist policies.
- **Changing Metrics**: The definitions of key metrics, such as productivity and living standards, were often altered to show continuous improvement. For instance, the definition of poverty and living standards could be manipulated to exclude certain groups or regions.

**Impact**:
- These manipulations were used to maintain internal political stability and present a positive image to the outside world. The lack of accurate data hindered the ability to address real economic and social issues effectively.

#### 4. India: Poverty Line Adjustments

**Context**: India has periodically adjusted its poverty line, which has significant implications for policy and international perceptions of economic development.

**Manipulation**:
- **Revision of Poverty Lines**: The government has revised the poverty line several times, often lowering it to show a decrease in poverty rates. For example, the Tendulkar Committee in 2009 recommended a new poverty line that resulted in lower poverty rates compared to previous estimates.
- **Selective Measurement**: Different committees and commissions have used varying methodologies and criteria for defining the poverty line, influenced by political pressures to demonstrate economic progress.

**Impact**:
- These adjustments can significantly alter the reported number of people living in poverty, affecting domestic policy decisions and international aid and investment. Lowering the poverty threshold can make it appear that more people have moved out of poverty, even if their real living conditions have not improved.

#### 5. European Union: Adjusting Unemployment Metrics

**Context**: In the European Union, various countries have adjusted the definitions and reporting methods for unemployment to meet political objectives.

**Manipulation**:
- **Reclassification of Workers**: Some countries have reclassified certain groups of unemployed individuals as inactive or under different categories that do not count towards the official unemployment statistics.
- **Methodological Changes**: Adjustments in the way unemployment surveys are conducted or the criteria for being considered unemployed can lead to lower reported unemployment rates.

**Impact**:
- These changes can be used to present a more favorable economic situation, especially during economic crises or periods of political instability. It can also affect eligibility for certain types of EU funding and support programs.

#### Conclusion

The political manipulation of poverty metrics and thresholds has been a recurring issue in many countries, as governments seek to present a more favorable economic and social landscape. These manipulations can undermine the credibility of official statistics, lead to misguided policies, and obscure the real challenges faced by disadvantaged populations. Understanding these historical examples helps to recognize the importance of transparency, consistency, and independent oversight in the measurement and reporting of poverty and other socio-economic indicators.
