### Elastomers

Elastomers are a type of polymer with viscoelastic properties, characterized by their ability to undergo significant deformation and return to their original shape when the stress is removed. This elasticity is due to the polymer chains' flexibility and the presence of crosslinks that provide a three-dimensional network structure.

### Key Properties of Elastomers

1. **Elasticity**: Elastomers can stretch to several times their original length and return to their original shape when the force is released.
2. **Viscoelasticity**: They exhibit both viscous and elastic behavior, meaning they can flow like a viscous liquid under long-term stress but behave elastically under short-term stress.
3. **Low Glass Transition Temperature**: Elastomers have a glass transition temperature (\(T_g\)) below room temperature, allowing them to remain flexible at low temperatures.

### Structure of Elastomers

Elastomers are typically composed of long, coiled polymer chains with some degree of crosslinking:

1. **Polymer Chains**: The chains are usually amorphous and have a high degree of flexibility.
2. **Crosslinks**: These are covalent bonds that connect different polymer chains, creating a network structure. The density and type of crosslinks affect the elastomer's properties.

### Types of Elastomers

#### Natural Rubber

- **Source**: Derived from the latex of the rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis).
- **Structure**: Consists mainly of cis-1,4-polyisoprene.
- **Properties**: High elasticity, good tensile strength, and abrasion resistance. However, it is sensitive to heat, light, and ozone.

#### Synthetic Elastomers

1. **Styrene-Butadiene Rubber (SBR)**
   - **Composition**: Copolymer of styrene and butadiene.
   - **Properties**: Good abrasion resistance, aging stability, and heat resistance. Commonly used in tires, footwear, and conveyor belts.
2. **Polybutadiene (BR)**
   - **Properties**: High resilience and excellent wear resistance. Used in tire manufacturing and high-impact polystyrene (HIPS) production.
3. **Nitrile Rubber (NBR)**
   - **Composition**: Copolymer of acrylonitrile and butadiene.
   - **Properties**: Excellent oil and fuel resistance. Used in hoses, seals, and gaskets.
4. **Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer (EPDM)**
   - **Composition**: Copolymer of ethylene, propylene, and a diene monomer.
   - **Properties**: Outstanding weather, ozone, and heat resistance. Used in automotive weather stripping, roofing membranes, and hoses.
5. **Silicone Rubber**
   - **Composition**: Polysiloxanes with silicon-oxygen backbone.
   - **Properties**: Excellent thermal stability, flexibility at low temperatures, and biocompatibility. Used in medical devices, cookware, and seals.
6. **Butyl Rubber (IIR)**
   - **Composition**: Copolymer of isobutylene with a small amount of isoprene.
   - **Properties**: Excellent air impermeability and chemical resistance. Used in inner tubes and sealing applications.

### Synthesis of Elastomers

#### Addition Polymerization

1. **Free Radical Polymerization**: Used for SBR, NBR, and polybutadiene.
   - **Initiator**: Free radicals generated from compounds like benzoyl peroxide.
   - **Mechanism**: The initiator starts the polymerization by creating reactive radicals that add to monomers, forming long chains.

2. **Coordination Polymerization**: Used for high-cis polybutadiene.
   - **Catalyst**: Ziegler-Natta or metallocene catalysts.
   - **Mechanism**: The catalyst coordinates with the monomer, facilitating polymerization and controlling the polymer structure.

#### Condensation Polymerization

1. **Silicone Rubber**: Formed by condensation of silanes with siloxane bonds.
   - **Monomers**: Silanes such as dimethyldichlorosilane.
   - **Reaction**: Hydrolysis and condensation reactions form long polysiloxane chains.

### Applications of Elastomers

1. **Automotive Industry**
   - **Tires**: SBR and polybutadiene are widely used in tire manufacturing.
   - **Seals and Gaskets**: EPDM, NBR, and silicone rubber are used for their sealing properties and resistance to various environmental factors.

2. **Construction**
   - **Roofing Membranes**: EPDM is used for its weather resistance and durability.
   - **Sealants**: Butyl rubber and silicone rubber are used in construction sealants.

3. **Consumer Goods**
   - **Footwear**: Elastomers like SBR are used in soles for their durability and cushioning properties.
   - **Household Items**: Silicone rubber is used in kitchenware and household seals due to its thermal stability and flexibility.

4. **Medical Devices**
   - **Catheters and Tubing**: Silicone rubber is favored for its biocompatibility and flexibility.
   - **Seals and Gaskets**: Used in medical equipment for reliable sealing properties.

### Properties and Performance

1. **Mechanical Properties**: Tensile strength, elongation at break, hardness, and abrasion resistance.
2. **Thermal Properties**: Thermal stability, glass transition temperature, and thermal conductivity.
3. **Chemical Resistance**: Resistance to oils, solvents, acids, and alkalis.
4. **Environmental Resistance**: Resistance to ozone, UV radiation, and weathering.

### Example: Synthesis and Application of EPDM

**Synthesis**: EPDM is synthesized by coordination polymerization using a Ziegler-Natta catalyst.

$$
\text{Ethylene} + \text{Propylene} + \text{Diene} \rightarrow \text{EPDM}
$$

**Applications**:
- **Automotive**: Used in weather stripping and seals for its excellent resistance to weathering and ozone.
- **Construction**: Used in roofing membranes for its durability and flexibility.

### Conclusion

Elastomers are versatile materials with unique properties that make them suitable for a wide range of applications. Their ability to undergo significant deformation and return to their original shape, combined with excellent thermal, chemical, and environmental resistance, make them indispensable in industries such as automotive, construction, consumer goods, and medical devices. Understanding the synthesis, structure, and properties of elastomers is crucial for optimizing their performance and developing new applications.
