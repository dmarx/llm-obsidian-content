### Backstepping in Nonlinear Control

Backstepping is a recursive design methodology used in [[nonlinear control]] systems to construct Lyapunov functions and controllers for stabilizing systems that can be transformed into a strict-feedback form. This technique incrementally builds the control law and Lyapunov function, ensuring stability at each step.

### Key Concepts

1. **Strict-Feedback Form**: A system is in strict-feedback form if its dynamics can be written in a recursive manner, where each state depends on the preceding state and control input.
2. **Virtual Control**: At each step of the backstepping procedure, a virtual control input is introduced to stabilize intermediate states.
3. **Lyapunov Function**: A Lyapunov function is constructed recursively to prove the stability of the system.

### Backstepping Procedure

#### Steps in Backstepping

1. **Step 1: Define the First Lyapunov Function**:
   Start with the first state and define a Lyapunov function \( V_1 \).

2. **Step 2: Introduce a Virtual Control**:
   Treat the second state as a virtual control input for the first subsystem. Define a virtual control law \( \alpha_1 \) to stabilize the first subsystem.

3. **Step 3: Extend the Lyapunov Function**:
   Define an extended Lyapunov function \( V_2 \) that includes the tracking error of the virtual control.

4. **Step 4: Design the Actual Control Input**:
   Use the actual control input \( u \) to stabilize the entire system by ensuring the time derivative of the extended Lyapunov function is negative definite.

### Example: Backstepping for a Two-State System

Consider a system with states \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \):
$$
\dot{x}_1 = f_1(x_1) + x_2,
$$
$$
\dot{x}_2 = f_2(x_1, x_2) + u.
$$

**Step 1: First Lyapunov Function**:
Define the first Lyapunov function for \( x_1 \):
$$
V_1(x_1) = \frac{1}{2} x_1^2.
$$

The time derivative of \( V_1 \) is:
$$
\dot{V}_1 = x_1 \dot{x}_1 = x_1 (f_1(x_1) + x_2).
$$

To make \( \dot{V}_1 \) negative definite, choose a virtual control \( \alpha_1 \):
$$
\alpha_1(x_1) = -k_1 x_1,
$$
where \( k_1 \) is a positive constant.

Define the tracking error for the virtual control:
$$
z_1 = x_2 - \alpha_1(x_1) = x_2 + k_1 x_1.
$$

**Step 2: Extended Lyapunov Function**:
Extend the Lyapunov function to include the error \( z_1 \):
$$
V_2(x_1, z_1) = V_1(x_1) + \frac{1}{2} z_1^2 = \frac{1}{2} x_1^2 + \frac{1}{2} (x_2 + k_1 x_1)^2.
$$

**Step 3: Control Input**:
The time derivative of \( V_2 \) is:
$$
\dot{V}_2 = x_1 \dot{x}_1 + z_1 \dot{z}_1.
$$

Using the system dynamics:
$$
\dot{z}_1 = \dot{x}_2 + k_1 \dot{x}_1 = f_2(x_1, x_2) + u + k_1 (f_1(x_1) + x_2).
$$

Substitute and simplify:
$$
\dot{V}_2 = x_1 (f_1(x_1) + x_2) + z_1 (f_2(x_1, x_2) + u + k_1 (f_1(x_1) + x_2)).
$$

To stabilize the system, choose the control law \( u \):
$$
u = -f_2(x_1, x_2) - k_1 (f_1(x_1) + x_2) - k_2 z_1,
$$
where \( k_2 \) is a positive constant. This ensures:
$$
\dot{V}_2 = -k_2 z_1^2,
$$
which is negative definite, indicating stability.

### Example: Backstepping for a Three-State System

Consider a system with states \( x_1 \), \( x_2 \), and \( x_3 \):
$$
\dot{x}_1 = x_2,
$$
$$
\dot{x}_2 = x_3,
$$
$$
\dot{x}_3 = u.
$$

**Step 1: First Lyapunov Function**:
Define the first Lyapunov function for \( x_1 \):
$$
V_1(x_1) = \frac{1}{2} x_1^2.
$$

The time derivative of \( V_1 \) is:
$$
\dot{V}_1 = x_1 \dot{x}_1 = x_1 x_2.
$$

To make \( \dot{V}_1 \) negative definite, choose a virtual control \( \alpha_1 \):
$$
\alpha_1(x_1) = -k_1 x_1,
$$
where \( k_1 \) is a positive constant.

Define the tracking error for the virtual control:
$$
z_1 = x_2 - \alpha_1(x_1) = x_2 + k_1 x_1.
$$

**Step 2: Extended Lyapunov Function**:
Extend the Lyapunov function to include the error \( z_1 \):
$$
V_2(x_1, z_1) = V_1(x_1) + \frac{1}{2} z_1^2 = \frac{1}{2} x_1^2 + \frac{1}{2} (x_2 + k_1 x_1)^2.
$$

The time derivative of \( V_2 \) is:
$$
\dot{V}_2 = x_1 \dot{x}_1 + z_1 \dot{z}_1.
$$

Using the system dynamics:
$$
\dot{z}_1 = \dot{x}_2 + k_1 \dot{x}_1 = x_3 + k_1 x_2 - k_1^2 x_1.
$$

To make \( \dot{V}_2 \) negative definite, choose a virtual control \( \alpha_2 \):
$$
\alpha_2(x_1, x_2) = -k_1 x_2 + k_1^2 x_1.
$$

Define the tracking error for the second virtual control:
$$
z_2 = x_3 - \alpha_2(x_1, x_2) = x_3 + k_1 x_2 - k_1^2 x_1.
$$

**Step 3: Extended Lyapunov Function**:
Extend the Lyapunov function to include the error \( z_2 \):
$$
V_3(x_1, z_1, z_2) = V_2(x_1, z_1) + \frac{1}{2} z_2^2 = \frac{1}{2} x_1^2 + \frac{1}{2} (x_2 + k_1 x_1)^2 + \frac{1}{2} (x_3 + k_1 x_2 - k_1^2 x_1)^2.
$$

The time derivative of \( V_3 \) is:
$$
\dot{V}_3 = x_1 \dot{x}_1 + z_1 \dot{z}_1 + z_2 \dot{z}_2.
$$

Using the system dynamics:
$$
\dot{z}_2 = \dot{x}_3 + k_1 \dot{x}_2 - k_1^2 \dot{x}_1 = u.
$$

To stabilize the system, choose the control law \( u \):
$$
u = -k_3 z_2,
$$
where \( k_3 \) is a positive constant. This ensures:
$$
\dot{V}_3 = -k_3 z_2^2,
$$
which is negative definite, indicating stability.
