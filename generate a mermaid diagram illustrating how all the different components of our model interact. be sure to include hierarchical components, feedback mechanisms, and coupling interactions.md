generate a mermaid diagram illustrating how all the different components of our model interact. be sure to include hierarchical components, feedback mechanisms, and coupling interactions


**ASSISTANT**

Here is a Mermaid diagram that illustrates the interactions, hierarchical components, feedback mechanisms, and coupling interactions of our unified model. The Mermaid code is provided, followed by an explanation of the structure:

### Explanation of the Structure:

#### Hierarchical Components:
1. **Emotion Regulation (ER)**
   - **Subcomponents**: Situation Selection (SS), Situation Modification (SM), Attentional Deployment (AD), Cognitive Change (CC), Response Modulation (RM).

2. **Motivation and Self-Determination**
   - **Intrinsic Motivation (IM)**: Influenced by Self-Determination (Intrinsic) (SDi), Self-Concordant Goals (SCG), Promotion Focus (PF).
   - **Extrinsic Motivation (EM)**: Influenced by Self-Determination (Extrinsic) (SDe), Prevention Focus (NF).
   - **Hierarchical Goals (HG)**
   - **Behavioral Intentions (BI)**: Influenced by Attitudes (Att), Subjective Norms (SN), Perceived Behavioral Control (PBC).

3. **Cognitive Processes (Working Memory Model)**
   - **Central Executive (CE)**
   - **Subcomponents**: Phonological Loop (PL), Visuospatial Sketchpad (VS), Episodic Buffer (EB).

4. **Perception and Appraisal**
   - **Cognitive Appraisal (CA)**
   - **Affect as Information (AI)**
   - **Self-Perception (SP)**
   - **Achievement Emotions (CV)**

5. **Social and Behavioral Dynamics**
   - **Self-Presentation (SPres)**
   - **Emotion Differentiation (ED)**
   - **Self-Control (Automatic) (SCa)**
   - **Self-Control (Deliberate) (SCd)**

#### Feedback Mechanisms:
- Emotion regulation influences and is influenced by intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, cognitive processes, perception, and social dynamics.
- Cognitive processes influence and are influenced by motivation and behavioral intentions.
- Perception and appraisal components feed back into motivation.
- Social and behavioral dynamics influence motivation and emotion regulation.

This detailed diagram provides a comprehensive visual representation of how the different components of our unified framework interact, highlighting hierarchical relationships, feedback loops, and the coupling of various processes.
