**USER**

pulse broadening


**ASSISTANT**

The user is asking for another wiki entry, this time on "pulse broadening". Based on the context, this should be a technical wiki entry that connects to the previous wave dispersion entry. I need to provide detailed mathematical treatment of pulse broadening phenomena, with specific focus on how pulses spread due to dispersion effects.

The user wants:
- Wiki-style content with double brackets for novel terms
- Deep technical detail with mathematical formalisms
- Concrete examples and quantitative analysis
- Symbolic notation proposals
- No conversational acknowledgment

I should cover:
- Definition of pulse broadening
- Mathematical framework
- Different types/causes of broadening
- Quantitative measures
- Physical examples (optical, acoustic, etc.)
- Connection to dispersion theory
- Information-theoretic aspects# [[Pulse Broadening]]

## Definition

[[Pulse broadening]] describes the temporal and spatial expansion of initially localized [[wave packets]] during propagation through dispersive media. This phenomenon arises from the frequency-dependent [[phase velocity]] inherent in [[wave dispersion]], causing different [[spectral components]] within the pulse to accumulate differential phase delays.

## Mathematical Framework

### Temporal Pulse Evolution

For a pulse with initial [[temporal profile]] $u(t,0)$ and [[spectral amplitude]] $\tilde{u}(\omega,0)$, the evolved pulse becomes:
$$u(t,z) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \tilde{u}(\omega,0) \exp(-i\omega t + i\beta(\omega)z) d\omega$$

where $\beta(\omega)$ represents the [[propagation constant]] and $z$ denotes the propagation distance.

### Taylor Series Expansion

Expanding $\beta(\omega)$ around the [[carrier frequency]] $\omega_0$:
$$\beta(\omega) = \beta_0 + \beta_1(\omega-\omega_0) + \frac{1}{2}\beta_2(\omega-\omega_0)^2 + \frac{1}{6}\beta_3(\omega-\omega_0)^3 + \cdots$$

where:
- $\beta_0 = \beta(\omega_0)$ ([[propagation phase]])
- $\beta_1 = \frac{d\beta}{d\omega}\bigg|_{\omega_0} = \frac{1}{v_g}$ ([[group delay]])
- $\beta_2 = \frac{d^2\beta}{d\omega^2}\bigg|_{\omega_0}$ ([[group velocity dispersion]])
- $\beta_3 = \frac{d^3\beta}{d\omega^3}\bigg|_{\omega_0}$ ([[third-order dispersion]])

### Gaussian Pulse Analysis

Consider an initial [[Gaussian pulse]]:
$$u(t,0) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} \frac{1}{T_0} \exp\left(-\frac{t^2}{T_0^2}\right) \exp(-i\omega_0 t)$$

where $T_0$ represents the initial [[pulse width]] (1/e half-width).

After propagation distance $z$, the pulse becomes:
$$u(t,z) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} \frac{1}{T(z)} \exp\left(-\frac{(t-\beta_1 z)^2}{T(z)^2}\right) \exp(-i\omega_0(t-\beta_1 z) + i\phi(z))$$

### Broadening Factor

The [[temporal broadening factor]] is:
$$T(z) = T_0 \sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{z}{L_D}\right)^2}$$

where $L_D$ is the [[dispersion length]]:
$$L_D = \frac{T_0^2}{|\beta_2|}$$

## Quantitative Measures

### Root-Mean-Square Width Evolution

The [[RMS pulse width]] evolves as:
$$\sigma_t(z) = \sqrt{\sigma_{t0}^2 + \left(\frac{\beta_2 z \sigma_{\omega0}}{\sigma_{t0}}\right)^2}$$

where $\sigma_{t0}$ and $\sigma_{\omega0}$ represent initial temporal and spectral RMS widths, respectively.

### Broadening Ratio

The [[pulse broadening ratio]] quantifies temporal expansion:
$$R_b(z) = \frac{T(z)}{T_0} = \sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{z}{L_D}\right)^2}$$

### Quality Factor

The [[pulse quality factor]] measures preservation of temporal coherence:
$$Q(z) = \frac{1}{R_b(z)} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + (z/L_D)^2}}$$

## Physical Mechanisms

### Chromatic Dispersion

In optical fibers, [[chromatic dispersion]] arises from:

**Material Dispersion**: Frequency-dependent [[refractive index]]
$$\beta_2^{(mat)} = \frac{\lambda^3}{2\pi c^2} \frac{d^2n}{d\lambda^2}$$

**Waveguide Dispersion**: Modal [[effective index]] dependence
$$\beta_2^{(wg)} = -\frac{n_2 \Delta}{c\lambda} \frac{d^2(b V)}{dV^2}$$

where $V$ is the [[normalized frequency]] and $b$ is the [[normalized propagation constant]].

### Modal Dispersion

In [[multimode systems]], different propagation modes exhibit distinct [[group velocities]], leading to [[intermodal broadening]]:
$$\sigma_{modal} = \frac{\Delta n_{eff}}{c} L$$

where $\Delta n_{eff}$ represents the [[effective index difference]] between modes.

### Polarization Mode Dispersion

[[Birefringence]] in optical fibers causes [[polarization-dependent delays]]:
$$\sigma_{PMD} = D_{PMD} \sqrt{L}$$

where $D_{PMD}$ is the [[PMD coefficient]] and the square-root dependence reflects [[random coupling]] between polarization modes.

## Higher-Order Effects

### Third-Order Dispersion

The [[third-order correction]] introduces asymmetric broadening:
$$u(t,z) \propto \exp\left(-\frac{t^2}{T^2} + i\frac{\beta_3 z}{6T_0^3}t^3\right)$$

### Self-Phase Modulation

[[Nonlinear effects]] modify the [[instantaneous frequency]]:
$$\omega_{inst}(t) = \omega_0 - \gamma P(t) z$$

where $\gamma$ is the [[nonlinear coefficient]] and $P(t)$ represents the [[temporal power profile]].

## Information-Theoretic Analysis

### Channel Capacity Degradation

Pulse broadening reduces [[information transmission capacity]] through [[intersymbol interference]]. The [[Shannon capacity]] becomes:
$$C = B \log_2(1 + \text{SNR}_{eff})$$

where $\text{SNR}_{eff}$ accounts for broadening-induced [[signal degradation]].

### Mutual Information

The [[mutual information]] between input and output pulse sequences:
$$I(X;Y) = H(Y) - H(Y|X) = H(X) - H(X|Y)$$

decreases as broadening increases [[conditional entropy]] $H(X|Y)$.

### Error Probability

For [[binary signaling]], the [[bit error rate]] due to pulse overlap:
$$P_e \approx \frac{1}{2}\text{erfc}\left(\frac{Q}{\sqrt{2}}\right)$$

where $Q$ is the [[Q-factor]] relating signal-to-noise ratio to pulse broadening.

## Compensation Techniques

### Dispersion Compensation

[[Dispersion-compensating fiber]] with opposite dispersion sign:
$$\beta_2^{(total)} = \beta_2^{(fiber)} L + \beta_2^{(DCF)} L_{DCF} = 0$$

### Electronic Dispersion Compensation

[[Digital signal processing]] techniques apply inverse dispersion:
$$H(\omega) = \exp\left(i\frac{\beta_2 z \omega^2}{2}\right)$$

### Soliton Propagation

[[Nonlinear solitons]] maintain constant pulse width through balance of dispersion and [[self-phase modulation]]:
$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial z} + \frac{i\beta_2}{2}\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} + i\gamma|u|^2 u = 0$$

## Measurement Techniques

### Autocorrelation

[[Intensity autocorrelation]] measures broadened pulse width:
$$G^{(2)}(\tau) = \frac{\langle I(t)I(t+\tau)\rangle}{\langle I(t)\rangle^2}$$

### Cross-Correlation

[[Cross-correlation]] with reference pulse provides temporal resolution:
$$G_{12}(\tau) = \int I_1(t)I_2(t+\tau) dt$$

### Frequency-Resolved Optical Gating

[[FROG traces]] reconstruct complete pulse [[amplitude and phase]]:
$$I_{FROG}(\omega,\tau) = \left|\int I(t)g(t-\tau)e^{-i\omega t} dt\right|^2$$

## Symbolic Notation Framework

Define the [[broadening operator]] $\mathcal{B}_z$:
$$\mathcal{B}_z[u(t)] = \mathcal{F}^{-1}\left[\mathcal{F}[u(t)] \exp(i\beta(\omega)z)\right]$$

The [[cumulative broadening function]] $\mathcal{R}(z)$:
$$\mathcal{R}(z) = \sqrt{1 + \int_0^z \frac{|\beta_2(z')|^2}{L_D(z')^2} dz'}$$

The [[broadening susceptibility]] $\chi_b$:
$$\chi_b = \frac{d^2\beta}{d\omega^2} \bigg/ \frac{d\beta}{d\omega}$$

## Applications and Examples

### Optical Communication Systems

[[Fiber-optic communication]] systems experience broadening-limited transmission:
- [[Standard single-mode fiber]]: $\beta_2 \approx 17$ psÂ²/km at 1550 nm
- [[Dispersion-shifted fiber]]: Zero dispersion at 1550 nm
- [[Non-zero dispersion-shifted fiber]]: Reduced nonlinear effects

### Ultrafast Laser Systems

[[Femtosecond pulses]] broaden rapidly in dispersive media:
$$T_{FWHM} = T_0 \sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{4\ln(2) z}{L_D}\right)^2}$$

### Radar and Sonar Systems

[[Pulse compression]] techniques mitigate broadening in [[matched filter]] systems:
$$\rho(\tau) = \int s(t)s^*(t-\tau) dt$$
