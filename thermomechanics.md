Thermomechanics


**ASSISTANT**

Thermomechanics is a field that integrates the principles of thermodynamics and mechanics to describe the behavior of materials under the influence of both thermal and mechanical loads. This interdisciplinary approach is crucial for understanding how materials deform, flow, and fail when subjected to temperature changes and mechanical forces.

### Fundamental Concepts

#### Thermodynamic Principles

1. **First Law of Thermodynamics (Energy Conservation)**
   $$
   \frac{dU}{dt} = \dot{Q} - \dot{W}
   $$
   where \(U\) is the internal energy, \(\dot{Q}\) is the heat added to the system, and \(\dot{W}\) is the work done by the system.

2. **Second Law of Thermodynamics (Entropy Production)**
   $$
   \frac{dS}{dt} \geq \frac{\dot{Q}}{T}
   $$
   where \(S\) is the entropy and \(T\) is the absolute temperature. This law states that the entropy of an isolated system never decreases.

#### Mechanical Principles

1. **Conservation of Momentum**
   $$
   \frac{\partial (\rho \mathbf{u})}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{u} \otimes \mathbf{u}) = \nabla \cdot \mathbf{\sigma} + \rho \mathbf{g}
   $$
   where \(\rho\) is the density, \(\mathbf{u}\) is the velocity field, \(\mathbf{\sigma}\) is the stress tensor, and \(\mathbf{g}\) is the gravitational acceleration.

2. **Conservation of Mass**
   $$
   \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{u}) = 0
   $$

### Coupled Thermomechanical Equations

#### Energy Equation

The energy equation for a thermomechanical system combines the principles of energy conservation and heat conduction:

$$
\rho c \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} + \rho c \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla T = \nabla \cdot (k \nabla T) + \mathbf{\sigma} : \nabla \mathbf{u} + q
$$

where:
- \(c\) is the specific heat capacity,
- \(k\) is the thermal conductivity,
- \(T\) is the temperature,
- \(\mathbf{\sigma} : \nabla \mathbf{u}\) represents the mechanical work done,
- \(q\) is the internal heat generation per unit volume.

#### Constitutive Relations

Thermoelastic materials are often described by constitutive relations that couple mechanical deformation and temperature changes.

1. **Stress-Strain Relationship:**
   $$
   \mathbf{\sigma} = \mathbf{C} : (\mathbf{E} - \alpha (T - T_0) \mathbf{I})
   $$
   where:
   - \(\mathbf{C}\) is the elasticity tensor,
   - \(\mathbf{E}\) is the strain tensor,
   - \(\alpha\) is the thermal expansion coefficient,
   - \(T_0\) is the reference temperature,
   - \(\mathbf{I}\) is the identity tensor.

2. **Heat Conduction (Fourier's Law):**
   $$
   \mathbf{q} = -k \nabla T
   $$

### Thermomechanical Phenomena

#### Thermal Expansion

When materials are heated, they tend to expand. The change in length \(\Delta L\) of a material due to a temperature change \(\Delta T\) is given by:

$$
\Delta L = \alpha L_0 \Delta T
$$

where \(L_0\) is the original length and \(\alpha\) is the coefficient of thermal expansion.

#### Thermoelastic Stress

Thermal stresses develop in a material when it undergoes non-uniform temperature changes, leading to differential expansion or contraction. These stresses can be significant, especially in constrained materials.

#### Thermoviscoelasticity

In viscoelastic materials, both temperature and time-dependent mechanical behavior must be considered. The constitutive relation for thermoviscoelasticity might involve temperature-dependent relaxation times and moduli.

### Example: Thermoelastic Analysis of a Cylinder

Consider a long, thin-walled cylinder subjected to a temperature change \(\Delta T\). The radial and circumferential stresses due to thermal expansion are:

**Radial Stress:**
$$
\sigma_r = 0 \quad \text{(free surface condition)}
$$

**Circumferential Stress:**
$$
\sigma_\theta = \frac{E \alpha \Delta T}{1 - \nu}
$$

where:
- \(E\) is the Young's modulus,
- \(\nu\) is the Poisson's ratio.

### Numerical Methods

Solving the coupled thermomechanical equations often requires numerical methods due to their complexity. Common techniques include:

1. **Finite Element Method (FEM):** Used for solving complex geometries and boundary conditions. FEM discretizes the domain into elements and solves the governing equations iteratively.

2. **Finite Difference Method (FDM):** Approximates the PDEs using difference equations, suitable for simpler geometries.

3. **Multiphysics Software:** Tools like COMSOL Multiphysics and ANSYS provide integrated environments for solving coupled thermomechanical problems.

### Conclusion

Thermomechanics integrates thermal and mechanical analyses to provide a comprehensive understanding of material behavior under combined loading conditions. It finds applications in a wide range of fields, from aerospace engineering to materials science and civil engineering.
