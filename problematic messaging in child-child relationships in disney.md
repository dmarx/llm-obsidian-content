problematic messaging in child-child relationships in disney


**ASSISTANT**

Disney's portrayal of child-child relationships in its films and TV shows often focuses on themes of friendship, loyalty, and collaboration. However, these narratives can sometimes convey problematic messages that might influence young viewers' understanding of social interactions and peer relationships. Here are some concerns regarding how these relationships are depicted:

### 1. **Conflict Resolution Oversimplified**
- **Quick Fixes to Complex Issues:** 
  - Disney narratives often resolve conflicts between children very quickly and without much realistic communication or negotiation. For example, issues of betrayal or deep-seated jealousy are sometimes solved with a simple apology or a grand gesture, bypassing the often messy, drawn-out process of genuine reconciliation found in real life.

### 2. **Reinforcement of Cliques and Exclusion**
- **Promotion of In-Groups and Out-Groups:** 
  - Films like "Mean Girls" and even the dynamics within "High School Musical" show cliques and exclusive groups, where acceptance by a particular group is portrayed as crucial to social success. This can perpetuate the idea that social value is tied to being part of "elite" or popular groups.

### 3. **Stereotyping and Typecasting**
- **Character Roles Based on Stereotypes:** 
  - Disney often uses easily recognizable stereotypes for child characters, such as the "nerd," the "jock," the "princess," and the "rebel." While these characters sometimes evolve, the initial reliance on stereotypes can reinforce simplistic views of identity, influencing children to categorize peers based on superficial traits.

### 4. **Dependency on Peer Approval**
- **Validation Through Others:** 
  - Many Disney stories center on characters whose actions are heavily influenced by the desire to gain peer approval or fit into certain social groups. This can send a message that personal worth or happiness is largely dependent on being liked or accepted by others, potentially undermining self-esteem and individuality.

### 5. **Hero and Villain Dynamics Among Children**
- **Clear Dichotomies of Good vs. Evil:** 
  - In some Disney narratives, child characters are distinctly labeled as heroes or villains, with little room for nuance. This black-and-white thinking can encourage children to view peers through a similarly uncompromising lens, promoting judgment rather than understanding or empathy.

### 6. **Bullying and Its Resolution**
- **Glamorization or Simplification of Bullying:** 
  - While Disney films like "Wreck-It Ralph" address themes of bullying, the resolution is often idealistic, with bullies quickly changing their ways following a pivotal moment of revelation. This may not adequately represent the complex nature of bullying or the difficulty of changing such behaviors in real-life situations.

### 7. **Importance of Competitiveness**
- **Overemphasis on Competition:** 
  - Disney plots often hinge on competitions or confrontations where one child must outdo others to succeed. This can emphasize a competitive nature over collaborative values, suggesting that success at the expense of others is a desirable or necessary path to achievement.

While Disney has taken steps to introduce more complex and realistic child characters in recent productions, addressing these problematic elements involves a greater focus on depicting realistic, nuanced interactions and promoting a broader range of values in child-child relationships. Such narratives would better reflect the diversity of real social experiences and encourage more constructive attitudes and behaviors among young audiences.
