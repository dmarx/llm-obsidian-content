### Conversation Theory

**Conversation Theory**, developed by [[Gordon Pask]] in the 1970s, is a framework for understanding how knowledge is constructed and shared through interaction. Rooted in [[cybernetics]] and [[systems theory]], it models learning as a dynamic, dialogic process where participants (referred to as "conversational entities") exchange information, adjust their understanding, and reach a shared comprehension of a topic or task.

### Core Concepts of Conversation Theory

#### 1. **Conversation as a System**
A conversation is modeled as a self-regulating system where participants engage in iterative feedback loops to achieve mutual understanding. The process involves:
- **Assertions:** Statements of knowledge or ideas.
- **Questions:** Requests for clarification or additional information.
- **Feedback:** Responses that validate, modify, or challenge assertions.

#### 2. **Learning as Interaction**
Learning occurs when two or more participants in a conversation establish shared meaning through the construction and negotiation of knowledge. This process involves two primary types of learning:
- **Operative Learning:** Focuses on how tasks are performed (procedural knowledge).
- **Conceptual Learning:** Deals with abstract ideas and principles (declarative knowledge).

#### 3. **Teachback and Reciprocal Understanding**
A critical feature of Conversation Theory is **teachback**, where one participant explains their understanding to the other. This helps ensure mutual comprehension and aligns perspectives:
- The learner demonstrates their understanding by explaining it in their own words.
- The teacher provides feedback, refining the learner's understanding.

#### 4. **Agreement and Disagreement**
Conversations may progress toward **agreement** or may highlight **disagreement**. In either case, the dialogue fosters a deeper exploration of the topic:
- Agreement establishes shared meaning.
- Disagreement reveals areas requiring clarification or alternative perspectives.

#### 5. **Closure**
The conversation achieves **closure** when participants reach a shared understanding or when the dialogic process is intentionally terminated, leaving some differences unresolved.

### Formal Model of Conversation

Conversation Theory uses a formal, cybernetic model to represent the dialogic process. Key components include:

1. **Participants as Systems**
   - Each participant in the conversation is modeled as an adaptive system capable of generating and responding to information.

2. **Interaction Channels**
   - Information flows between participants through specific channels, which may include verbal communication, written text, or visual aids.

3. **Topics as Conceptual Structures**
   - Knowledge is represented as a structure of interconnected concepts. Learning involves mapping these structures between participants.

4. **Feedback Loops**
   - Feedback is essential for validating or modifying understanding. This iterative process allows participants to adapt their mental models.

### Principles of Conversation Theory

#### 1. **Psychological Individuality**
Each participant has a unique cognitive framework shaped by their prior knowledge and experiences. Conversations adapt to these individual differences.

#### 2. **Negotiation of Meaning**
The process of learning and teaching is a negotiation where participants collaboratively build a shared understanding.

#### 3. **Adaptation and Control**
Conversations are self-regulating systems. Feedback mechanisms allow participants to detect misunderstandings and adjust their communication strategies.

#### 4. **Levels of Learning**
Pask identified three levels of learning within conversations:
- **First-Order Learning:** Acquiring new facts or skills.
- **Second-Order Learning:** Understanding the principles or strategies behind the facts.
- **Third-Order Learning:** Reflecting on and transforming one's own learning processes.

### Applications of Conversation Theory

#### 1. **Education**
- Supports interactive teaching methods where students actively construct knowledge through dialogue with teachers and peers.
- Used in designing adaptive learning systems and personalized education technologies.

#### 2. **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**
- Conversation Theory informs the design of interactive systems and virtual assistants that simulate human-like dialogue and learning processes.

#### 3. **Organizational Learning**
- Facilitates collaborative problem-solving and decision-making in organizations by promoting shared understanding among team members.

#### 4. **Artificial Intelligence and Chatbots**
- Influences the development of conversational AI systems capable of teaching, learning, and adapting through dialogue.

#### 5. **Therapeutic Practices**
- Applied in counseling and therapy, where conversational exchange helps individuals explore and modify their perspectives.

### Mathematical Representation

In formal terms, a conversation can be modeled as a process of mutual state adaptation:
$$
\mathbf{S}_1(t+1) = f_1(\mathbf{S}_1(t), \mathbf{S}_2(t), \mathbf{I}_1(t)),
$$
$$
\mathbf{S}_2(t+1) = f_2(\mathbf{S}_2(t), \mathbf{S}_1(t), \mathbf{I}_2(t)),
$$
where:
- \( \mathbf{S}_1, \mathbf{S}_2 \): States of participants 1 and 2, respectively.
- \( \mathbf{I}_1, \mathbf{I}_2 \): Inputs (e.g., questions or assertions) from each participant.
- \( f_1, f_2 \): Adaptation functions representing how participants process inputs and adjust their states.

### Critiques and Extensions

1. **Critiques**
   - The formalism can be challenging to apply in large-scale, multi-agent interactions.
   - The theory focuses heavily on idealized conversations, which may not always align with real-world complexities.

2. **Extensions**
   - [[Second-Order Cybernetics]] extends Conversation Theory by emphasizing the observer's role in shaping the conversation.
   - Integration with [[Artificial Intelligence]] has advanced conversational models for adaptive learning systems.
