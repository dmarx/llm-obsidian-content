# Spectral Decomposition Through Universal Algebra

[[Spectral decomposition]] represents a fundamental unifying concept that encompasses both [[Singular Value Decomposition]] (SVD) and [[Fourier analysis]] as special cases. At their core, both techniques leverage the decomposition of mathematical objects into simpler components using [[eigenvectors]] and [[eigenvalues]], or more generally, [[spectral theory]].

## Categorical Perspective

In the language of [[category theory]], both SVD and Fourier analysis can be viewed as instances of a more general decomposition functor:

Let **C** be a category with objects that admit some notion of [[inner product structure]]. Define a functor:

F: **C** → **Spec(C)**

where **Spec(C)** is the category of spectral representations. This functor maps objects to their spectral decompositions while preserving the relevant algebraic structure.

## Algebraic Structure

The underlying algebraic structure can be formalized through [[group representation theory]]. Both techniques decompose objects into:

1. A collection of [[simple objects]] (eigenvectors/basis functions)
2. Associated [[scaling factors]] (singular values/Fourier coefficients)
3. A [[reconstruction formula]] combining these components

Formally, given a [[vector space]] V with an [[operator]] T: V → V, both techniques seek a decomposition:

T = ∑ᵢ λᵢPᵢ

where:
- λᵢ are scalars (eigenvalues/frequencies)
- Pᵢ are [[projection operators]] onto simple subspaces

## Key Correspondences

| SVD | Fourier Analysis | General Case |
|-----|------------------|--------------|
| Singular vectors | Complex exponentials | [[Eigenfunctions]] |
| Singular values | Fourier coefficients | [[Spectral values]] |
| Matrix multiplication | Convolution | [[Operator composition]] |

## Universal Property

Both decompositions satisfy a [[universal property]]: they provide the optimal approximation of the original object in terms of simpler components, where "optimal" is defined with respect to the relevant norm structure.

For a [[normed space]] X and operator T, the decomposition minimizes:

||T - T'||

where T' ranges over operators of rank ≤ k (for some fixed k).

## Generalizations

This framework extends to other domains:
- [[Wavelets]] as localized basis functions
- [[Karhunen-Loève transform]] for stochastic processes
- [[Spherical harmonics]] for functions on spheres
- [[Laplace-Beltrami operator]] eigenfunctions on manifolds

The key insight is that whenever we have:
1. A space with inner product structure
2. A group of symmetries
3. A notion of "simple" or "elementary" objects

We can construct a spectral decomposition that optimally represents objects in terms of these simpler components.

## Mathematical Formalization

Let (V, ⟨·,·⟩) be a [[Hilbert space]] and T: V → V be a [[compact operator]]. The general spectral decomposition theorem states:

T = ∑ᵢ σᵢ |uᵢ⟩⟨vᵢ|

where:
- σᵢ are the [[singular values]]
- |uᵢ⟩ and |vᵢ⟩ are the left and right [[singular vectors]]
- The outer product |uᵢ⟩⟨vᵢ| denotes the rank-one operator mapping x ↦ ⟨vᵢ,x⟩uᵢ

This formulation unifies the matrix SVD and the Fourier transform, with the latter corresponding to the special case where T is a [[translation-invariant operator]] and the singular vectors are the complex exponentials.
