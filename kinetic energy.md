Kinetic energy


**ASSISTANT**

*[[Kinetic Energy]]* is a form of energy that an object possesses due to its motion. It is one of the most fundamental concepts in classical mechanics and plays a crucial role in understanding the dynamics of moving bodies.

### Definition

The kinetic energy \(K\) of an object with mass \(m\) moving with velocity \(\mathbf{v}\) is given by:
$$
K = \frac{1}{2} m v^2
$$
where \(v\) is the magnitude of the velocity vector \(\mathbf{v}\).

### Derivation

The expression for kinetic energy can be derived from the work-energy theorem. Consider a constant force \(\mathbf{F}\) acting on an object causing it to accelerate from an initial velocity \(\mathbf{v}_i\) to a final velocity \(\mathbf{v}_f\) over a displacement \(\mathbf{d}\). The work done by the force is:
$$
W = \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{d}
$$

Using Newton's second law, \(\mathbf{F} = m \mathbf{a}\), where \(\mathbf{a}\) is the acceleration, and knowing that \(\mathbf{d} = \frac{1}{2} (\mathbf{v}_i + \mathbf{v}_f) t\) for constant acceleration, we can rewrite the work as:
$$
W = m \mathbf{a} \cdot \frac{1}{2} (\mathbf{v}_i + \mathbf{v}_f) t
$$

Since \(\mathbf{a} = \frac{\mathbf{v}_f - \mathbf{v}_i}{t}\), the work becomes:
$$
W = m \frac{\mathbf{v}_f - \mathbf{v}_i}{t} \cdot \frac{1}{2} (\mathbf{v}_i + \mathbf{v}_f) t
$$

Simplifying, we obtain:
$$
W = \frac{1}{2} m (\mathbf{v}_f^2 - \mathbf{v}_i^2)
$$

This shows that the work done by the net force results in a change in the kinetic energy:
$$
W = \Delta K = \frac{1}{2} m v_f^2 - \frac{1}{2} m v_i^2
$$

### Properties

1. **Scalar Quantity**: Kinetic energy is a scalar quantity, meaning it has magnitude but no direction.
2. **Always Non-Negative**: Since it depends on the square of the velocity, kinetic energy is always non-negative.
3. **Frame of Reference**: Kinetic energy is frame-dependent. The kinetic energy of an object can vary depending on the observer's frame of reference.

### Types of Kinetic Energy

1. **Translational Kinetic Energy**: This is the kinetic energy associated with the linear motion of an object and is given by the standard formula \(K = \frac{1}{2} m v^2\).

2. **Rotational Kinetic Energy**: For an object rotating about an axis, the kinetic energy is given by:
   $$
   K_{\text{rot}} = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2
   $$
   where \(I\) is the moment of inertia and \(\omega\) is the angular velocity.

### Examples

1. **Free-Falling Object**: An object of mass \(m\) falling freely under gravity from a height \(h\) acquires kinetic energy as it falls. If it starts from rest, its kinetic energy just before hitting the ground is \(K = mgh\), where \(h\) is the height fallen.

2. **Moving Car**: A car of mass \(m\) traveling at a velocity \(v\) has kinetic energy \(K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2\). If the car accelerates to double its speed, its kinetic energy increases by a factor of four.

### Work-Energy Theorem and Kinetic Energy

The work-energy theorem directly links the work done by forces on an object to its kinetic energy. Specifically, the net work done by all forces acting on an object results in a change in the object's kinetic energy:
$$
W_{\text{net}} = \Delta K = K_f - K_i
$$

### Conclusion

Kinetic energy is a critical concept in the analysis of mechanical systems, describing the energy associated with the motion of objects. It plays a fundamental role in the principles of conservation of energy and dynamics. For further details, see [[Potential Energy]], [[Work (physics)|Work]], and [[Conservation of Energy]].
