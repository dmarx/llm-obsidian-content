overdamped langevin


**ASSISTANT**

The **overdamped Langevin equation** describes the dynamics of a particle in a medium where inertial effects are negligible compared to the viscous forces. This regime is also known as the Smoluchowski regime. It is particularly relevant for systems in which friction dominates over mass, such as in the motion of colloidal particles in a fluid.

### Langevin Equation

The general Langevin equation for a particle of mass $m$ in a potential $V(x)$, subjected to a damping force and a random force, is given by:
$$
m \ddot{x} + \gamma \dot{x} = -\frac{\partial V(x)}{\partial x} + \sqrt{2\gamma k_B T} \eta(t),
$$
where:
- $x$ is the position of the particle,
- $\gamma$ is the friction coefficient,
- $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant,
- $T$ is the temperature,
- $\eta(t)$ is a delta-correlated Gaussian white noise with $\langle \eta(t) \rangle = 0$ and $\langle \eta(t) \eta(t') \rangle = \delta(t - t')$.

### Overdamped (Smoluchowski) Regime

In the overdamped regime, the inertial term $m \ddot{x}$ is negligible compared to the damping term $\gamma \dot{x}$. Therefore, the Langevin equation simplifies to:
$$
\gamma \dot{x} = -\frac{\partial V(x)}{\partial x} + \sqrt{2\gamma k_B T} \eta(t).
$$

### Overdamped Langevin Equation

The overdamped Langevin equation can be written as:
$$
\dot{x} = -\frac{1}{\gamma} \frac{\partial V(x)}{\partial x} + \sqrt{\frac{2 k_B T}{\gamma}} \eta(t).
$$

### Fokker-Planck Equation

The Fokker-Planck equation describes the time evolution of the probability density function $P(x, t)$ for the position of the particle. The Fokker-Planck equation corresponding to the overdamped Langevin equation is:
$$
\frac{\partial P(x, t)}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( \frac{1}{\gamma} \frac{\partial V(x)}{\partial x} P(x, t) \right) + \frac{k_B T}{\gamma} \frac{\partial^2 P(x, t)}{\partial x^2}.
$$

### Steady-State Solution

In the steady state ($\partial P(x, t) / \partial t = 0$), the Fokker-Planck equation becomes:
$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( \frac{1}{\gamma} \frac{\partial V(x)}{\partial x} P_{\text{ss}}(x) \right) + \frac{k_B T}{\gamma} \frac{\partial^2 P_{\text{ss}}(x)}{\partial x^2} = 0,
$$
where $P_{\text{ss}}(x)$ is the steady-state probability density function.

This equation can be solved to yield the Boltzmann distribution:
$$
P_{\text{ss}}(x) = \frac{1}{Z} e^{-\frac{V(x)}{k_B T}},
$$
where $Z$ is the normalization constant (partition function):
$$
Z = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-\frac{V(x)}{k_B T}} \, dx.
$$

### Applications

1. **Brownian Motion**: The overdamped Langevin equation describes the motion of colloidal particles in a fluid, where the inertia of the particles is negligible.
2. **Biological Systems**: It is used to model the dynamics of molecules and other small entities in biological environments, where viscous forces are dominant.
3. **Polymer Physics**: The motion of polymers in a solvent can often be described using the overdamped Langevin equation.
4. **Financial Mathematics**: The overdamped Langevin equation has applications in modeling stochastic processes in finance, such as stock prices or interest rates, in highly viscous environments.

### Example: Harmonic Potential

Consider a particle in a harmonic potential $V(x) = \frac{1}{2} k x^2$. The overdamped Langevin equation is:
$$
\dot{x} = -\frac{k}{\gamma} x + \sqrt{\frac{2 k_B T}{\gamma}} \eta(t).
$$

The corresponding Fokker-Planck equation is:
$$
\frac{\partial P(x, t)}{\partial t} = \frac{k}{\gamma} \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( x P(x, t) \right) + \frac{k_B T}{\gamma} \frac{\partial^2 P(x, t)}{\partial x^2}.
$$

The steady-state solution is the Gaussian distribution:
$$
P_{\text{ss}}(x) = \sqrt{\frac{k}{2 \pi k_B T}} \exp \left( -\frac{k x^2}{2 k_B T} \right).
$$

### Conclusion

The overdamped Langevin equation is a fundamental model for systems where friction dominates over inertia. It provides a framework for understanding the stochastic dynamics of particles in various potentials and is widely applicable in physics, chemistry, biology, and finance.
