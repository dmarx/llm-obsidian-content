### Additional Cognitive Modules

Here are additional cognitive modules with strong evidentiary support, expanding on the brain's specialized capabilities beyond those already discussed:

#### 51. **Numerosity Module**

##### Intraparietal Sulcus (IPS)

- **Location**: The IPS is located in the parietal lobe.
- **Function**: Specialized for processing numerical quantities and understanding numerical concepts.

##### Evidence Supporting the Numerosity Module

- **Behavioral Studies**: Infants as young as six months can distinguish between different quantities, indicating an innate ability to process numerical information.
- **Neuroimaging Studies**: fMRI studies show activation in the IPS during tasks involving number comparison and arithmetic operations.
- **Acalculia**: Damage to the IPS can result in acalculia, a specific impairment in numerical processing.

#### 52. **Semantic Memory Module**

##### Anterior Temporal Lobes

- **Location**: The anterior temporal lobes are located in the temporal lobe.
- **Function**: Involved in the storage and retrieval of general knowledge and facts, independent of personal experience.

##### Evidence Supporting the Semantic Memory Module

- **Semantic Dementia**: Degeneration of the anterior temporal lobes results in semantic dementia, where individuals lose knowledge about concepts and facts.
- **Neuroimaging Studies**: fMRI studies show activation in the anterior temporal lobes during tasks that require accessing semantic memory.
- **Lesion Studies**: Damage to these areas impairs semantic memory while leaving episodic memory relatively intact.

#### 53. **Face Identity Recognition Module**

##### Fusiform Face Area (FFA)

- **Location**: The FFA is located in the fusiform gyrus on the ventral surface of the temporal lobe.
- **Function**: Specialized for recognizing and distinguishing individual faces.

##### Evidence Supporting the Face Identity Recognition Module

- **Prosopagnosia**: Individuals with damage to the FFA often suffer from prosopagnosia, where they cannot recognize familiar faces despite intact object recognition.
- **Neuroimaging Studies**: fMRI studies show selective activation of the FFA when individuals view faces compared to other objects.
- **Developmental Evidence**: Infants show a preference for face-like stimuli shortly after birth, indicating an innate face recognition system.

#### 54. **Social Inference Module**

##### Temporoparietal Junction (TPJ)

- **Location**: The TPJ is located at the boundary of the temporal and parietal lobes.
- **Function**: Involved in inferring others' thoughts, intentions, and beliefs (also known as Theory of Mind).

##### Evidence Supporting the Social Inference Module

- **Neuroimaging Studies**: fMRI studies show activation in the TPJ during tasks that require understanding others' mental states.
- **Developmental Milestones**: Children typically develop the ability to infer others' beliefs around age 4-5, suggesting a specialized cognitive module.
- **Clinical Evidence**: Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) often show impairments in Theory of Mind, associated with atypical functioning in the TPJ.

#### 55. **Phonological Processing Module**

##### Superior Temporal Gyrus (STG)

- **Location**: The STG is located in the temporal lobe.
- **Function**: Specialized for processing phonological aspects of language, including recognizing and manipulating speech sounds.

##### Evidence Supporting the Phonological Processing Module

- **Dyslexia**: Individuals with dyslexia often have abnormalities in the STG, which are associated with difficulties in phonological processing and reading.
- **Neuroimaging Studies**: fMRI studies show activation in the STG during tasks that involve phonological processing, such as rhyming and sound discrimination.
- **Behavioral Studies**: Experiments demonstrate that phonological awareness is crucial for language acquisition and literacy.

#### 56. **Body Schema Module**

##### Posterior Parietal Cortex (PPC)

- **Location**: The PPC is located in the parietal lobe.
- **Function**: Involved in creating and maintaining a representation of the bodyâ€™s position and movement in space.

##### Evidence Supporting the Body Schema Module

- **Lesion Studies**: Damage to the PPC can result in disorders like hemineglect, where individuals ignore one side of their body or space.
- **Neuroimaging Studies**: fMRI studies show activation in the PPC during tasks that require awareness of body position and movement.
- **Behavioral Studies**: Research shows that the PPC integrates sensory and motor information to maintain an accurate body schema.

#### 57. **Conflict Monitoring Module**

##### Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC)

- **Location**: The ACC is located in the frontal lobe.
- **Function**: Specialized for detecting and monitoring cognitive conflicts and errors.

##### Evidence Supporting the Conflict Monitoring Module

- **Error-Related Negativity (ERN)**: Electrophysiological studies show that the ACC generates an ERN signal following errors, indicating its role in conflict monitoring.
- **Neuroimaging Studies**: fMRI studies show activation in the ACC during tasks that involve high cognitive conflict or error detection.
- **Lesion Studies**: Damage to the ACC impairs the ability to monitor and resolve cognitive conflicts, resulting in increased error rates.

#### 58. **Visuospatial Attention Module**

##### Lateral Intraparietal Area (LIP)

- **Location**: The LIP is located in the parietal lobe.
- **Function**: Involved in directing attention to different locations in the visual field.

##### Evidence Supporting the Visuospatial Attention Module

- **Neuroimaging Studies**: fMRI studies show activation in the LIP during tasks that require shifting visual attention.
- **Single-Cell Recording**: Studies in non-human primates show that neurons in the LIP respond selectively to attentional shifts in the visual field.
- **Behavioral Studies**: Research demonstrates that the LIP is critical for tasks that involve scanning the environment and focusing on relevant stimuli.

#### 59. **Predictive Coding Module**

##### Inferior Frontal Gyrus (IFG)

- **Location**: The IFG is located in the frontal lobe.
- **Function**: Involved in generating and updating predictions about sensory inputs.

##### Evidence Supporting the Predictive Coding Module

- **Neuroimaging Studies**: fMRI studies show activation in the IFG during tasks that require making predictions about incoming sensory information.
- **Behavioral Studies**: Experiments indicate that predictive coding helps individuals anticipate and interpret sensory stimuli more efficiently.
- **Comparative Evidence**: Similar predictive coding mechanisms are observed in other animals, suggesting an evolutionary basis for this module.

### Integrative Perspectives and Further Research
