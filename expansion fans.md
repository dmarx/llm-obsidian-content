### Expansion Fans

**Expansion fans** are phenomena in [[compressible fluid dynamics]] that occur when a supersonic flow undergoes a smooth and continuous expansion, typically around a convex corner or through a divergent passage. These fans consist of a series of infinitesimal expansion waves that spread out in a fan-like structure, allowing the flow to turn and expand isentropically (without any change in entropy). The most commonly studied expansion fan is the **Prandtl-Meyer expansion fan**, which occurs when a supersonic flow encounters a convex corner or sharp edge.

### Characteristics of Expansion Fans

1. **Isentropic Expansion**:
   - Expansion fans involve an isentropic process, meaning that the expansion occurs without any increase in entropy. This distinguishes them from [[shock waves]], which are characterized by an abrupt and irreversible increase in entropy.

2. **Increase in Mach Number**:
   - As the flow passes through the expansion fan, the Mach number increases. For example, if a supersonic flow enters an expansion fan with a Mach number \( M_1 \), it exits the fan with a higher Mach number \( M_2 \).

3. **Decrease in Pressure, Temperature, and Density**:
   - The expansion process causes a decrease in pressure, temperature, and density. This occurs smoothly and continuously as the flow passes through the fan.

4. **Fan of Expansion Waves**:
   - The expansion is not accomplished by a single wave but by a continuous fan of expansion waves. Each wave in the fan corresponds to a small increment in the flow turning angle and Mach number.

### Prandtl-Meyer Expansion Fan

The **Prandtl-Meyer expansion fan** is the most well-known type of expansion fan, typically observed in supersonic flows. It occurs when the flow turns around a convex corner, leading to a smooth expansion.

1. **Prandtl-Meyer Function**:
   - The Prandtl-Meyer function \( \nu(M) \) describes the relationship between the Mach number \( M \) of the flow and the angle \( \theta \) through which the flow turns:
     $$
     \nu(M) = \sqrt{\frac{\gamma + 1}{\gamma - 1}} \tan^{-1}\left(\sqrt{\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma + 1}(M^2 - 1)}\right) - \tan^{-1}\left(\sqrt{M^2 - 1}\right),
     $$
     where \( \gamma \) is the [[adiabatic index]] (ratio of specific heats).

2. **Flow Turning**:
   - When a supersonic flow encounters a convex corner, it turns by an angle \( \theta \). The change in Mach number is determined by the Prandtl-Meyer function:
     $$
     \theta = \nu(M_2) - \nu(M_1),
     $$
     where \( M_1 \) and \( M_2 \) are the Mach numbers before and after the expansion.

3. **Changes in Flow Properties**:
   - As the flow passes through the Prandtl-Meyer expansion fan:
     - The Mach number increases.
     - The pressure, temperature, and density decrease according to the isentropic relations.

### Mathematical Description of Expansion Fans

For an ideal gas undergoing an isentropic expansion, the following relationships describe the changes in flow properties through the expansion fan:

1. **Pressure Ratio**:
   $$
   \frac{p_2}{p_1} = \left(\frac{1 + \frac{\gamma - 1}{2} M_1^2}{1 + \frac{\gamma - 1}{2} M_2^2}\right)^{\frac{\gamma}{\gamma - 1}},
   $$

2. **Temperature Ratio**:
   $$
   \frac{T_2}{T_1} = \frac{1 + \frac{\gamma - 1}{2} M_1^2}{1 + \frac{\gamma - 1}{2} M_2^2},
   $$

3. **Density Ratio**:
   $$
   \frac{\rho_2}{\rho_1} = \left(\frac{p_2}{p_1}\right) \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right),
   $$

These equations allow engineers and scientists to predict how flow properties will change as the fluid passes through the expansion fan.

### Examples and Applications

1. **Supersonic Aircraft Design**:
   - Expansion fans are crucial in the design of supersonic aircraft and spacecraft, particularly in areas where the flow must turn smoothly around corners or over surfaces. Managing expansion fans effectively can reduce drag and thermal loads.

2. **Rocket Nozzles**:
   - Rocket nozzles are designed to take advantage of Prandtl-Meyer expansions to efficiently accelerate exhaust gases to supersonic speeds, maximizing thrust.

3. **Wind Tunnel Testing**:
   - Expansion fans are studied in supersonic wind tunnels to understand how different geometries affect the flow. This helps in validating theoretical predictions and optimizing aerodynamic designs.

4. **Supersonic Intakes**:
   - Inlet designs for supersonic aircraft often use controlled expansions to slow and compress incoming air before it enters the engine, optimizing the engine's performance.

### Visualization and Analysis

1. **Flow Visualization**:
   - Expansion fans can be visualized using techniques such as schlieren or shadowgraph photography, which capture the changes in density gradients as the flow expands. These images reveal the fan-like structure of the expansion.

2. **Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)**:
   - CFD simulations are widely used to model expansion fans, providing detailed insights into how flow properties change and how different designs affect performance.

### Conclusion

**Expansion fans**, particularly Prandtl-Meyer expansion fans, are fundamental phenomena in [[compressible fluid dynamics]], enabling supersonic flows to expand smoothly around corners or through divergent passages. They play a crucial role in the design and analysis of high-speed aerodynamic systems, such as supersonic aircraft, rockets, and wind tunnel models. Understanding and effectively managing expansion fans is essential for optimizing performance and ensuring the stability of high-speed flows in various engineering applications.
