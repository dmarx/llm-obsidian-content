# Competitive Authoritarianism

Competitive authoritarianism is a [[hybrid regime]] type that combines authoritarian practices with democratic institutions. Unlike full [[authoritarianism]], competitive authoritarian regimes maintain the formal democratic institutions but manipulate them to create an uneven playing field between incumbents and opposition.

## Definition and Conceptualization

Competitive authoritarianism was first systematically theorized by political scientists [[Steven Levitsky]] and [[Lucan Way]] (2002, 2010) to describe regimes that are neither fully democratic nor fully authoritarian. These regimes can be formally defined as civilian regimes in which:

1. Democratic institutions exist and are widely viewed as primary means of gaining power
2. Incumbents violate democratic rules so severely that the regime fails to meet minimal democratic standards
3. There exists real competition for power, albeit on an uneven playing field

Mathematically, we can formalize the competitive authoritarian "space" within a regime typology as:

$$R = \{r \in \text{Regimes} \mid D(r) > \delta \text{ and } A(r) > \alpha\}$$

Where:
- $D(r)$ represents the degree of democratic institutions in regime $r$
- $A(r)$ represents the degree of authoritarian practices in regime $r$
- $\delta$ and $\alpha$ are threshold values for democratic institutions and authoritarian practices respectively

## Distinguishing Features

The key features that distinguish competitive authoritarian regimes include:

### 1. Electoral Manipulation

While elections occur regularly, they are subject to various forms of manipulation represented by function $M$:

$$M(e) = \{m_1, m_2, ..., m_n\}$$

Where $e$ is an election and $m_i$ are manipulation tactics including:
- Biased electoral administration
- Voter list manipulation
- Disproportionate media access
- Abuse of state resources for campaigning
- Selective prosecution of opposition figures

### 2. Uneven Playing Field

The structural advantages enjoyed by incumbents can be modeled as:

$$U = \frac{R_i}{R_o}$$

Where:
- $U$ represents the unevenness of the playing field
- $R_i$ represents resources available to incumbents
- $R_o$ represents resources available to opposition

In competitive authoritarian regimes, $U \gg 1$, indicating a significant resource advantage for incumbents.

### 3. Limited but Real Competition

Despite manipulation, opposition forces retain meaningful opportunities to contest power, represented by probability $P(victory|opposition)$, which remains non-trivial:

$$0 < P(victory|opposition) < P(victory|incumbent) < 1$$

## Measurement and Typology

Competitive authoritarianism can be situated along several continuous dimensions:

1. **Electoral Competitiveness Index (ECI)**:
   $$ECI = \frac{V_o}{V_i} \cdot \frac{S_o}{S_i}$$
   Where $V$ represents votes and $S$ represents seats, with subscripts for incumbent ($i$) and opposition ($o$).

2. **Civil Liberties Score (CLS)**:
   $$CLS = \sum_{j=1}^{m} w_j \cdot L_j$$
   Where $L_j$ represents the level of protection for civil liberty $j$, and $w_j$ is the weight assigned to that liberty.

3. **Institutional Manipulation Index (IMI)**:
   $$IMI = \sum_{k=1}^{p} c_k \cdot I_k$$
   Where $I_k$ represents the level of manipulation of institution $k$, and $c_k$ is the coefficient of importance.

## Causal Mechanisms and Stability

The stability of competitive authoritarian regimes depends on several factors:

1. **Organizational Power** (OP):
   $$OP = \alpha \cdot SP + \beta \cdot CP + \gamma \cdot EP$$
   Where:
   - $SP$ is state penetration of society
   - $CP$ is cohesion of party organizations
   - $EP$ is economic patronage capability
   - $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ are weighting coefficients

2. **International Linkage** (IL):
   $$IL = \sum_{l=1}^{q} d_l \cdot L_l$$
   Where $L_l$ represents the level of linkage of type $l$ (economic, political, diplomatic, etc.), and $d_l$ is the coefficient for that linkage type.

## Trajectories and Transitions

Competitive authoritarian regimes exhibit three primary trajectory patterns:

1. **Democratization** - When $ECI$ increases and $IMI$ decreases over time:
   $$\frac{d(ECI)}{dt} > 0 \text{ and } \frac{d(IMI)}{dt} < 0$$

2. **Authoritarian Consolidation** - When $ECI$ decreases and $IMI$ increases over time:
   $$\frac{d(ECI)}{dt} < 0 \text{ and } \frac{d(IMI)}{dt} > 0$$

3. **Stable Competitive Authoritarianism** - When both metrics remain within bounded ranges:
   $$\Delta ECI \approx 0 \text{ and } \Delta IMI \approx 0$$

## Notable Examples

Historically significant cases of competitive authoritarian regimes include:

- Russia under [[Vladimir Putin]] (2000-present)
- Venezuela under [[Hugo Chávez]] and [[Nicolás Maduro]] (1999-present)
- Hungary under [[Viktor Orbán]] (2010-present)
- Turkey under [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] (2003-present)
- Malaysia under [[Barisan Nasional]] coalition (1957-2018)

## Theoretical Implications

Competitive authoritarianism challenges traditional democratization theories by suggesting that:

1. [[Democratic transition]] is not unidirectional
2. [[Hybrid regimes]] can be stable equilibria rather than transitional states
3. [[Formal institutions]] matter even in non-democratic contexts

## Methodological Considerations

When identifying and measuring competitive authoritarianism, researchers must address several challenges:

1. **Observational Equivalence Problem**: Distinguishing genuine democratic deficits from manipulation
2. **Endogeneity Issues**: Separating causes from consequences of regime type
3. **Conceptual Boundaries**: Determining thresholds that separate regime types

This can be modeled as a classification problem with fuzzy boundaries:

$$P(r \in \text{CA}) = f(\vec{x})$$

Where $\vec{x}$ is a vector of observable regime characteristics and $f$ is a function mapping these characteristics to the probability that regime $r$ is competitive authoritarian.

## Current Research Frontiers

Contemporary research on competitive authoritarianism focuses on:

1. Digital manipulation of electoral and civic spaces
2. Legitimation strategies beyond traditional electoral manipulation
3. The role of transnational authoritarian networks
4. The impact of economic uncertainty on regime stability
