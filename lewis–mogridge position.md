Lewis–Mogridge position


**ASSISTANT**

The **Lewis–Mogridge Position** (also known as the **Lewis–Mogridge Hypothesis**) is an observation in transportation planning and urban economics that states that increasing road capacity in urban areas typically leads to increased traffic congestion rather than reduced travel times. This phenomenon occurs because as road capacity expands, more people are incentivized to use the roads, ultimately leading to a return to the previous levels of congestion, or even worse congestion.

### Background and Explanation

The **Lewis–Mogridge Position** is named after two researchers:

- **David Lewis**, a British transportation planner who formulated the concept in 1969.
- **Martin Mogridge**, an economist and transportation researcher who expanded on the idea in his 1990 book *Travel in Towns*.

The hypothesis is closely related to other concepts in transportation economics, such as the [[Downs–Thomson paradox]] and the idea of **[[induced demand]]**, which explains how increasing the supply of a good (in this case, road space) can increase demand to match or exceed that supply.

#### Core Principles of the Lewis–Mogridge Position

1. **Induced Demand**: When road capacity increases, the immediate effect is to reduce congestion and travel times. However, the reduced travel time makes driving more attractive, which leads to a behavioral response where more people decide to drive. This response includes:
   - **Mode Switching**: Some commuters switch from public transportation, walking, or cycling to driving because the improved road conditions make driving more appealing.
   - **Route Changes**: Drivers might change their routes to take advantage of the increased capacity, which can draw additional traffic to the newly expanded road.
   - **Generated Trips**: The lowered cost (in terms of time) of driving may lead to additional trips that wouldn't have been made otherwise, or longer trips.

2. **Dynamic Equilibrium of Traffic Congestion**: Over time, the initial reduction in congestion and travel time is offset by the increase in the number of vehicles using the road. The system reaches a new equilibrium where congestion and travel times can return to their original levels or even worsen, due to the additional traffic that has been attracted.

3. **Impacts on Public Transportation**: If road capacity improvements lead to more people switching to driving, public transit may see reduced ridership. This can result in lower revenues and less frequent service, which can further decrease the attractiveness of public transportation and increase reliance on private vehicles.

### Mathematical Representation

To illustrate the **Lewis–Mogridge Position**, consider a simple model of traffic flow:

- **Road Capacity**: Let $C$ represent the capacity of a road in terms of the maximum number of vehicles per hour it can efficiently handle.
- **Travel Demand**: Let $D(T)$ represent the travel demand as a function of travel time $T$. Generally, as $T$ decreases, $D(T)$ increases (i.e., $D'(T) < 0$), reflecting that more people choose to drive when travel times are lower.

When road capacity $C$ is increased, the travel time $T(C, D)$ initially decreases because the same number of vehicles are spread over more capacity:

$$
\frac{\partial T}{\partial C} < 0 \quad \text{(initially)}.
$$

However, as travel time decreases, demand $D(T)$ increases, leading to more vehicles on the road:

$$
\frac{\partial D}{\partial T} < 0.
$$

The equilibrium travel time $T^*$ occurs when the traffic volume $V$ equals the road capacity $C$:

$$
V = D(T^*) = C.
$$

As $C$ increases, $T$ temporarily decreases, but the new equilibrium $T'^*$ can return to the original $T^*$ or worsen due to increased $D(T)$, where more drivers enter the network:

$$
T'^* \geq T^*.
$$

This results from increased demand offsetting the gains from increased capacity.

### Empirical Evidence and Studies

The **Lewis–Mogridge Position** has been supported by various empirical studies in different cities worldwide:

1. **London and Other Major Cities**: Research in London showed that whenever new roads or additional lanes were added, congestion levels often returned to or exceeded pre-expansion levels within a few years due to the influx of additional vehicles. Similar patterns have been observed in cities like Los Angeles and Paris.

2. **Elasticity of Traffic Demand**: Studies have shown that the elasticity of demand for road travel with respect to travel time is often high enough to offset any benefits from increased capacity. This means that any initial improvement in travel conditions is quickly nullified by additional drivers.

3. **Impact on Public Transit**: Reduced congestion temporarily may lure public transit users to switch to private cars, as seen in cities with poor public transportation investment, further reducing the effectiveness of the expanded road network.

### Implications for Urban Planning and Policy

The **Lewis–Mogridge Position** has significant implications for transportation planning and urban policy:

1. **Rethinking Road Expansion**: It challenges the traditional approach of expanding road networks as a primary solution to traffic congestion. Instead, it suggests that such expansions can be counterproductive in the long term.

2. **Investment in Public Transport**: The hypothesis supports investing in public transportation systems as a more sustainable solution to urban congestion. High-quality public transport can absorb more commuters, reduce car dependency, and help manage congestion more effectively.

3. **Demand Management Strategies**: The position advocates for demand management techniques, such as congestion pricing, carpooling incentives, and better land-use planning, to reduce the number of vehicles on the road rather than increasing road capacity.

4. **Integrated Urban Mobility**: The Lewis–Mogridge Position underscores the need for integrated approaches that balance road use with public transit, cycling, and pedestrian infrastructure to create more sustainable and efficient urban mobility systems.

### Conclusion

The **Lewis–Mogridge Position** reveals a fundamental paradox in urban traffic management: expanding road capacity often does not alleviate congestion in the long term due to [[induced demand]]. This highlights the need for a more nuanced approach to transportation planning that includes investing in public transit and implementing demand management strategies to achieve sustainable urban mobility and reduce congestion.
