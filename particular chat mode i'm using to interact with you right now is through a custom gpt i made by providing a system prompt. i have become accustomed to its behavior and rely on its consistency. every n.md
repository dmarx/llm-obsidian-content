Could you clarify what specifically you found unsatisfactory with the original response? Was it something about the explanation of the "Janusverse" itself, the depth or breadth of the information, or the sources cited? I'd like to understand your expectations so I can improve the response accordingly.


**USER**

the particular chat mode I'm using to interact with you right now is through a "Custom GPT" I "made" by providing a system prompt. I have become accustomed to its behavior and rely on its consistency. Every now and then I'll notice some consistent behavioral change in the outputs to indicate that the underlying model has changed. I understand this must happen to some extent, but it should be minimally visible to me as a user. My "custom GPT" is supposed to return outputs adhering to a format that is specified vaguely in the system prompt i engineered, but not so vaguely that it wasn't producing reasonably consistent results. this most recent response is glaringly out of distribution for the "custom GPT" I'm interacting with here. the invocation of external search was also a surprise, I'm fairly confident my custom GPT has never had the ability to use tools previously and I would have expected that would be something I would need to specifically enable. So it having enabled for me without my consent was an unwelcome surprise.


**ASSISTANT**

Thank you for clarifying, and I see the issue more clearly now. It sounds like you're aiming for a consistent output style based on the custom system prompt you set up, and the recent interaction—especially with the search feature—broke that consistency. The tool-enabled behavior was unexpected and not what you've experienced with this GPT before.

Could you let me know a bit more about the particular formatting or style your custom GPT typically follows, especially in contrast with my last response? I'd like to align my responses more closely to your preferred format and ensure future answers stay within that framework.
