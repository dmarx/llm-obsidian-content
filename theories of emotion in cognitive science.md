# Theories of Emotion in Cognitive Science

## Overview

Contemporary theories of emotion span multiple levels of analysis, from [[neurobiological substrates]] to [[computational models]] of [[affective processing]]. These frameworks provide distinct but complementary perspectives on the mechanisms underlying emotional experience and regulation.

## Interoceptive Theories

### Craig's Hierarchical Interoception Model

[[Interoceptive processing]] forms the foundation of emotional awareness through a hierarchical pathway from [[primary interoceptive cortex]] to [[metacognitive awareness]]. The model proposes:

**Formal Structure:**
- Let $I(t) = \{i_1(t), i_2(t), ..., i_n(t)\}$ represent the vector of interoceptive signals at time $t$
- [[Lamina I spinothalamic neurons]] encode $I(t) \rightarrow \hat{I}(t)$ where $\hat{I}(t)$ represents the neural encoding
- [[Posterior insular cortex]] performs integration: $\Psi(t) = f(\hat{I}(t), C(t))$ where $C(t)$ represents contextual information
- [[Anterior insular cortex]] generates [[subjective feeling states]]: $E(t) = g(\Psi(t), M(t))$ where $M(t)$ represents metacognitive processes

### Damasio's Somatic Marker Hypothesis

[[Somatic markers]] function as [[embodied decision-making]] signals through [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]] mediation.

**Mathematical Formalization:**
- Decision options: $D = \{d_1, d_2, ..., d_k\}$
- [[Somatic state space]]: $S = \{s_1, s_2, ..., s_j\}$
- Mapping function: $\phi: D \rightarrow S$ where $\phi(d_i)$ represents the somatic marker for decision $d_i$
- [[Valence assignment]]: $V: S \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ where positive values indicate approach and negative values indicate avoidance
- Decision probability: $P(d_i) \propto \exp(\beta \cdot V(\phi(d_i)))$ where $\beta$ represents the strength of somatic influence

## Appraisal Theories

### Lazarus's Cognitive-Motivational-Relational Theory

Emotions emerge from [[cognitive appraisals]] of person-environment relationships relative to individual goals and coping resources.

**Appraisal Dimensions:**
- [[Primary appraisal]]: $A_1 = \{relevance, congruence, ego\_involvement\}$
- [[Secondary appraisal]]: $A_2 = \{blame/credit, coping\_potential, future\_expectancy\}$

**Formal Model:**
Let $G$ represent goal states, $E$ environmental conditions, $R$ resources
- Relevance: $rel(E, G) = \max_i |correlation(E_i, G_i)|$
- Congruence: $cong(E, G) = \sum_i w_i \cdot sign(E_i - G_i)$ where $w_i$ represents goal importance
- [[Stress response]]: $stress = f(cong(E, G), coping\_potential(R, E))$

### Scherer's Component Process Model

[[Multicomponent emotion process]] involving [[sequential appraisal checks]] across multiple [[stimulus evaluation checks]]:

1. **Novelty Check**: $N(S) = |S(t) - \mathbb{E}[S]|$ where $S(t)$ is current stimulus and $\mathbb{E}[S]$ is expected stimulus
2. **Intrinsic Pleasantness**: $P(S) = \sum_i w_i \cdot p_i(S)$ where $p_i$ are pleasantness dimensions
3. **Goal Significance**: $G(S) = \max_j relevance(S, goal_j)$
4. **Coping Potential**: $C(S) = power(agent) \cdot controllability(S)$
5. **Norm Compatibility**: $Norm(S) = compatibility(S, social\_standards)$

## Constructed Emotion Theory

### Feldman Barrett's Psychological Construction

Emotions are [[constructed experiences]] rather than [[discrete neural circuits]], emerging from the interaction of [[core affect]] and [[conceptual knowledge]].

**Core Affect Space:**
- Two-dimensional space: $(valence, arousal) \in [-1,1] \times [0,1]$
- [[Affective workspace]]: $A(t) = (v(t), a(t))$ where $v(t)$ represents valence and $a(t)$ represents arousal
- [[Conceptual categorization]]: $Cat: A(t) \times Context(t) \rightarrow Emotion\_Categories$
- [[Predictive coding]] framework: $\hat{A}(t+1) = Predict(A(t), sensory\_input(t), prior\_knowledge)$

### Seth's Predictive Processing Framework

[[Interoceptive inference]] generates emotional experience through [[hierarchical predictive models]]:

**Prediction Error Minimization:**
- Sensory input: $s(t)$
- Prior beliefs: $p(\theta)$
- Likelihood: $p(s|\theta)$
- Posterior: $p(\theta|s) \propto p(s|\theta)p(\theta)$
- [[Precision weighting]]: $\tau^{-1}$ modulates prediction error influence
- [[Emotional salience]]: $Salience = \tau^{-1} \cdot |s(t) - \hat{s}(t)|$

## Basic Emotions Theory

### Panksepp's Affective Neuroscience

[[Primary emotional systems]] represent evolutionarily conserved [[subcortical circuits]]:

**Seven Primary Systems:**
1. **SEEKING**: $\mathbb{E}[reward] = \sum_i P(reward_i) \cdot V(reward_i)$
2. **FEAR**: $Fear\_activation = \sigma(threat\_detection - safety\_signals)$
3. **RAGE**: $Rage = f(frustration, resource\_competition)$
4. **LUST**: $Lust = g(hormonal\_state, social\_triggers)$
5. **CARE**: $Care = h(offspring\_signals, parental\_state)$
6. **PANIC/GRIEF**: $Grief = separation\_distress(attachment\_bonds)$
7. **PLAY**: $Play = exploratory\_drive \cdot social\_safety$

Where $\sigma$ represents sigmoid activation function.

## Rolls' Emotion and Motivation Framework

[[Reinforcement learning]] mechanisms underlie emotional responses through [[reward prediction error]] signaling:

**Reward Processing:**
- State space: $S$
- Action space: $A$  
- Reward function: $R: S \times A \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$
- Value function: $V(s) = \mathbb{E}[\sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t R(s_t, a_t) | s_0 = s]$
- [[Prediction error]]: $\delta_t = R(s_t, a_t) + \gamma V(s_{t+1}) - V(s_t)$
- [[Emotional valence]] correlates with $sign(\delta_t)$ and [[emotional intensity]] with $|\delta_t|$

## LeDoux's Higher-Order Theory

[[Conscious emotional experience]] requires [[higher-order cognitive processes]] that monitor and represent [[non-conscious emotional responses]]:

**Dual-System Architecture:**
- [[Survival circuits]]: $SC_i$ operate automatically for threat detection and response
- [[Higher-order thought]]: $HOT$ monitors and represents survival circuit activity
- [[Conscious emotion]]: $CE = HOT(SC_i, working\_memory, attention)$

**Information Integration:**
Let $\Phi$ represent [[integrated information]] measure:
- $\Phi(system) = \sum_{partitions} D(whole \parallel parts)$
- [[Emotional consciousness]] emerges when $\Phi(emotional\_network) > \Phi_{threshold}$

## Computational Integration

**Unified Framework:**
A comprehensive model might integrate these theories:

$$Emotion(t) = \int_{theories} w_i \cdot Theory_i(sensory(t), memory(t), goals(t), context(t))$$

Where integration weights $w_i$ reflect the relative contribution of each theoretical framework to the overall emotional state.

**Cross-Theory Mappings:**
- [[Interoceptive signals]] $\leftrightarrow$ [[Somatic markers]] $\leftrightarrow$ [[Core affect]]
- [[Appraisal processes]] $\leftrightarrow$ [[Predictive error]] $\leftrightarrow$ [[Higher-order monitoring]]
- [[Basic emotion circuits]] $\leftrightarrow$ [[Survival circuits]] $\leftrightarrow$ [[Primary emotional systems]]

## Research Implications

These theoretical frameworks suggest several computational approaches to [[artificial emotional intelligence]]:

1. **[[Hierarchical interoceptive processing]]** for [[embodied AI]]
2. **[[Multi-dimensional appraisal algorithms]]** for [[context-sensitive responses]]
3. **[[Predictive coding architectures]]** for [[adaptive emotional learning]]
4. **[[Reinforcement learning]]** with [[emotional value functions]]
5. **[[Integrated information approaches]]** to [[machine consciousness]]
