# Amortized Analysis

Amortized analysis is a mathematical technique for analyzing the average time complexity of algorithms across a sequence of operations, rather than focusing on the worst-case complexity of individual operations. This method provides tighter bounds for data structures and algorithms that occasionally perform expensive operations but have lower average costs across multiple operations.

## Mathematical Formalization

### Basic Framework

Amortized analysis assigns an amortized cost $\hat{c}_i$ to each operation $i$ such that:

$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} \hat{c}_i \geq \sum_{i=1}^{n} c_i$$

Where $c_i$ is the actual cost of operation $i$, ensuring that the total amortized cost is an upper bound on the total actual cost.

### Three Primary Methods

#### 1. Aggregate Analysis

The average cost across a sequence of $n$ operations:

$$\hat{c}_i = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} c_i$$

Where each operation is assigned the same amortized cost.

#### 2. Accounting Method (Banker's Method)

Each operation is assigned a specific amortized cost:

$$\hat{c}_i = c_i + \text{credit}_i$$

Where credits saved during cheap operations are spent during expensive ones, maintaining the invariant:

$$\sum_{i=1}^{j} \hat{c}_i \geq \sum_{i=1}^{j} c_i \text{ for all } j \in \{1, 2, ..., n\}$$

#### 3. Potential Method

Using a potential function $\Phi$ that maps data structure states to real numbers:

$$\hat{c}_i = c_i + \Phi(D_i) - \Phi(D_{i-1})$$

Where:
- $D_i$ is the data structure state after operation $i$
- $\Phi(D_i) - \Phi(D_{i-1})$ is the change in potential

The total amortized cost relates to actual cost:

$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} \hat{c}_i = \sum_{i=1}^{n} c_i + \Phi(D_n) - \Phi(D_0)$$

With $\Phi(D_0) = 0$ and $\Phi(D_n) \geq 0$, we maintain the invariant that amortized cost bounds actual cost.

## Theoretical Properties

### 1. Conservation of Work

The fundamental principle behind amortized analysis is that total work must be accounted for:

$$\text{Total Actual Work} = \text{Total Amortized Work} - \text{Final Potential} + \text{Initial Potential}$$

### 2. Choice of Potential Function

The effectiveness of the potential method depends critically on choosing an appropriate potential function that:
- Increases during cheap operations to save credits
- Decreases during expensive operations to use saved credits
- Is always non-negative (typically $\Phi(D_0) = 0$)

### 3. Amortized vs. Expected Analysis

Amortized analysis differs from [[expected analysis]] in that:
- Amortized: Guaranteed bounds for any sequence of operations
- Expected: Average-case bounds over random operation sequences

$$\text{Amortized: } \max_{\text{sequences } S} \frac{1}{|S|} \sum_{i \in S} c_i \quad \text{vs.} \quad \text{Expected: } \mathbb{E}_S\left[\frac{1}{|S|} \sum_{i \in S} c_i\right]$$

## Classic Applications

### 1. [[Dynamic Array Resizing]]

For a dynamic array that doubles in size when full:

- **Actual cost**: $O(n)$ for resizing, $O(1)$ for normal insert
- **Potential function**: $\Phi(D) = 2 \cdot \text{size} - \text{capacity}$
- **Amortized cost**: $O(1)$ per insertion

The formal analysis shows:

$$\hat{c}_{\text{insert}} = \begin{cases}
3 & \text{if no resizing needed} \\
n+3 - 2(n-1) = 5 & \text{if resizing is needed}
\end{cases}$$

### 2. [[Binary Counter]]

For a binary counter with $n$ bits:

- **Actual cost**: Between $1$ and $n$ bit flips per increment
- **Potential function**: $\Phi(D) = \text{number of 1-bits in counter}$
- **Amortized cost**: $O(1)$ per increment

The formal analysis gives:

$$\hat{c}_{\text{increment}} = \text{actual flips} + \text{new 1-bits} - \text{previous 1-bits} \leq 2$$

### 3. [[Splay Tree Operations]]

For [[splay tree]] operations:

- **Actual cost**: $O(\log n)$ to $O(n)$ per operation
- **Potential function**: $\Phi(D) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \log(\text{size of subtree rooted at node } i)$
- **Amortized cost**: $O(\log n)$ per operation

### 4. [[Union-Find Data Structure]]

Using path compression and union by rank:

- **Actual cost**: Nearly but not quite $O(1)$ per operation
- **Potential function**: Based on rank differences in the forest
- **Amortized cost**: $O(\alpha(n))$ per operation, where $\alpha$ is the inverse Ackermann function

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. [[Multi-Level Potential Functions]]

For hierarchical data structures:

$$\Phi(D) = \sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i \cdot \Phi_i(D)$$

Where each $\Phi_i$ captures the potential at different levels of the structure.

### 2. [[Telescoping Series Analysis]]

Simplifying potential differences across a sequence:

$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} (\Phi(D_i) - \Phi(D_{i-1})) = \Phi(D_n) - \Phi(D_0)$$

### 3. [[Credit Invariants]]

Establishing formal invariants in the accounting method:

$$\text{Credit}(D) \geq \text{Cost}(\text{most expensive operation on } D)$$

## Complexity Bounds Classification

Amortized analysis yields several types of bounds:

### 1. [[Constant Amortized Time]]

$$\hat{c}_i = O(1) \text{ while } \max_i c_i = \omega(1)$$

Examples: Dynamic array insertions, binary counter increments

### 2. [[Logarithmic Amortized Time]]

$$\hat{c}_i = O(\log n) \text{ while } \max_i c_i = \omega(\log n)$$

Examples: Splay tree operations, skew heap operations

### 3. [[Sub-Linear Amortized Time]]

$$\hat{c}_i = o(n) \text{ while } \max_i c_i = \Omega(n)$$

Examples: Certain graph algorithms with periodic restructuring

## Applications in Algorithm Design

### 1. [[Lazy Evaluation Strategies]]

Deferring expensive operations until absolutely necessary:

$$\text{Credit Accumulated} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (\hat{c}_i - c_i)$$

### 2. [[Incremental Algorithm Design]]

Building solutions piece by piece with occasionally more expensive reorganizations:

$$c_i = \begin{cases}
\text{small} & \text{for most operations} \\
\text{large} & \text{for occasional restructuring}
\end{cases}$$

### 3. [[Dynamic Optimality Conjecture]]

The hypothesis that splay trees are within a constant factor of optimal BST operations:

$$\text{Cost}(\text{Splay Tree}) \leq O(1) \cdot \text{Cost}(\text{Optimal Dynamic BST})$$

## Connection to Other Analysis Methods

### 1. [[Competitive Analysis]]

Similar to amortized analysis but comparing algorithm performance to an optimal offline algorithm:

$$\text{Competitive Ratio} = \frac{\text{Cost}(\text{Online Algorithm})}{\text{Cost}(\text{Optimal Offline Algorithm})}$$

### 2. [[Smoothed Analysis]]

Analyzing the expected performance of algorithms under small random perturbations:

$$\text{Smoothed Complexity} = \max_{x} \mathbb{E}_{\delta}[T(x + \delta)]$$

Where $\delta$ represents small random noise.

### 3. [[Parametrized Complexity]]

Analyzing algorithms based on parameters other than input size:

$$T(n, k) = f(k) \cdot n^{O(1)}$$

Where $k$ is a parameter of the problem.

## Research Frontiers

Current research directions in amortized analysis include:

### 1. [[Data Structure Dynamization]]

Converting static data structures to dynamic ones with provable amortized bounds.

### 2. [[Online Algorithm Competitiveness]]

Using amortized analysis to establish tighter competitive ratios for online algorithms.

### 3. [[Self-Adjusting Data Structures]]

Creating structures that reorganize based on access patterns to optimize amortized performance.

Amortized analysis remains a powerful tool in algorithm design and analysis, providing more realistic complexity bounds for algorithms and data structures that exhibit occasional expensive operations within an otherwise efficient sequence of operations.
