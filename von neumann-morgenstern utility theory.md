Von Neumann-Morgenstern Utility Theory

### Von Neumann-Morgenstern Utility Theory

Von Neumann-Morgenstern utility theory, developed by John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern in their 1944 book "Theory of Games and Economic Behavior," provides an axiomatic foundation for expected utility theory, which is used to analyze decision-making under uncertainty. The theory formalizes the concept of utility and introduces the notion of expected utility to represent and evaluate choices involving risk.

#### 1. **Axiomatic Foundation**

Von Neumann-Morgenstern utility theory is built on several key axioms that describe rational behavior. These axioms ensure that an individual's preferences over risky alternatives can be represented by a utility function.

1. **Completeness**: For any two outcomes \( x \) and \( y \), an individual can express a preference for one over the other or indicate indifference.
   $$ x \succ y \text{ or } y \succ x \text{ or } x \sim y $$

2. **Transitivity**: Preferences are consistent. If an individual prefers \( x \) over \( y \) and \( y \) over \( z \), then they must prefer \( x \) over \( z \).
   $$ x \succ y \text{ and } y \succ z \Rightarrow x \succ z $$

3. **Independence**: If an individual prefers \( x \) over \( y \), they should also prefer a lottery that gives \( x \) with some probability \( p \) and another outcome \( z \) with probability \( (1-p) \) to a lottery that gives \( y \) with the same probability \( p \) and \( z \) with probability \( (1-p) \).
   $$ x \succ y \Rightarrow px + (1-p)z \succ py + (1-p)z $$

4. **Continuity**: If \( x \succ y \succ z \), there exists a probability \( p \in (0, 1) \) such that the individual is indifferent between \( y \) and a lottery that gives \( x \) with probability \( p \) and \( z \) with probability \( (1-p) \).
   $$ \exists \; p \in (0, 1) \; \text{such that} \; y \sim px + (1-p)z $$

#### 2. **Utility Function and Expected Utility**

Given that an individual's preferences satisfy these axioms, there exists a utility function \( u \) such that the individual's preferences can be represented by the expected utility of different actions or lotteries. This utility function assigns numerical values to outcomes in a way that reflects the individual's preferences.

- **Utility Function**: A function \( u(x) \) that assigns a real number to each outcome \( x \), representing the individual's preference for that outcome.

  $$ u: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R} $$

- **Expected Utility**: For a lottery that offers outcomes \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) with probabilities \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n \), the expected utility \( EU \) is the weighted sum of the utilities of the outcomes, with the weights being the probabilities.

  $$ EU = \sum_{i=1}^n p_i u(x_i) $$

#### 3. **Risk Preferences**

Von Neumann-Morgenstern utility theory allows for the representation of different risk preferences through the shape of the utility function.

- **Risk-Averse**: An individual is risk-averse if they prefer a certain outcome to a gamble with the same expected value. The utility function of a risk-averse individual is concave.

  $$ u(\alpha x + (1-\alpha) y) > \alpha u(x) + (1-\alpha) u(y) $$

- **Risk-Neutral**: An individual is risk-neutral if they are indifferent between a certain outcome and a gamble with the same expected value. The utility function of a risk-neutral individual is linear.

  $$ u(\alpha x + (1-\alpha) y) = \alpha u(x) + (1-\alpha) u(y) $$

- **Risk-Seeking**: An individual is risk-seeking if they prefer a gamble with the same expected value to a certain outcome. The utility function of a risk-seeking individual is convex.

  $$ u(\alpha x + (1-\alpha) y) < \alpha u(x) + (1-\alpha) u(y) $$

#### 4. **Applications of Von Neumann-Morgenstern Utility Theory**

- **Economics**: Used to model consumer behavior, market dynamics, and decision-making under uncertainty.
  - **Example**: Analyzing consumer choices between different products based on their expected utilities.
- **Finance**: Applied in portfolio selection, risk management, and investment decisions.
  - **Example**: Investors choose portfolios that maximize their expected utility, balancing risk and return.
- **Game Theory**: Provides a foundation for analyzing strategic interactions where outcomes depend on the actions of multiple agents.
  - **Example**: Predicting the behavior of firms in an oligopoly setting.

#### 5. **Examples and Case Studies**

- **Portfolio Selection**:
  - **Problem**: An investor must choose how to allocate wealth among different assets.
  - **Alternatives**: Various combinations of stocks, bonds, and other investments.
  - **Evaluation**: Assessing the expected returns and risks (variances) of different portfolios.
  - **Decision**: Choosing the portfolio that maximizes expected utility, given the investor's risk preferences.

- **Insurance**:
  - **Problem**: An individual must decide whether to purchase insurance.
  - **Alternatives**: Buying insurance (paying a premium to avoid a potential large loss) or not buying insurance (risking a large loss).
  - **Evaluation**: Calculating the expected utility of each alternative, considering the probabilities of different loss scenarios.
  - **Decision**: Choosing the option with the highest expected utility.

#### 6. **Criticisms and Limitations**

- **Descriptive Validity**: While the theory provides a normative model of [[rational decision-making]], actual human behavior often deviates due to cognitive biases, emotions, and other psychological factors.
  - **Example**: Behavioral economics documents phenomena like loss aversion and overconfidence, which challenge the predictions of expected utility theory.
- **Interpersonal Comparisons**: The utility functions are individual-specific, making it difficult to compare utilities across different individuals for policy-making and welfare analysis.
  - **Example**: Determining the social welfare impact of a policy that benefits some individuals at the expense of others.
- **Cardinality**: The theory assumes cardinal utility, which requires that the numerical differences in utility values are meaningful and measurable. In practice, utility is often subjective and difficult to quantify accurately.
  - **Example**: Measuring the utility derived from non-monetary goods like leisure or happiness.

### Conclusion

Von Neumann-Morgenstern utility theory provides a robust framework for understanding and analyzing decision-making under uncertainty. By formalizing the concept of utility and introducing the expected utility principle, it offers a way to represent preferences and make rational choices in the presence of risk. Despite its limitations and criticisms, the theory remains a foundational tool in economics, finance, and decision theory, offering valuable insights into human behavior and strategic interactions. Understanding and applying this theory enhances our ability to make informed and rational decisions across various contexts.
