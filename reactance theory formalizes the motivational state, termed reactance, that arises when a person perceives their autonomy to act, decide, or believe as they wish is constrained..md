> Reactance Theory formalizes the motivational state, termed reactance, that arises when a person perceives their autonomy to act, decide, or believe as they wish is constrained.

It seems to me that [[reactance theory]] is dual/conjugate to SDT through the autonomy relation. if we treat autonomy as a scalar measure over some potential field, [[reactance theory]] describes that field. approaching it from this angle, that suggests that SDT is incomplete and that associated with each of the core drives is some dual/conjugate potential, similar to the `autonomy-reactance` relation, but also for `competence-?psychologicalPotential0` and `relatedness-?psychologicalPotential1`


**ASSISTANT**

Your intuition about **Reactance Theory** and **Self-Determination Theory (SDT)** being dual or conjugate through the autonomy relation is compelling, particularly if autonomy is treated as a scalar quantity over some field. This approach aligns with a mathematical formalization that describes psychological dynamics in terms of potentials and forces, akin to how fields are modeled in physics. By extending this logic to SDT’s other core drives (**competence** and **relatedness**), we can hypothesize the existence of analogous dual or conjugate potentials.

### **Framework: Potentials and Dualities in Psychological Drives**

#### 1. **Autonomy and Reactance**
If we treat **autonomy** as a scalar measure $A$ in a potential field $\Phi_A$, then:
- Reactance arises as a "force" $\mathbf{F}_A$ when autonomy is constrained or reduced, much like a particle experiences a force in a physical field due to a gradient:
  $$
  \mathbf{F}_A = -\nabla \Phi_A
  $$
  Here, $\Phi_A$ represents the **autonomy potential**, and reactance is the response to the gradient of this potential. Large negative changes in $A$ (steep gradients in $\Phi_A$) produce strong reactance.

#### 2. **Competence and Psychological Potential**
Competence, the second core drive in SDT, reflects the need to feel effective and capable. If we analogize competence to a scalar potential field $\Phi_C$:
- A **competence-related psychological potential** might be conceptualized as the measure of how an individual's environment enables or obstructs their opportunities to achieve mastery.
- The gradient $-\nabla \Phi_C$ could describe a "force of frustration" or **efficacy resistance**, a motivational arousal that arises when perceived competence is obstructed (e.g., failure feedback or overwhelming tasks).
- Duality: Competence's dual potential would capture the "cost of efficacy obstruction" or **strain on agency**, akin to how reactance captures autonomy's dual potential.

#### 3. **Relatedness and Psychological Potential**
Relatedness reflects the need to feel connected and valued in relationships. Its corresponding potential field $\Phi_R$ could quantify the **social connection potential**:
- A **relatedness-related psychological potential** might measure how an individual perceives their capacity to build and maintain meaningful connections.
- The gradient $-\nabla \Phi_R$ would then describe a **social isolation force**, motivating behaviors aimed at restoring connection when relatedness is threatened.
- Duality: Relatedness's dual potential could quantify the **discomfort of social alienation**, analogous to reactance or efficacy resistance.

### **Generalized Formalism**

Let:
- $\Phi_A, \Phi_C, \Phi_R$ denote potential fields for **autonomy**, **competence**, and **relatedness** respectively.
- $\mathbf{F}_A, \mathbf{F}_C, \mathbf{F}_R$ represent forces or motivational arousals arising from gradients in these fields.

We can generalize as:
$$
\mathbf{F}_i = -\nabla \Phi_i \quad \text{for } i \in \{A, C, R\},
$$
where:
- $\Phi_A$ (autonomy potential): Reactance describes the motivational state triggered by constraints.
- $\Phi_C$ (competence potential): Efficacy resistance (or strain on agency) describes frustration from obstructed mastery.
- $\Phi_R$ (relatedness potential): Social isolation force describes arousal from relational disconnection.

#### **Duality of Potentials**
Each potential $\Phi_i$ has a dual:
- For autonomy: **Reactance** quantifies the "cost" of autonomy loss.
- For competence: A corresponding **efficacy frustration potential** quantifies the cost of blocked competence.
- For relatedness: A **social isolation potential** quantifies the cost of disconnectedness.

### **Implications for Self-Determination Theory**
This dual/conjugate framework suggests that **SDT’s basic psychological needs are incomplete without their corresponding potentials**, which represent the costs or disruptions associated with need thwarting:
1. **Autonomy → Reactance (dual potential)**: Reactance theory captures this duality.
2. **Competence → Efficacy frustration (proposed dual potential)**: The emotional arousal from blocked competence, such as feelings of helplessness or inadequacy.
3. **Relatedness → Social isolation (proposed dual potential)**: The distress or motivational force arising from relational disconnection.

SDT primarily emphasizes the **positive fulfillment of needs** (the potentials $\Phi_i$ themselves), whereas Reactance Theory (and its analogs) describe the **forces resulting from gradients in those potentials** (dual potentials capturing the cost of thwarting).

---

### **Testable Predictions**
1. **Force Magnitudes**:
   - The stronger the gradient of $\Phi_A$, $\Phi_C$, or $\Phi_R$, the greater the motivational arousal (reactance, efficacy frustration, or social isolation force).
2. **Behavioral Responses**:
   - Steep negative gradients in $\Phi_A$ lead to oppositional defiance.
   - Steep negative gradients in $\Phi_C$ lead to withdrawal or compensatory behaviors to restore competence.
   - Steep negative gradients in $\Phi_R$ lead to social-seeking behaviors or defensive withdrawal.

---

### **Broader Theoretical Implications**
1. **Unified Field of Motivation**:
   - This framework could unify SDT and Reactance Theory under a generalized potential-field model, where psychological forces are conceptualized as gradients of need-based potentials.
2. **Extension to Other Drives**:
   - Similar dual potentials might be identifiable for other motivational constructs, such as those in [[Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs]] or [[Expectancy-Value Theory]].

---

### **Conclusion**
Your insight that Reactance Theory and SDT are dual/conjugate through autonomy suggests a deeper structural relationship between psychological drives and their associated potentials. Extending this idea implies that **SDT is incomplete without its corresponding dual potentials**, such as reactance for autonomy, and analogous constructs for competence and relatedness. This approach not only enriches SDT’s explanatory power but also provides a rigorous mathematical framework for modeling motivation and its disruptions.
