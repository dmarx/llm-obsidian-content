Branching skill trees

### Branching Skill Trees

**Branching skill trees** are a type of progression mechanic in games that allow players to choose different paths to develop their characters or abilities. This system provides flexibility and customization, enabling players to specialize in certain skills or strategies based on their preferences. Branching skill trees are common in role-playing games (RPGs), strategy games, and other genres where character development and strategic depth are important.

#### Key Components of Branching Skill Trees

1. **Nodes (Skills/Abilities)**: Each node represents a specific skill or ability that a player can unlock. Nodes can offer passive bonuses (e.g., increased damage) or active abilities (e.g., special attacks).

2. **Edges (Dependencies)**: Edges connect nodes and represent prerequisite relationships. To unlock a node, players must first unlock its prerequisite nodes.

3. **Branches**: The tree's branches represent different paths a player can take, allowing for specialization in various domains (e.g., offense, defense, magic).

4. **Skill Points**: Players earn skill points through leveling up, completing quests, or other achievements, which they spend to unlock nodes.

5. **Tiers**: Skill trees are often organized into tiers, with higher-tier skills requiring more prerequisites and offering more powerful abilities.

#### Benefits of Branching Skill Trees

1. **Customization**: Players can tailor their character’s abilities to fit their playstyle, creating a unique experience for each player.
2. **Strategic Depth**: The need to make choices about which skills to unlock adds a layer of strategy to the game.
3. **Replayability**: Different branches encourage multiple playthroughs, as players can explore new abilities and strategies each time.

#### Examples of Branching Skill Trees

1. **"The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim"**: Features a branching skill tree system where each skill (e.g., archery, smithing) has its own tree with various paths players can take to specialize their abilities.
2. **"Path of Exile"**: Uses a massive, branching skill tree called the Passive Skill Tree, offering extensive customization and allowing players to create highly specialized builds.
3. **"Diablo II"**: Each character class has three distinct skill trees, each focusing on a different aspect of that class's abilities (e.g., the Barbarian’s Combat Skills, Combat Masteries, and Warcries).

#### Mathematical Formalization of Branching Skill Trees

To design and analyze branching skill trees, we can use graph theory and optimization techniques. A branching skill tree can be represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), where nodes represent skills and edges represent dependencies.

1. **Graph Representation**: The skill tree \( T \) is defined as:

$$
T = (V, E)
$$

where \( V \) is the set of nodes (skills) and \( E \) is the set of edges (dependencies).

2. **Prerequisite Sets**: Each skill \( S_i \) has a prerequisite set \( P(S_i) \) of skills that must be unlocked before \( S_i \) can be accessed:

$$
P(S_i) \subseteq V
$$

3. **Cost Functions**: The cost of unlocking a skill \( S_i \) is defined by a function \( C: V \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \):

$$
C(S_i) = k_i
$$

where \( k_i \) is the cost in skill points to unlock \( S_i \).

4. **Utility Functions**: The benefit or utility of a skill \( S_i \) is defined by a function \( U: V \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \):

$$
U(S_i) = u_i
$$

where \( u_i \) represents the value or effectiveness of \( S_i \).

5. **Optimization**: Players aim to maximize their total utility given a limited number of skill points. This can be formulated as an optimization problem:

$$
\max \sum_{S_i \in V} U(S_i) \quad \text{subject to} \quad \sum_{S_i \in V} C(S_i) \leq P
$$

where \( P \) is the total number of skill points available.

#### Example: Formalizing a Simple Branching Skill Tree

Consider a branching skill tree with the following structure:

- **Tier 1**: Skill A
- **Tier 2**: Skills B and C, which both require Skill A
- **Tier 3**: Skills D and E, where D requires Skill B and E requires Skill C

The skill tree can be represented as a graph:

$$
V = \{A, B, C, D, E\}
$$

$$
E = \{(A, B), (A, C), (B, D), (C, E)\}
$$

The prerequisite sets are:

$$
P(B) = \{A\}, \quad P(C) = \{A\}
$$
$$
P(D) = \{B\}, \quad P(E) = \{C\}
$$

Assume the costs and utilities of the skills are:

$$
C(A) = 1, \quad U(A) = 2
$$
$$
C(B) = 2, \quad U(B) = 3
$$
$$
C(C) = 2, \quad U(C) = 3
$$
$$
C(D) = 3, \quad U(D) = 5
$$
$$
C(E) = 3, \quad U(E) = 5
$$

If a player has 6 skill points, they can maximize their utility by unlocking a combination of skills within their point limit:

$$
\max \sum_{S_i \in \{A, B, C, D, E\}} U(S_i) \quad \text{subject to} \quad \sum_{S_i \in \{A, B, C, D, E\}} C(S_i) \leq 6
$$

Possible optimal paths:
- Unlocking Skills A, B, and D gives a total utility of \( U(A) + U(B) + U(D) = 2 + 3 + 5 = 10 \) with a total cost of \( C(A) + C(B) + C(D) = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 \).
- Unlocking Skills A, C, and E gives the same total utility of \( 10 \) and cost of \( 6 \).

#### Conclusion

Branching skill trees provide a flexible and customizable progression system that enhances player engagement and strategic depth. By mathematically formalizing these systems, game designers can ensure balanced and rewarding progression paths, offering players meaningful choices and a sense of growth. This approach allows for the creation of diverse and engaging gameplay experiences tailored to different playstyles and preferences.
