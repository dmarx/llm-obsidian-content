### Triple Point

The **triple point** of a substance is the unique set of conditions (temperature and pressure) at which three phases (solid, liquid, and gas) of that substance coexist in thermodynamic equilibrium. For water, the triple point is particularly significant because it serves as a fundamental reference point in thermodynamics and metrology.

#### Definition and Conditions

For water, the triple point occurs at a temperature of \( 273.16 \, \text{K} \) (0.01Â°C) and a pressure of \( 611.657 \, \text{Pa} \) (approximately 6.11 hPa). At this specific point, ice, liquid water, and water vapor can all exist simultaneously in equilibrium.

#### Thermodynamic Explanation

The concept of the triple point can be explained using the principles of thermodynamics and phase diagrams. The phase diagram of water shows the boundaries between the solid, liquid, and vapor phases. The triple point is where these boundaries intersect.

##### Gibbs Phase Rule

The Gibbs phase rule for a single-component system is given by:

$$
F = C - P + 2
$$

where:
- \( F \) is the number of degrees of freedom (independent variables like temperature and pressure that can be changed without altering the number of phases in equilibrium),
- \( C \) is the number of components (for pure water, \( C = 1 \)),
- \( P \) is the number of phases.

At the triple point, \( P = 3 \) (solid, liquid, and gas), so:

$$
F = 1 - 3 + 2 = 0
$$

This implies that the triple point is a unique condition with no degrees of freedom; the temperature and pressure are
