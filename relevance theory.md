### Relevance Theory

Relevance Theory, developed by [[Dan Sperber]] and [[Deirdre Wilson]], is a cognitive approach to [[pragmatics]] that builds on and extends Grice's theory of implicature. It focuses on how individuals communicate by making their utterances as relevant as possible to their audience. This theory posits that human cognition is geared towards the maximization of relevance, and it provides a framework for understanding how people infer meanings beyond the literal content of utterances.

#### Core Principles of Relevance Theory

1. **Cognitive Principle of Relevance**
   - **Definition**: Human cognition tends to be geared towards the maximization of relevance.
   - **Implication**: People pay attention to information that seems most relevant to them, processing it in a way that maximizes cognitive benefits while minimizing effort.

2. **Communicative Principle of Relevance**
   - **Definition**: Every act of ostensive communication communicates a presumption of its own optimal relevance.
   - **Implication**: When someone communicates, they signal that their message is worth the listener’s attention and effort to process, providing enough relevant information without unnecessary complexity.

#### Relevance and Communication

Relevance Theory asserts that in communication, speakers provide evidence of their intention to convey a message, and listeners interpret this evidence by seeking the most relevant meaning. This process involves the following steps:

1. **Ostensive-Inferential Communication**
   - **Ostensive Communication**: The act of making one's intention to communicate manifest. This involves using signals (e.g., gestures, tone, words) that indicate to the listener that a communicative act is taking place.
   - **Inferential Communication**: The process by which the listener infers the speaker’s meaning based on the provided evidence and contextual information.

2. **Context and Relevance**
   - **Context**: In Relevance Theory, context is a set of assumptions and background knowledge that the listener uses to interpret the speaker’s utterance. It is dynamically constructed and can change with new information.
   - **Relevance**: An utterance is relevant if it has positive cognitive effects, such as providing new information, confirming existing beliefs, or correcting misunderstandings, with minimal processing effort.

#### Optimal Relevance

For communication to be successful, the utterance must achieve optimal relevance, meaning it provides sufficient cognitive benefits to justify the processing effort required. This involves balancing two factors:

1. **Cognitive Effects**
   - **Definition**: The positive impacts on the listener’s mental state, such as learning new facts, strengthening existing beliefs, or resolving uncertainties.
   - **Examples**: 
     - Learning that "The train leaves at 5 PM" helps the listener plan their schedule.
     - Being reminded that "You have a meeting at 3 PM" reinforces an existing plan.

2. **Processing Effort**
   - **Definition**: The mental resources required to interpret the utterance, including attention, memory, and inferential reasoning.
   - **Examples**: 
     - A simple statement like "The meeting is at 3 PM" requires less effort to process than a complex sentence with multiple clauses and ambiguous references.

#### Applications of Relevance Theory

1. **Metaphor and Irony**
   - **Metaphor**: Interpreting metaphors involves finding a relevant similarity between the literal and intended meanings. For instance, "Juliet is the sun" implies qualities like warmth and brightness, which are contextually relevant to Juliet.
   - **Irony**: Interpreting irony involves recognizing that the speaker’s intended meaning is opposite to the literal meaning. For example, saying "Great job!" after a clear mistake conveys sarcasm and criticism through relevance.

2. **Indirect Speech Acts**
   - **Definition**: Indirect speech acts occur when the literal meaning differs from the intended meaning. Relevance Theory explains how listeners use context and inferential reasoning to derive the intended meaning.
   - **Example**: The question "Can you pass the salt?" is typically understood as a request rather than a literal inquiry about ability, because this interpretation is more relevant in the given context.

3. **Ambiguity Resolution**
   - **Definition**: Ambiguities arise when an utterance can be interpreted in multiple ways. Relevance Theory suggests that listeners choose the interpretation that maximizes relevance based on context.
   - **Example**: "He saw her duck" can mean either observing a person’s action of ducking or seeing a bird. The context (e.g., discussing a bird-watching trip) helps determine the most relevant interpretation.

#### Formal Representation

To model relevance formally, one can use a combination of context $C$, cognitive effects $E$, and processing effort $P$. The goal is to maximize relevance $R$:

$$
R = \frac{E}{P}
$$

An utterance $U$ in context $C$ is optimally relevant if it maximizes $R$. The listener evaluates $U$ by considering:

- The expected cognitive effects $E$.
- The required processing effort $P$.

#### Example Analysis

**Utterance**: "The boss is coming."

- **Context**: The listener is in an office environment with colleagues.
- **Cognitive Effects**: Alerts the listener to behave appropriately, possibly prepare for interaction.
- **Processing Effort**: Minimal, as the phrase is straightforward and contextually clear.

**Interpretation**: The utterance is highly relevant because it provides valuable information with little processing effort.

### Conclusion

Relevance Theory offers a comprehensive framework for understanding how people communicate and interpret meaning. By focusing on the principles of relevance and the interplay between cognitive effects and processing effort, it provides a robust explanation for various pragmatic phenomena, including implicature, metaphor, and irony. This theory underscores the importance of context and inferential reasoning in human communication, highlighting how speakers and listeners collaborate to achieve meaningful and efficient exchanges.
