**ASSISTANT**

**Peace Studies** is an interdisciplinary field that explores the causes of conflict and violence, as well as the methods for resolving conflicts and promoting peace. The field integrates insights from political science, sociology, history, psychology, law, and international relations to understand and address issues related to peace, conflict, justice, and human rights. Peace Studies aims to develop theoretical and practical approaches to achieve and sustain peace at local, national, and global levels.

## Key Aspects of Peace Studies
