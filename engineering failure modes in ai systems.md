# Engineering Failure Modes in AI Systems

[[Engineering failure modes]] represent systematic ways in which artificial intelligence systems can fail during development, deployment, or operation. These failures often emerge from fundamental misalignments between theoretical assumptions and practical implementations.

## Mathematical Formalization

Let's define an AI system S as a tuple:
S = (M, D, O, E)
where:
- M: Model architecture/parameters
- D: Training/validation data distribution
- O: Optimization procedure
- E: Execution environment

We can characterize failure modes F as mappings:
F: S → {0,1}ⁿ
where n represents distinct failure categories.

## Common Categories

### Distribution Shift
When the deployment distribution P_deploy differs significantly from training distribution P_train:
```
D_KL(P_deploy || P_train) > ε
```
where D_KL represents the [[Kullback-Leibler divergence]] and ε is a problem-specific threshold.

### Optimization Instability 
When the [[loss landscape]] contains pathological geometries:
- [[Vanishing gradients]]: ||∇L|| → 0
- [[Exploding gradients]]: ||∇L|| → ∞ 
- [[Saddle points]]: λ_min(H) ≈ 0 where H is the Hessian

### Resource Exhaustion
When computational demands exceed available resources:
- Memory: M_required > M_available
- Compute: C_required > C_available
- Time: T_execution > T_deadline

### Feedback Loop Failures
When system outputs affect future inputs creating [[unwanted attractors]]:
```
x_{t+1} = f(x_t) + η_t
```
where η_t represents environmental noise and f is the system function.

## Detection & Mitigation

### Monitoring Functions
Define monitoring function m_i for each failure mode:
```
m_i: S × T → ℝ
```
where T represents system telemetry.

### Intervention Policies
For each monitor m_i and threshold θ_i:
```
π_i(s,t) = {
  intervene if m_i(s,t) > θ_i
  continue otherwise
}
```

### Recovery Mechanisms
Recovery function r maps failed states to recovered states:
```
r: S_failed → S_recovered
```
subject to safety constraints C:
```
∀s ∈ S_failed: C(r(s)) = true
```

## Key Considerations

- [[Graceful degradation]]: Systems should fail predictably and safely
- [[Fault isolation]]: Failures should be contained to minimize cascade effects
- [[Recovery procedures]]: Clear protocols for system restoration
- [[Monitoring infrastructure]]: Continuous evaluation of system health
- [[Testing frameworks]]: Systematic verification of failure handling

The study of engineering failure modes intersects with [[reliability engineering]], [[systems theory]], and [[control theory]]. Understanding and managing these failure modes is crucial for building robust and reliable AI systems.
