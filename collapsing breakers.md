Collapsing Breakers

### Collapsing Breakers

**Collapsing breakers** are a type of ocean wave that represents an intermediate form between plunging breakers and surging breakers. They occur when the crest of the wave starts to break, but rather than fully forming a plunging curl or spilling forward gently, the crest collapses, and the wave base surges forward. This type of wave is common on moderately steep shorelines and plays a significant role in coastal dynamics, sediment transport, and wave energy dissipation.

### Characteristics of Collapsing Breakers

1. **Wave Structure**:
   - **Crest Collapse**: In collapsing breakers, the crest of the wave destabilizes and collapses downward, but without the formation of a fully developed plunging tube or barrel. Instead, the crest disintegrates into turbulence.
   - **Base Surge**: Unlike plunging breakers, where the energy is released in a forward curl, collapsing breakers have a base that continues to surge forward along the beach or shoreline. This results in a more abrupt energy dissipation.

2. **Wave Energy Dissipation**:
   - **Abrupt Energy Release**: Collapsing breakers dissipate energy more abruptly than spilling breakers but less violently than plunging breakers. The energy is released primarily through the collapse of the crest and the forward surge of the wave base.
   - **Turbulence Generation**: The collapse of the crest generates significant turbulence, which can contribute to mixing in the surf zone and impact sediment transport along the shoreline.

3. **Wave Height and Steepness**:
   - **Moderate Steepness**: Collapsing breakers generally occur when waves have moderate steepness. The waves are neither as steep as those that produce plunging breakers nor as gentle as those leading to spilling breakers.
   - **Influence of Slope**: The slope of the seabed or beach is a critical factor in determining wave type. Collapsing breakers are often found on moderately steep slopes, where the wave is forced to break but does not have enough steepness or energy to produce a plunging motion.

4. **Breaking Point**:
   - **Nearshore Occurrence**: Collapsing breakers typically form closer to the shore than plunging breakers but may still break some distance from the beach, depending on the underwater topography and wave conditions.
   - **Variable Behavior**: The exact point at which a wave becomes a collapsing breaker can vary depending on the wave's energy, the seabed slope, and other environmental factors such as wind and tides.

### Formation of Collapsing Breakers

1. **Seafloor Topography**:
   - **Moderate Slopes**: Collapsing breakers are most common on beaches with moderate slopes, where the water depth decreases steadily but not too abruptly. The wave energy is sufficient to cause the crest to collapse, but not to fully plunge.
   - **Underwater Features**: The presence of sandbars, ridges, or other underwater features can influence where and how collapsing breakers form. These features can modify the wave shape and the point at which it breaks.

2. **Wave Energy and Period**:
   - **Intermediate Energy Levels**: Collapsing breakers often result from waves with intermediate energy levels, where the wave has enough force to start breaking but lacks the full energy needed for a plunging break.
   - **Wave Period Influence**: Waves with shorter periods tend to be more prone to collapsing breaking because they do not have the time to develop into fully plunging waves. Longer-period waves are more likely to produce plunging breakers.

3. **Wind Conditions**:
   - **Onshore Winds**: Winds blowing toward the shore can enhance wave steepness, making collapsing breakers more likely. The added wind energy pushes the wave crest over, causing it to collapse.
   - **Offshore Winds**: Winds blowing away from the shore can flatten waves, sometimes preventing them from collapsing and leading to spilling breakers instead.

4. **Tidal Effects**:
   - **Tidal Influence**: Tides affect the water depth near the shore, influencing where and how waves break. During low tide, collapsing breakers may form further offshore, while at high tide, they may occur closer to the beach.

### Impacts of Collapsing Breakers

1. **Coastal Erosion and Sediment Transport**:
   - **Erosion Potential**: Collapsing breakers can contribute to coastal erosion by exerting strong forces on the beach as the wave energy is abruptly dissipated. This can lead to the removal of sand and other sediments from the beach.
   - **Sediment Redistribution**: The turbulence generated by collapsing breakers can stir up sediments and redistribute them along the shore, affecting beach morphology and the formation of features such as sandbars and dunes.

2. **Safety and Navigation**:
   - **Hazard to Swimmers**: Collapsing breakers can pose a hazard to swimmers, especially due to the strong surging motion and turbulence in the surf zone. These waves can create strong currents that can pull swimmers off balance.
   - **Impact on Small Vessels**: For small vessels near the shore, collapsing breakers can be dangerous, as the sudden energy release and wave surge can cause instability or capsize.

3. **Wave Energy Dissipation**:
   - **Impact on Coastal Structures**: Collapsing breakers exert significant forces on coastal structures such as seawalls, piers, and breakwaters. Engineers must account for the impact of these waves when designing and maintaining coastal infrastructure.
   - **Energy Transformation**: The process of wave breaking transforms wave energy into turbulence and heat, contributing to the overall energy balance in the coastal zone.

4. **Surfing**:
   - **Surfing Conditions**: Collapsing breakers are generally less desirable for surfing compared to plunging breakers, as they do not form the well-defined barrels that surfers seek. However, they can still provide surfable waves, especially for intermediate-level surfers.

### Observation and Prediction of Collapsing Breakers

1. **Field Observations**:
   - **Visual Monitoring**: Coastal scientists and engineers often monitor wave breaking patterns visually to assess beach erosion risks and sediment transport processes. Understanding the conditions that lead to collapsing breakers helps in predicting their impact.
   - **Wave Gauges and Buoys**: Instruments such as wave gauges and buoys can measure wave height, period, and speed, providing data that can be used to predict when and where collapsing breakers are likely to occur.

2. **Numerical Modeling**:
   - **Wave Models**: Numerical models simulate wave behavior, including breaking patterns, based on inputs such as wind speed, wave height, period, and bathymetry. These models help predict the occurrence and impact of collapsing breakers on different coastal areas.
   - **Coastal Management**: By integrating wave models with coastal management strategies, engineers and planners can better protect coastlines from the effects of wave breaking, including collapsing breakers.

3. **Remote Sensing**:
   - **Aerial and Satellite Imaging**: Remote sensing technologies, including drones, satellites, and fixed cameras, can capture images and data on wave patterns along coastlines. These observations help in identifying areas prone to collapsing breakers and assessing their impact on the shore.

### Conclusion

**Collapsing breakers** are a unique type of wave breaking that occurs when the wave crest collapses but the base of the wave surges forward. These waves typically form on moderately steep slopes and have significant implications for coastal erosion, sediment transport, and wave energy dissipation. Understanding the conditions that lead to collapsing breakers and their effects on coastal environments is essential for managing coastal areas, ensuring safety, and protecting infrastructure. Through a combination of field observations, numerical modeling, and remote sensing, scientists and engineers continue to improve their ability to predict and mitigate the impacts of collapsing breakers on coastlines.
