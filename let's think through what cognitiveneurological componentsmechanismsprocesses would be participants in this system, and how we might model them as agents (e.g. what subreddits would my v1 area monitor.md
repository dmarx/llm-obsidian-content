**USER**

let's think through what cognitive/neurological components/mechanisms/processes would be participants in this system, and how we might model them as agents (e.g. what subreddits would my v1 area monitor and/or post to)?


**ASSISTANT**

To build a more realistic cognitive system using the **/r/me** framework, we need to map specific **cognitive, neurological components, mechanisms, and processes** to subreddits and agents. These agents will represent different brain regions or functional modules, which monitor, post to, and moderate the various subreddits. The goal is to reflect how information flows and is processed in the brain, using a **publish-subscribe model**.

In a cognitive system modeled after human neurological processes, each brain region would have specific roles (e.g., sensory input processing, decision-making, memory encoding, etc.). Each **neural agent** (e.g., visual cortex, prefrontal cortex) would subscribe to the appropriate subreddits (e.g., visual processing, motor control), post information (e.g., sensory data or decision commands), and interact with other agents by monitoring and coordinating through shared subreddits.

### **Key Cognitive/Neurological Components and their Functions**

Here’s a breakdown of the major components that would participate in the **/r/me** system, their neurological counterparts, and what subreddits they would post to or moderate.

### **1. Sensory Processing Areas**
These regions are responsible for converting raw sensory inputs into neural signals that can be processed by higher cognitive functions. Each sensory processing region would have its own dedicated subreddit to represent that specific modality.

#### **Visual Cortex (V1)**
- **Role**: Processes raw visual input (e.g., light, shape, color) from the environment.
- **Subreddit**: **/r/visual_input**.
  - **Posts**: Raw visual information (e.g., “Red object detected in the upper-left visual field”).
  - **Monitors**: This agent monitors **/r/all** for visual input stimuli.
  - **Posts to**: It sends processed visual data to **/r/visuospatial_sketchpad** for spatial reasoning and **/r/mods** if global attention is needed (e.g., a sudden movement or danger in the visual field).

#### **Auditory Cortex**
- **Role**: Processes sound (pitch, volume, location) and transforms it into usable auditory signals.
- **Subreddit**: **/r/auditory_input**.
  - **Posts**: Information about sound, such as “High-pitched tone from the right” or “Human voice detected.”
  - **Monitors**: It subscribes to **/r/all** for auditory stimuli.
  - **Posts to**: **/r/phonological_loop** (if language-related) or **/r/mods** (if it’s urgent, like a loud unexpected sound).

#### **Somatosensory Cortex**
- **Role**: Processes tactile information (touch, temperature, pain) and provides the body map.
- **Subreddit**: **/r/tactile_input**.
  - **Posts**: Information about touch and body sensations (e.g., “Cold surface detected on right hand”).
  - **Monitors**: Subscribed to **/r/all** for touch-related stimuli.
  - **Posts to**: **/r/mods** if the sensation is important (e.g., pain), or directly to **/r/action** if it requires an immediate response (e.g., pull hand away from hot surface).

---

### **2. Working Memory Systems**
These components manage **short-term memory** and **active processing** of verbal, spatial, and multi-modal information. Each system is a key agent in cognitive functions like problem-solving and decision-making.

#### **Phonological Loop**
- **Role**: Temporarily stores and rehearses verbal and auditory information.
- **Subreddit**: **/r/phonological_loop**.
  - **Posts**: Repeated instructions or verbal content, such as “Repeat ‘turn left at the store’”.
  - **Monitors**: Subscribes to **/r/auditory_input** and **/r/memory** for relevant verbal content.
  - **Posts to**: **/r/mods** if the information requires executive attention (e.g., remembering critical instructions).

#### **Visuospatial Sketchpad**
- **Role**: Stores and processes spatial layouts and visual images in working memory.
- **Subreddit**: **/r/visuospatial_sketchpad**.
  - **Posts**: Visual information, such as “Visualizing the path to the grocery store.”
  - **Monitors**: Subscribes to **/r/visual_input** for visual information and **/r/memory** for previously stored images or maps.
  - **Posts to**: **/r/mods** if it needs executive attention or must be integrated with other information (e.g., in **/r/episodic_buffer**).

#### **Episodic Buffer**
- **Role**: Integrates multi-modal information (e.g., combining verbal and visual data) and forms a coherent episode.
- **Subreddit**: **/r/episodic_buffer**.
  - **Posts**: Integrated content, such as “Recalling the verbal directions and combining them with the visual route.”
  - **Monitors**: Subscribes to both **/r/phonological_loop** and **/r/visuospatial_sketchpad** for integrated processing.
  - **Posts to**: **/r/memory** for long-term storage or **/r/mods** for executive control and action coordination.

### **3. Executive and Decision-Making Systems**
These systems oversee and control the cognitive processes happening in the subreddits, making sure relevant information is attended to and decisions are made based on priorities.

#### **Prefrontal Cortex (Central Executive)**
- **Role**: Directs attention, oversees task management, and coordinates actions between subreddits.
- **Subreddit**: **/r/mods**.
  - **Posts**: Executive commands like “Prioritize verbal processing for instructions” or “Shift attention to visual input due to sudden movement.”
  - **Monitors**: Subscribes to **/r/phonological_loop**, **/r/visuospatial_sketchpad**, and **/r/episodic_buffer** to monitor ongoing tasks, as well as **/r/all** for new stimuli.
  - **Posts to**: **/r/action** if a decision is made (e.g., moving in a certain direction), or **/r/memory** if information needs to be remembered.

---

### **4. Long-Term Memory Systems**
These systems store information for future recall and serve as the system’s **knowledge base**.

#### **Hippocampus (Memory Encoding and Retrieval)**
- **Role**: Encodes information into long-term memory and retrieves it when necessary.
- **Subreddit**: **/r/memory**.
  - **Posts**: Stored memories or knowledge (e.g., “Remembering the layout of the store from last visit”).
  - **Monitors**: Subscribes to **/r/episodic_buffer**, **/r/phonological_loop**, and **/r/visuospatial_sketchpad** to receive content for long-term storage.
  - **Posts to**: **/r/phonological_loop** or **/r/visuospatial_sketchpad** when information is recalled, and **/r/mods** for retrieval tasks (e.g., recalling important facts when making a decision).

---

### **5. Action and Motor Systems**
These components translate cognitive outputs into physical actions or verbal responses.

#### **Motor Cortex**
- **Role**: Executes motor commands, such as moving limbs or navigating the environment.
- **Subreddit**: **/r/action**.
  - **Posts**: Motor commands (e.g., “Move left arm” or “Take two steps forward”).
  - **Monitors**: Subscribes to **/r/mods** for executive control and **/r/visuospatial_sketchpad** for spatial guidance.
  - **Posts to**: External systems (i.e., outputs to actual motor control in a real agent or virtual environment).

### **6. Emotional and Reward Systems**
These regions help guide behavior based on emotional responses and reward signals.

#### **Amygdala (Emotional Processing)**
- **Role**: Processes emotions such as fear, anger, or pleasure, and influences decision-making.
- **Subreddit**: **/r/emotion**.
  - **Posts**: Emotional evaluations (e.g., “Fear detected” or “Reward expected”).
  - **Monitors**: Subscribes to **/r/all** for emotional stimuli and **/r/mods** for emotional responses to decisions.
  - **Posts to**: **/r/mods** to influence decisions or **/r/memory** for emotionally charged memories.

### **Interaction Between Agents (Subreddits)**

Here’s how these subreddits would interact in a simple task, such as walking down the street while navigating to a store:

1. **/r/all** is continuously posting sensory input (visual, auditory, tactile data).
   - The **visual cortex** (subscribed to **/r/all**) detects a moving car and posts “Car moving towards the left” to **/r/visual_input**.
   - The **auditory cortex** (also subscribed to **/r/all**) detects a honking horn and posts “Loud horn from left” to **/r/auditory_input**.

2. The **visuospatial sketchpad** subscribes to **/r/visual_input** and receives the car’s position. It posts the processed data (“Car on left”) to **/r/visuospatial_sketchpad**.

3. The **phonological loop** is maintaining instructions
