## Fisherian vs Neyman-Pearson Frameworks

### Introduction

The Fisherian and Neyman-Pearson frameworks represent two fundamental approaches to hypothesis testing in statistics. Both methodologies have significantly influenced the development of statistical theory and practice, yet they differ in their underlying philosophies, objectives, and procedures. Understanding these differences is crucial for proper application and interpretation of statistical tests.

### Fisherian Framework

The Fisherian approach, developed by Sir Ronald Fisher, focuses on the concept of significance testing. This framework emphasizes the use of p-values to assess the evidence against a null hypothesis (\(H_0\)).

#### Key Concepts

1. **Null Hypothesis (\(H_0\))**: The hypothesis that there is no effect or no difference. It serves as the default assumption.
   
2. **P-value**: The probability of obtaining a test statistic at least as extreme as the one observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true. A low p-value indicates strong evidence against \(H_0\).
   
3. **Significance Level (\(\alpha\))**: A threshold set by the researcher to determine whether the p-value is low enough to reject \(H_0\). Common choices are \(\alpha = 0.05\), \(\alpha = 0.01\), etc.

#### Procedure

1. **State the Null Hypothesis**: Formulate \(H_0\).
2. **Collect Data**: Gather sample data and compute the test statistic.
3. **Compute P-value**: Calculate the p-value based on the test statistic.
4. **Decision Rule**: Compare the p-value to the significance level \(\alpha\):
   - If \(p \leq \alpha\), reject \(H_0\).
   - If \(p > \alpha\), do not reject \(H_0\).

#### Example

In testing whether a coin is fair (\(H_0\): the coin is fair), we might perform a binomial test. If we flip the coin 100 times and get 60 heads, the p-value will indicate how likely it is to get such a result if the coin is truly fair.

### Neyman-Pearson Framework

The Neyman-Pearson framework, developed by Jerzy Neyman and Egon Pearson, emphasizes hypothesis testing through the use of decision rules and error rates. It introduces the concept of alternative hypotheses (\(H_1\)) and focuses on controlling Type I and Type II errors.

#### Key Concepts

1. **Null Hypothesis (\(H_0\))**: The hypothesis that there is no effect or no difference.
   
2. **Alternative Hypothesis (\(H_1\))**: The hypothesis that there is an effect or a difference.
   
3. **Type I Error (\(\alpha\))**: The probability of rejecting \(H_0\) when it is true. Also known as the significance level.
   
4. **Type II Error (\(\beta\))**: The probability of failing to reject \(H_0\) when \(H_1\) is true.
   
5. **Power of the Test (\(1 - \beta\))**: The probability of correctly rejecting \(H_0\) when \(H_1\) is true.

#### Procedure

1. **State the Hypotheses**: Formulate \(H_0\) and \(H_1\).
2. **Determine Significance Level (\(\alpha\))**: Set the acceptable probability of Type I error.
3. **Collect Data**: Gather sample data and compute the test statistic.
4. **Determine the Critical Region**: Define the region in which \(H_0\) will be rejected, based on \(\alpha\).
5. **Make a Decision**: Compare the test statistic to the critical region:
   - If the test statistic falls in the critical region, reject \(H_0\).
   - If the test statistic does not fall in the critical region, do not reject \(H_0\).

#### Example

In testing whether a new drug is more effective than a standard treatment (\(H_0\): no difference, \(H_1\): new drug is better), we might perform a two-sample \(t\)-test. We define \(\alpha = 0.05\) and calculate the power of the test to ensure it is high enough (e.g., 0.8).

### Comparison of Frameworks

1. **Philosophical Approach**:
   - **Fisherian**: Focuses on the strength of evidence against \(H_0\) using p-values.
   - **Neyman-Pearson**: Focuses on decision-making with controlled error rates.

2. **Hypotheses**:
   - **Fisherian**: Primarily concerns \(H_0\); \(H_1\) is implicit.
   - **Neyman-Pearson**: Explicitly considers both \(H_0\) and \(H_1\).

3. **Error Types**:
   - **Fisherian**: Controls Type I error through the significance level \(\alpha\).
   - **Neyman-Pearson**: Controls both Type I and Type II errors, emphasizing the power of the test.

4. **Decision Rule**:
   - **Fisherian**: Based on p-value relative to \(\alpha\).
   - **Neyman-Pearson**: Based on critical regions and predefined \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\).

5. **Interpretation**:
   - **Fisherian**: A p-value provides a measure of evidence against \(H_0\).
   - **Neyman-Pearson**: A test result leads to a decision about rejecting \(H_0\) or not, with known probabilities of making errors.

### Conclusion

Both the Fisherian and Neyman-Pearson frameworks offer robust methods for hypothesis testing but serve different purposes and are based on different philosophies. The Fisherian approach is valuable for assessing the strength of evidence against a null hypothesis, while the Neyman-Pearson framework is crucial for decision-making with controlled error rates. Understanding these differences allows researchers to choose the appropriate method for their specific research context.
