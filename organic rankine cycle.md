Organic Rankine Cycle


**ASSISTANT**

The **Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC)** is a thermodynamic process used for converting low-grade heat into useful mechanical or electrical power. It is an adaptation of the traditional Rankine cycle but employs an organic fluid (a refrigerant or hydrocarbon) with a lower boiling point than water. This makes the ORC particularly effective for exploiting heat sources that are too low in temperature for a conventional Rankine cycle, such as industrial waste heat, geothermal energy, biomass combustion, or solar thermal energy.

### Components of the Organic Rankine Cycle
The ORC consists of the following key components:
1. **Evaporator (or Boiler):** 
   - The working fluid is vaporized by absorbing heat from a heat source. In an ORC, the fluid typically has a lower boiling point than water, allowing vaporization at lower temperatures.
  
2. **Expander (or Turbine):**
   - The high-pressure vapor drives an expander, typically a turbine, generating mechanical work that can be converted into electricity using a generator. The type of expander used can vary based on the scale and specific application of the ORC.

3. **Condenser:**
   - After expansion, the low-pressure vapor is condensed by releasing heat to a cooling source (e.g., air or water). This process returns the working fluid to its liquid state.

4. **Pump:**
   - The liquid working fluid is pumped back to the evaporator, where it is pressurized and the cycle begins again.

### Thermodynamic Cycle Description
The ORC operates similarly to the standard Rankine cycle but utilizes organic fluids, such as refrigerants (e.g., R245fa, R134a) or hydrocarbons (e.g., butane, pentane), instead of water. The choice of working fluid depends on the temperature of the heat source and other system requirements.

The cycle can be described in four main stages:

1. **Isentropic Compression (1→2):**
   - The liquid working fluid is compressed by the pump, increasing its pressure without a significant change in entropy. The work input to the pump is relatively small due to the fluid being in a liquid state.

   $$ W_{\text{pump}} = h_2 - h_1 $$

   Where $h_1$ and $h_2$ are the specific enthalpies at the pump inlet and outlet, respectively.

2. **Isobaric Heat Addition (2→3):**
   - The high-pressure liquid enters the evaporator, where it absorbs heat $Q_{\text{in}}$ at constant pressure and vaporizes into a high-pressure gas.

   $$ Q_{\text{in}} = h_3 - h_2 $$

   Here, $h_3$ is the specific enthalpy of the vapor at the evaporator exit.

3. **Isentropic Expansion (3→4):**
   - The vapor expands through the turbine, performing work $W_{\text{turbine}}$ as it drives the turbine blades. The expansion is ideally isentropic (no change in entropy).

   $$ W_{\text{turbine}} = h_3 - h_4 $$

   Where $h_4$ is the specific enthalpy at the turbine exit.

4. **Isobaric Heat Rejection (4→1):**
   - The low-pressure vapor enters the condenser, where it releases heat $Q_{\text{out}}$ at constant pressure, condensing back into a liquid.

   $$ Q_{\text{out}} = h_4 - h_1 $$

### Efficiency Considerations
The thermal efficiency $\eta_{\text{thermal}}$ of the ORC is defined as the ratio of the net work output to the heat input:

$$ \eta_{\text{thermal}} = \frac{W_{\text{net}}}{Q_{\text{in}}} = \frac{(W_{\text{turbine}} - W_{\text{pump}})}{Q_{\text{in}}} $$

Due to the lower temperature differences in ORC applications, the thermal efficiency is typically lower than that of a conventional steam Rankine cycle. However, the ORC's ability to utilize low-temperature heat sources makes it a valuable technology in energy recovery and renewable energy systems.

### Working Fluid Selection
The choice of the organic working fluid is crucial and depends on several factors:
- **Boiling Point:** The fluid must vaporize at a temperature suitable for the available heat source.
- **Thermal Stability:** The fluid must remain stable under the operating temperatures.
- **Environmental and Safety Considerations:** Fluids should have low toxicity, be non-flammable, and have minimal environmental impact.

### Applications
The ORC is widely used in:
- **Waste Heat Recovery:** Capturing and converting heat from industrial processes.
- **Geothermal Power Plants:** Exploiting low-temperature geothermal resources.
- **Biomass Power Generation:** Converting heat from biomass combustion into power.
- **Solar Thermal Plants:** Harnessing concentrated solar power.

In conclusion, the Organic Rankine Cycle is a versatile and efficient means of converting low-temperature heat sources into electrical power, playing a crucial role in enhancing energy efficiency and supporting sustainable energy solutions.
