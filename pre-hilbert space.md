title: pre-hilbert space

**USER**

pre-Hilbert space


**ASSISTANT**

A **pre-Hilbert space** is a vector space equipped with an inner product, which lays the foundational structure necessary for defining a Hilbert space. However, unlike Hilbert spaces, pre-Hilbert spaces are not required to be complete with respect to the norm induced by the inner product. The completion of a pre-Hilbert space, where all Cauchy sequences converge within the space, results in a Hilbert space.

### Definition

Formally, a pre-Hilbert space is defined as a complex vector space $V$ together with an inner product $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle : V \times V \to \mathbb{C}$. This inner product satisfies the following properties:

1. **Conjugate Symmetry**:
   $$ \langle x, y \rangle = \overline{\langle y, x \rangle} \quad \text{for all } x, y \in V. $$

2. **Linearity in the First Argument**:
   $$ \langle \alpha x + \beta y, z \rangle = \alpha \langle x, z \rangle + \beta \langle y, z \rangle \quad \text{for all } x, y, z \in V \text{ and scalars } \alpha, \beta. $$

3. **Positive Definiteness**:
   $$ \langle x, x \rangle \geq 0 \text{ with equality if and only if } x = 0. $$

From the inner product, one can induce a norm $||x||$ on $V$ by
$$ ||x|| = \sqrt{\langle x, x \rangle}. $$
This norm turns $V$ into a normed space, and the norm satisfies the properties of a vector space norm, including the triangle inequality and homogeneity.

### Completeness and Relationship to Hilbert Spaces

A pre-Hilbert space becomes a Hilbert space when it is complete relative to the norm induced by the inner product. In other words, a Hilbert space is a complete pre-Hilbert space. Completeness here means that every Cauchy sequence in the space converges to a limit in the space. If a pre-Hilbert space is not complete, it can be "completed" by a process similar to the completion of rational numbers to real numbers, involving limits of Cauchy sequences.

### Examples

1. **Finite-Dimensional Vector Spaces**: Any finite-dimensional vector space with an inner product (such as $\mathbb{R}^n$ or $\mathbb{C}^n$ with the standard inner product) is automatically a Hilbert space because finite-dimensional normed spaces are complete.

2. **Function Spaces**: The space of square-integrable functions over an interval, with the inner product defined by
   $$ \langle f, g \rangle = \int f(x) \overline{g(x)} \, dx, $$
   forms a pre-Hilbert space. This space, often denoted as $L^2$, is a Hilbert space provided it includes equivalence classes of functions differing only on a set of measure zero (ensuring completeness).

3. **Sequence Spaces**: The space of square-summable sequences, $\ell^2$, with the inner product
   $$ \langle \{a_n\}, \{b_n\} \rangle = \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n \overline{b_n}, $$
   is a classic example of a complete pre-Hilbert space, thus a Hilbert space.

### Importance in Mathematics and Physics

Pre-Hilbert spaces are fundamental in many areas of mathematics and physics, particularly in functional analysis, where they provide the groundwork for the theory of Hilbert spaces. In physics, they are crucial for formulating quantum mechanics, where the state space of a system is modeled as a Hilbert space, and pre-Hilbert spaces often serve as the starting point for constructing these spaces through completion. The concept also underlies many of the spectral methods used in differential equations and numerical analysis, illustrating the broad utility and foundational importance of pre-Hilbert spaces in both theoretical and applied contexts.
