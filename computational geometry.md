[[Computational Geometry]] is a branch of computer science and mathematics that focuses on the study of algorithms and data structures for solving geometric problems. These problems arise in various applications, including computer graphics, robotics, geographic information systems (GIS), and more. The goal is to design efficient algorithms for processing geometric data.

## Key Concepts and Techniques

### Geometric Objects
- **Points**: The most basic geometric object, representing a location in space.
- **Lines and Segments**: Infinite lines and finite line segments connecting two points.
- **Polygons**: Closed shapes with straight edges (vertices connected by edges).
- **Polytopes**: Generalization of polygons to higher dimensions (e.g., polyhedra in 3D).
- **Circles, Ellipses, and Spheres**: Shapes defined by their radii and centers.

### Problems and Algorithms

1. **Convex Hull**
   - **Problem**: Given a set of points, find the smallest convex polygon (or polytope in higher dimensions) that contains all the points.
   - **Algorithms**: Graham's scan, Jarvis march (gift wrapping), Quickhull.

2. **Voronoi Diagrams and Delaunay Triangulations**
   - **Problem**: Partition a plane with \( n \) points into regions such that each region contains all the points closer to one specific point than to any other.
   - **Algorithms**: Fortune's sweep line algorithm, incremental algorithms.

3. **Intersection Problems**
   - **Problem**: Determine if and where geometric objects (lines, segments, polygons) intersect.
   - **Algorithms**: Bentley-Ottmann algorithm for line segment intersections, sweep line algorithms.

4. **Point Location**
   - **Problem**: Determine the region containing a query point in a planar subdivision.
   - **Algorithms**: Trapezoidal map and randomized incremental construction.

5. **Range Searching**
   - **Problem**: Given a set of points, find all points within a specified range (e.g., rectangle, circle).
   - **Data Structures**: k-d trees, range trees, segment trees.

6. **Proximity Problems**
   - **Problem**: Find the nearest or farthest point(s) to a given point.
   - **Algorithms**: Nearest neighbor search using k-d trees, Voronoi diagrams.

7. **Geometric Optimization**
   - **Problems**: Include finding the smallest enclosing circle, minimum spanning tree in geometric graphs.
   - **Algorithms**: Weiszfeld's algorithm for smallest enclosing circle, Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms for MSTs.

## Computational Complexity
The complexity of geometric algorithms is often analyzed in terms of:
- **Time Complexity**: The number of operations required to solve a problem relative to the size of the input.
- **Space Complexity**: The amount of memory required to solve a problem relative to the size of the input.

### Common Techniques
- **Divide and Conquer**: Split the problem into smaller subproblems, solve them independently, and combine their solutions (e.g., Quickhull for convex hulls).
- **Sweep Line**: Move a line across the plane and handle events in a specific order (e.g., Bentley-Ottmann for line intersections).
- **Incremental Construction**: Build the solution incrementally by adding one element at a time (e.g., Delaunay triangulation).

## Applications

### Computer Graphics
- **Rendering**: Efficiently determining visibility and shading of objects.
- **Modeling**: Constructing and manipulating geometric models.

### Robotics
- **Path Planning**: Finding collision-free paths for robots.
- **Sensor Networks**: Analyzing the coverage and connectivity of sensors.

### Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
- **Spatial Analysis**: Analyzing geographic data for urban planning, resource management.
- **Map Overlay**: Combining different map layers to extract useful information.

### Computer-Aided Design (CAD)
- **Modeling**: Designing and analyzing geometric models for engineering applications.
- **Manufacturing**: Planning and verifying manufacturing processes.
