(concrete/likely/common/discreptive) basis directions of the value space, according to modern psychology


**ASSISTANT**

In the context of modeling values within a psychological framework, the value space can be spanned by a set of basis directions that represent core human values. These basis directions can be informed by various theories and empirical research in psychology, particularly those that categorize values into distinct types. A well-regarded model for this purpose is the Schwartz theory of basic values, which identifies ten motivational types of values, each representing a fundamental, broad goal.

### Schwartz's Theory of Basic Values

Shalom Schwartz developed his theory through extensive empirical studies across various cultures, aiming to identify universal components of values. He proposes that values are organized in a circular structure, which can be interpreted as a manifold in higher-dimensional space. Here are the ten basic values, which can serve as basis directions in the values space:

1. **Power**: Social status and prestige, control or dominance over people and resources.
2. **Achievement**: Personal success through demonstrating competence according to social standards.
3. **Hedonism**: Pleasure and sensuous gratification for oneself.
4. **Stimulation**: Excitement, novelty, and challenge in life.
5. **Self-direction**: Independent thought and actionâ€”choosing, creating, exploring.
6. **Universalism**: Understanding, appreciation, tolerance, and protection for the welfare of all people and for nature.
7. **Benevolence**: Preserving and enhancing the welfare of those with whom one is in frequent personal contact (the 'in-group').
8. **Tradition**: Respect, commitment, and acceptance of the customs and ideas that one's culture or religion provides.
9. **Conformity**: Restraint of actions, inclinations, and impulses likely to upset or harm others and violate social expectations or norms.
10. **Security**: Safety, harmony, and stability of society, of relationships, and of self.

### Geometric Interpretation in Values Space

Each of these values represents a direction in the multidimensional values space. The interactions and conflicts between these values (as posited in Schwartz's circular model) suggest that the manifold is not flat but curved, and the relationship between different values can be understood in terms of the geometric properties discussed previously, such as curvature.

#### Curvature and Dynamics in Values Space:
- **Curvature Around a Value**: The curvature around a point in this space could represent the resistance to moving away from a particular value. For example, high curvature around "Tradition" could imply a strong resistance to adopting values associated with "Stimulation" or "Hedonism".
- **Transition Between Values**: The paths or geodesics between values like "Security" and "Achievement" can demonstrate how one might prioritize stability versus personal success, influenced by internal motivations or external circumstances.

### Application in Psychological Studies

In practice, psychologists and researchers can use these basis directions to assess individual or group value systems, predict behavior, and understand changes in value orientation due to life experiences or societal shifts. Tools such as surveys designed around Schwartz's value inventory help in quantifying the importance of each value to an individual, providing a concrete way to map individuals in the values space.

Understanding these dynamics and basis directions not only enriches psychological theory but also provides practical insights into areas such as marketing, organizational behavior, and social policy, where understanding human values is crucial.
