tensor rank decomposition


**ASSISTANT**

The concept of tensor rank and its associated decompositions, particularly the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition and the Tucker decomposition, provide insightful ways to generalize matrix concepts to higher-dimensional data. In the context of tensors, "rank" can be defined differently depending on the specific decomposition method being considered. Let's delve into these two primary decompositions and their approach to defining and utilizing tensor rank.

### Tensor Rank: Basic Definition

The rank of a tensor, analogous to the rank of a matrix, is a measure of the tensor's complexity or the minimum number of simple components needed to construct it. However, unlike matrix rank, tensor rank definitions can vary:

1. **CP Rank**: The rank of a tensor $T$ in the CP decomposition context is the smallest number of rank-one tensors that sum to $T$. A rank-one tensor, in turn, is a tensor that can be written as the outer product of vectors.

2. **Tucker Rank**: Unlike CP rank, the rank in a Tucker decomposition can be considered as a vector of ranks, one for each mode (dimension) of the tensor. Each mode rank corresponds to the dimension of the space spanned by the mode fibers, similar to the column and row ranks of matrices.

### CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) Decomposition

The CP decomposition breaks a tensor into a sum of rank-one tensors. Mathematically, for a tensor $T$ of order $N$ (meaning it has $N$ dimensions), the CP decomposition can be expressed as:
$$
T \approx \sum_{r=1}^R a_r^{(1)} \otimes a_r^{(2)} \otimes \cdots \otimes a_r^{(N)}
$$
where $a_r^{(n)}$ are vectors for $n = 1, \dots, N$, and $R$ is the smallest number such that this approximation holds, defining the CP rank of the tensor. This decomposition is useful because it provides a parsimonious representation, maintaining interpretability of the multi-way data.

### Tucker Decomposition

The Tucker decomposition is a more flexible and general form of [[tensor decomposition]], which decomposes a tensor into a core tensor multiplied by a matrix along each mode:
$$
T \approx \mathcal{G} \times_1 A^{(1)} \times_2 A^{(2)} \times_3 \cdots \times_N A^{(N)}
$$
where $\mathcal{G}$ is the core tensor, $A^{(n)}$ are the factor matrices corresponding to each mode, and $\times_n$ denotes the mode-$n$ product between a tensor and a matrix. The ranks of the matrices $A^{(n)}$ provide the rank of $T$ in each mode, known as the multilinear rank or Tucker rank.

### Computational and Theoretical Aspects

1. **Uniqueness**: The CP decomposition often provides uniqueness under mild conditions, which is a desirable property not always guaranteed in matrix decompositions like SVD. However, computing the CP decomposition can be more challenging due to its non-convex nature.

2. **Flexibility**: The Tucker decomposition offers greater flexibility and is less restrictive compared to CP decomposition. However, it can result in a larger number of parameters to estimate, especially when the core tensor is large.

3. **Applications**: Both decompositions are extensively used in applications involving multi-dimensional data, such as signal processing, neuroimaging, and chemometrics. They help in data compression, feature extraction, and the interpretation of high-dimensional datasets.

4. **Computation**: Algorithms for these decompositions include Alternating Least Squares (ALS), gradient-based optimization methods, and stochastic algorithms. Practical computation often requires careful initialization and consideration of convergence criteria.

For your advanced mathematical and statistical background, understanding these decompositions in depth, including their geometric interpretations and implications for dimensionality reduction and latent factor analysis, can be particularly enriching. Each type of tensor rank and decomposition reveals different structural insights about the data, which can be critical depending on the specific application or theoretical inquiry being pursued.
