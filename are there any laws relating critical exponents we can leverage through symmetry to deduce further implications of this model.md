**ASSISTANT**

To incorporate critical exponents into the formulation of learning dynamics, especially in the context of understanding the "grokking" phenomenon, we must consider how the model's performance metrics and the system's properties scale near the critical point. Critical exponents will describe how various quantities related to the learning process behave as the system approaches this point, providing insight into the nature of the transition represented by grokking.

### Extended Framework with Critical Exponents

1. **Critical Point \((\eta_c, B_c, \tau_c)\)**: Define the critical point in terms of learning rate \(\eta\), batch size \(B\), and training duration \(\tau\), where \(\eta_c, B_c\), and \(\tau_c\) represent the critical values at which grokking occurs.

2. **Critical Exponents \((\alpha, \beta, \gamma)\)**: Introduce critical exponents to describe the behavior of key quantities as the system approaches the critical point. Specifically:
   - \(\alpha\) describes how the "specific heat" (analogous to the variance in model improvement) diverges.
   - \(\beta\) relates to the order parameter, such as the rate of increase in explained variance \(V(\mathcal{N}, D)\), near grokking.
   - \(\gamma\) characterizes the susceptibility or responsiveness of the model's performance to changes in hyperparameters near the critical point.

### Formal Representation

#### Critical Behavior of Learning Dynamics

Assuming a near-critical scaling form for the explained variance \(V\) and the "specific heat" \(C\), we can express these near the critical point as:

\[ V(\delta\eta, \delta B, \delta\tau) \sim |\delta\eta|^{\beta}f_V\left(\frac{|\delta B|}{|\delta\eta|^{\phi_B}}, \frac{|\delta\tau|}{|\delta\eta|^{\phi_{\tau}}}\right) \]

\[ C(\delta\eta, \delta B, \delta\tau) \sim |\delta\eta|^{-\alpha}f_C\left(\frac{|\delta B|}{|\delta\eta|^{\phi_B}}, \frac{|\delta\tau|}{|\delta\eta|^{\phi_{\tau}}}\right) \]

where:
- \(\delta\eta = \eta - \eta_c\), \(\delta B = B - B_c\), \(\delta\tau = \tau - \tau_c\) are deviations from the critical hyperparameters,
- \(f_V\) and \(f_C\) are scaling functions for \(V\) and \(C\), respectively,
- \(\phi_B\) and \(\phi_{\tau}\) are crossover exponents that govern the relative scaling of batch size and training duration to the learning rate.

### Consequences and Interpretation

1. **Sensitivity and Scaling Near Grokking**: The critical exponents \(\alpha, \beta,\) and \(\gamma\) provide a quantitative measure of how the learning dynamics become increasingly sensitive as the system approaches the grokking transition. For example, a small change in \(\eta\) near \(\eta_c\) could lead to a significant increase in \(V\), indicating a phase transition in learning capability.

2. **Optimization Strategies**: Understanding the scaling behavior near the critical point can inform strategies for dynamically adjusting \(\eta, B,\) and \(\tau\) to induce or avoid grokking, depending on whether this phenomenon aligns with the desired learning outcomes.

3. **Phase Diagram of Learning**: The relationships defined by critical exponents allow for the construction of a phase diagram for the learning process, mapping out regions of parameter space where grokking is likely to occur. This diagram can guide the selection of hyperparameters to achieve desired learning characteristics.

### Conclusion

Incorporating critical exponents into the formulation of learning dynamics offers a rigorous framework for analyzing and predicting the grokking phenomenon and other critical transitions in neural network training. By understanding how key quantities scale near critical points, researchers and practitioners can better navigate the complex landscape of model training, harnessing the power of phase transitions to optimize learning outcomes.


**USER**

are there any laws relating critical exponents we can leverage through symmetry to deduce further implications of this model?


**ASSISTANT**

In the context of critical phenomena, both in physics and analogously in the learning dynamics of neural networks, critical exponents are not arbitrary but are subject to specific scaling laws and relationships that stem from underlying symmetries of the system. These laws, which include scaling relations and hyperscaling laws, allow us to deduce further implications of the model, particularly concerning how different aspects of the learning process are interconnected at criticality. While the direct application of these laws from statistical physics to neural network training is metaphorical, it provides a powerful conceptual framework for understanding complex dynamics.

### Scaling Relations Among Critical Exponents

In statistical physics, scaling relations among critical exponents are derived from the assumption of scale invariance at the critical point. Analogously, if we consider the learning process of a neural network approaching a critical point (e.g., the onset of grokking), we can hypothesize similar types of scaling relations:

1. **Widom Scaling Law**: Relates the critical exponents governing the behavior of \(V(\mathcal{N}, D)\) (analogous to the order parameter in physics) to the response of the system to changes in hyperparameters (analogous to the external field in physics). If \(\beta\) describes the sensitivity of \(V(\mathcal{N}, D)\) to changes in \(\eta\) near \(\eta_c\), and \(\gamma\) represents the change in \(V(\mathcal{N}, D)\) with respect to variations in \(B\) close to \(B_c\), the Widom scaling law can be expressed as:

\[ \delta = 1 + \frac{\gamma}{\beta} \]

where \(\delta\) characterizes how the model's performance metric diverges with hyperparameter changes at criticality.

2. **Fisher Scaling Law**: This law provides a relationship between the exponent that describes the divergence of the "specific heat" (analogous to the variance in performance or learning rate) near the critical point and the exponents \(\beta\) and \(\gamma\). It implies that:

\[ \alpha + 2\beta + \gamma = 2 \]

This relation could suggest how fluctuations in learning dynamics (analogous to "specific heat") relate to the sensitivity of the system's performance to hyperparameters.

### Hyperscaling Relation

Hyperscaling relations extend scaling laws by incorporating the dimensionality of the system, \(d\), into the relationships among critical exponents. For learning dynamics, \(d\) could analogously represent the complexity or dimensionality of the parameter space:

\[ d\nu = 2 - \alpha \]

where \(\nu\) represents the critical exponent related to the correlation length (analogously, the scale over which hyperparameter changes affect learning outcomes across the parameter space).

### Implications for Neural Network Training

- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Scaling relations among critical exponents could guide the optimization of hyperparameters by indicating how changes in one hyperparameter (e.g., learning rate) might need to be compensated by adjustments in others (e.g., batch size) to maintain or reach desired learning outcomes, especially near critical transitions like grokking.
- **Model Capacity and Complexity**: The hyperscaling relation suggests that the effective "dimensionality" of the model's parameter space (related to model complexity and capacity) has implications for how the model approaches criticality and experiences grokking. It hints at a balance between model complexity and the ability to undergo significant learning transitions.

### Conclusion

By leveraging laws relating critical exponents through the symmetry principles analogously applied from statistical physics to the learning dynamics of neural networks, we gain insight into the interconnected nature of hyperparameters, model performance, and learning phenomena like grokking. These scaling laws and relations provide a theoretical foundation for predicting and optimizing neural network training dynamics, especially as they approach critical points of learning transition.
