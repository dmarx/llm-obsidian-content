Sen's theorem


**ASSISTANT**

**Sen's Theorem**, also known as "The Impossibility of a Paretian Liberal," is a result in social choice theory formulated by [[Amartya Sen|Sen]] that demonstrates the inherent conflict between individual rights (liberalism) and the Pareto principle (Pareto efficiency). The theorem shows that it is impossible to construct a social decision-making rule that respects both the Pareto principle and guarantees minimal individual rights.

### Key Concepts

1. **Pareto Principle (Pareto Efficiency):**
   - A social state is Pareto efficient if no one can be made better off without making someone else worse off.
   - Formally, for any two social states \(x\) and \(y\), if every individual prefers \(x\) over \(y\), then \(x\) should be socially preferred over \(y\).

2. **Minimal Liberalism:**
   - Each individual should have at least one personal decision where their preference is decisive.
   - Formally, for each individual \(i\), there exists at least one pair of social states \((x, y)\) such that if \(i\) prefers \(x\) over \(y\) (denoted \(x P_i y\)), then \(x\) is socially preferred to \(y\) (denoted \(x P y\)).

3. **Universal Domain:**
   - The social decision-making rule should be defined for every possible set of individual preferences.

### Formal Statement of Sen's Theorem

Sen's theorem states that no social decision-making rule can simultaneously satisfy the following three conditions:

1. **Universal Domain (UD):** The social decision rule must be applicable to any set of individual preference orderings.
2. **Pareto Principle (P):** If all individuals prefer social state \(x\) to social state \(y\), then the social preference should also prefer \(x\) to \(y\).
3. **Minimal Liberalism (L):** Each individual must have at least one personal sphere in which their preference is decisive in determining the social preference.

### Proof of Sen's Theorem

To understand the proof, consider a society with at least two individuals, say Alice and Bob, and three social states \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\).

1. **Preferences:**
   - Suppose Alice prefers \(x\) over \(y\) (i.e., \(x P_A y\)).
   - Suppose Bob prefers \(y\) over \(z\) (i.e., \(y P_B z\)).
   - Suppose Alice prefers \(z\) over \(x\) (i.e., \(z P_A x\)).

2. **Minimal Liberalism:**
   - Alice should have the decisive say in at least one pair of social states. Suppose Alice's decisive pair is \(x\) and \(y\), so if \(x P_A y\), then \(x P y\).

3. **Pareto Principle:**
   - If every individual prefers \(x\) to \(y\), then \(x\) should be socially preferred to \(y\).

Consider the preference profiles:

- \(x P_A y\) and \(y P_B x\): By Minimal Liberalism, since Alice's preference is decisive for the pair \(x\) and \(y\), we should have \(x P y\).

- \(y P_B z\) and \(z P_A y\): Suppose Bob's decisive pair is \(y\) and \(z\), so if \(y P_B z\), then \(y P z\).

- \(z P_A x\) and \(x P_B z\): By Minimal Liberalism, since Alice's preference is decisive for the pair \(z\) and \(x\), we should have \(z P x\).

Now consider the social preference ordering implied by these individual preferences:
- Since \(x P y\) (due to Alice's decisiveness) and \(y P z\) (due to Bob's decisiveness), by transitivity we should have \(x P z\).
- However, Alice prefers \(z\) over \(x\) (i.e., \(z P_A x\)), and if \(z P_A x\) and Alice's preference is decisive, we should have \(z P x\).

This creates a contradiction because we have both \(x P z\) and \(z P x\), which is impossible in a coherent preference ordering.

### Implications of Sen's Theorem

1. **Social Choice Theory:**
   - The theorem challenges the design of social choice mechanisms, indicating that it is impossible to fully respect individual rights while also achieving Pareto efficiency.

2. **Political Philosophy:**
   - Raises questions about the feasibility of liberal democratic systems that aim to respect individual freedoms and ensure collective welfare.

3. **Policy Design:**
   - Policymakers must recognize and navigate the trade-offs between protecting individual rights and pursuing collective efficiency.

### Conclusion

Sen's Theorem, or "The Impossibility of a Paretian Liberal," reveals a fundamental incompatibility between individual rights and the Pareto principle in social decision-making. This paradox has significant implications for theories of justice, democratic governance, and the design of social policies.
