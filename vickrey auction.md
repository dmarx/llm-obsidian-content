## Vickrey Auction

The **Vickrey auction**, named after economist William Vickrey, is a type of sealed-bid auction where the highest bidder wins but pays the second-highest bid. This auction format is also known as the **second-price sealed-bid auction**.

### Mechanism of Vickrey Auction

In a Vickrey auction, each bidder submits a single sealed bid without knowing the bids of the other participants. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Bidding**: Each participant submits their bid in a sealed envelope.
2. **Winning Bid**: The highest bid determines the winner.
3. **Payment**: The winner pays the amount of the second-highest bid.

### Incentive Compatibility

The Vickrey auction is **dominant strategy incentive compatible (DSIC)**, meaning that bidding one's true valuation is a dominant strategy for all participants. This property arises because:

- **Overbidding**: If a bidder bids more than their true valuation, they risk winning the auction at a price higher than their valuation, resulting in a negative utility.
- **Underbidding**: If a bidder bids less than their true valuation, they risk losing the auction even if they value the item more than the winning bid.

Thus, bidding truthfully maximizes a bidder's expected utility regardless of other bidders' actions.

### Example

Consider an auction with three bidders, each with the following valuations for the item:

- Bidder A: \$100
- Bidder B: \$150
- Bidder C: \$120

If each bidder submits a bid equal to their valuation, the bids are as follows:

- Bidder A: \$100
- Bidder B: \$150
- Bidder C: \$120

Bidder B wins the auction since they submitted the highest bid, but they pay the second-highest bid of \$120. Therefore, Bidder B's payment is \$120.

### Properties of Vickrey Auction

1. **Truthfulness**: As discussed, bidding one's true valuation is a dominant strategy.
2. **Efficiency**: The auction allocates the item to the bidder who values it the most, leading to an efficient outcome.
3. **Simplicity**: The bidding process is straightforward since bidders do not need to strategize beyond submitting their true valuations.

### Mathematical Formalism

Let's denote the bidders' valuations as \(v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n\) and their corresponding bids as \(b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n\). The winner is the bidder with the highest bid, say bidder \(i\), and the price they pay is the second-highest bid, denoted as \(b_{(2)}\).

The utility \(U_i\) for bidder \(i\) with true valuation \(v_i\) and bid \(b_i\) is given by:

$$
U_i = \begin{cases} 
v_i - b_{(2)} & \text{if } b_i = b_{(1)} \\
0 & \text{otherwise} 
\end{cases}
$$

where \(b_{(1)}\) is the highest bid and \(b_{(2)}\) is the second-highest bid.

### Comparison with First-Price Sealed-Bid Auction

In a **[[first-price sealed-bid auction]]**, the highest bidder wins and pays their bid. This format requires bidders to shade their bids below their true valuations to balance the probability of winning with the utility of paying a lower price. The bidding strategy is more complex and less straightforward than in a Vickrey auction.

### Applications

The Vickrey auction's properties make it suitable for various applications:

- **Online Advertising**: Ad slots on search engines and social media platforms are often allocated using Vickrey-like auctions.
- **Spectrum Auctions**: Governments allocate electromagnetic spectrum to telecom companies using mechanisms inspired by the Vickrey auction.
- **Combinatorial Auctions**: For selling multiple items where bidders can place bids on combinations of items, Vickrey auctions ensure truthful bidding.

### Limitations

Despite its advantages, the Vickrey auction has some limitations:

- **Bidder Collusion**: If bidders collude, they can manipulate the auction to pay less than the true second-highest valuation.
- **Complex Valuation Structures**: In auctions with complex interdependencies between items (e.g., combinatorial auctions), determining the second-highest bid can be computationally challenging.

### Conclusion

The Vickrey auction is a powerful mechanism in [[auction theory]], promoting truthful bidding and efficient allocation of resources. Its simplicity and dominant strategy incentive compatibility make it a preferred choice in various applications.
