New Keynesian Phillips curve


**ASSISTANT**

The New Keynesian Phillips Curve (NKPC) is a fundamental equation in New Keynesian economics that describes the relationship between inflation and economic activity. It integrates microeconomic foundations, particularly price-setting behavior of firms, into the analysis of inflation dynamics.

### Key Concepts

1. **Price Stickiness and Calvo Pricing**:
   The NKPC is derived under the assumption of price stickiness, often modeled using the Calvo pricing mechanism. In this framework, only a fraction of firms can adjust their prices in any given period, leading to staggered price adjustments across the economy.

2. **Forward-Looking Behavior**:
   Unlike the traditional Phillips Curve, which relates current inflation to past economic activity, the NKPC emphasizes the role of expectations. Firms set prices based on their expectations of future economic conditions, making inflation dynamics inherently forward-looking.

3. **Real Marginal Cost**:
   The NKPC links inflation to real marginal cost rather than output gaps. Real marginal cost is often proxied by the labor share of income, reflecting the cost of producing an additional unit of output.

### Mathematical Derivation

The NKPC can be derived from a model where firms face nominal rigidities and optimize their pricing decisions over time. The standard derivation involves the following steps:

1. **Firms' Price Setting**:
   Firms set prices to maximize the expected present value of their future profits. In the presence of Calvo pricing, a firm that can adjust its price at time $t$ sets its new price $\bar{P}_t$ to maximize:
   $$
   \mathbb{E}_t \left[ \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (\beta \theta)^k \left( P_t Y_{t+k}(i) - MC_{t+k} Y_{t+k}(i) \right) \right]
   $$
   where $\beta$ is the discount factor, $\theta$ is the probability of not adjusting prices, $P_t$ is the price level, $Y_{t+k}(i)$ is the output of firm $i$ at time $t+k$, and $MC_{t+k}$ is the marginal cost.

2. **Optimal Reset Price**:
   The optimal reset price $\bar{P}_t$ is given by:
   $$
   \bar{P}_t = (1+\mu) \frac{\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (\beta \theta)^k \mathbb{E}_t [P_{t+k} MC_{t+k} Y_{t+k}]}{\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (\beta \theta)^k \mathbb{E}_t [P_{t+k} Y_{t+k}]}
   $$
   where $\mu$ is the markup over marginal cost.

3. **Aggregate Price Level**:
   The aggregate price level $P_t$ evolves as a weighted average of the new prices set by firms and the prices of firms that do not adjust:
   $$
   P_t = \left[ (1-\theta) \bar{P}_t^{1-\epsilon} + \theta P_{t-1}^{1-\epsilon} \right]^{\frac{1}{1-\epsilon}}
   $$

4. **Inflation Dynamics**:
   Linearizing the model around the steady state and solving for inflation $\pi_t = \frac{P_t}{P_{t-1}} - 1$ yields the NKPC:
   $$
   \pi_t = \beta \mathbb{E}_t [\pi_{t+1}] + \kappa (MC_t)
   $$
   where $\kappa = \frac{(1-\theta)(1-\beta\theta)}{\theta}$ reflects the degree of price stickiness, and $MC_t$ is the real marginal cost.

### Interpretation

1. **Forward-Looking Inflation**:
   The NKPC indicates that current inflation depends on expected future inflation and real marginal cost. This forward-looking nature implies that expectations of future economic conditions play a crucial role in determining present inflation.

2. **Policy Implications**:
   Because inflation is influenced by expectations, credible and systematic monetary policy can anchor these expectations and stabilize inflation. Central banks can use policy tools to manage expectations and reduce inflation volatility.

3. **Real Marginal Cost**:
   The real marginal cost, often proxied by the output gap or the labor share of income, captures the cyclical pressures on prices. When the economy is operating above its potential (high real marginal cost), inflation tends to rise, and vice versa.

### Applications

The NKPC is central to [[Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) Models|DSGE models]], which are used to analyze the effects of monetary and fiscal policies on the economy. It provides a framework for understanding the transmission of policy through expectations and price-setting behavior.

### Example

Consider an economy experiencing a positive demand shock. Firms expect higher future demand and potential cost pressures, leading them to raise prices in anticipation. This expectation feeds into the NKPC, causing current inflation to rise even before the actual demand materializes. A central bank aware of this mechanism might preemptively adjust interest rates to manage expectations and stabilize inflation.

In conclusion, the New Keynesian Phillips Curve is a vital tool for understanding inflation dynamics in modern macroeconomic theory. It bridges microeconomic price-setting behavior with macroeconomic outcomes, highlighting the importance of expectations and real marginal costs in driving inflation.
