Dynamical Mean Field Theory


**ASSISTANT**

Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) is an advanced extension of mean field theory that incorporates local temporal fluctuations to accurately describe the behavior of strongly correlated electron systems. It provides a framework for understanding complex phenomena such as metal-insulator transitions, magnetism, and superconductivity in materials where electron interactions are significant.

## Overview

### Core Idea

DMFT approximates the behavior of a lattice model by mapping it onto an effective single-site problem. This single site is embedded in a self-consistent bath that represents the influence of the rest of the lattice. Unlike static mean field theories, DMFT retains the dynamic (temporal) aspects of electron interactions.

### Mathematical Formalism

Consider a lattice model described by the Hubbard Hamiltonian:

$$
H = -t \sum_{\langle i, j \rangle, \sigma} (c_{i\sigma}^\dagger c_{j\sigma} + \text{H.c.}) + U \sum_i n_{i\uparrow} n_{i\downarrow} - \mu \sum_{i, \sigma} n_{i\sigma}
$$

where:
- \( t \) is the hopping parameter,
- \( U \) is the on-site Coulomb interaction,
- \( c_{i\sigma}^\dagger \) and \( c_{i\sigma} \) are the creation and annihilation operators for electrons with spin \(\sigma\) at site \(i\),
- \( n_{i\sigma} = c_{i\sigma}^\dagger c_{i\sigma} \) is the number operator,
- \(\mu\) is the chemical potential.

### Effective Single-Site Problem

DMFT maps this lattice problem onto an effective single-site problem described by an Anderson impurity model:

$$
H_{\text{imp}} = \sum_{k, \sigma} \epsilon_k c_{k\sigma}^\dagger c_{k\sigma} + \sum_{\sigma} (\epsilon_d - \mu) d_\sigma^\dagger d_\sigma + U n_{d\uparrow} n_{d\downarrow} + \sum_{k, \sigma} (V_k c_{k\sigma}^\dagger d_\sigma + \text{H.c.})
$$

where:
- \( d_\sigma^\dagger \) and \( d_\sigma \) are the creation and annihilation operators for the impurity site,
- \( \epsilon_k \) and \( V_k \) describe the conduction bath.

### Self-Consistency Condition

The bath is determined self-consistently by the requirement that the impurity Green's function \( G_{\text{imp}}(\omega) \) matches the local Green's function of the lattice model \( G_{\text{loc}}(\omega) \):

$$
G_{\text{loc}}(\omega) = \int d\epsilon \, \rho(\epsilon) \, \frac{1}{\omega + \mu - \Sigma(\omega) - \epsilon}
$$

Here, \( \rho(\epsilon) \) is the density of states of the non-interacting lattice, and \( \Sigma(\omega) \) is the self-energy, which in DMFT is local (site-dependent but not momentum-dependent).

The impurity Green's function \( G_{\text{imp}}(\omega) \) is given by:

$$
G_{\text{imp}}(\omega) = \frac{1}{\omega + \mu - \Delta(\omega) - \Sigma(\omega)}
$$

where \( \Delta(\omega) \) is the hybridization function describing the coupling to the bath.

### Iterative Solution

The DMFT equations are solved iteratively:
1. Start with an initial guess for the self-energy \( \Sigma(\omega) \).
2. Solve the effective impurity problem to obtain \( G_{\text{imp}}(\omega) \).
3. Update the local Green's function \( G_{\text{loc}}(\omega) \) using the lattice density of states.
4. Compute a new self-energy \( \Sigma(\omega) \).
5. Repeat until convergence.

### Applications

DMFT has been applied to various strongly correlated systems, providing insights into:
- **Metal-Insulator Transitions**: Understanding the Mott transition where a material changes from a metal to an insulator due to electron-electron interactions.
- **Magnetism**: Describing magnetic properties and phase transitions in correlated electron systems.
- **Superconductivity**: Investigating unconventional superconductivity in high-temperature superconductors and [[heavy fermion systems]].
- **Multiband Systems**: Extending to materials with multiple interacting orbitals, such as transition metal oxides.

### Extensions

DMFT can be combined with other theoretical approaches to enhance its applicability:
- **LDA+DMFT**: Combines Density Functional Theory (DFT) in the Local Density Approximation (LDA) with DMFT to study real materials.
- **Cluster DMFT (CDMFT)**: Extends DMFT to consider clusters of sites instead of a single site, capturing short-range spatial correlations.
- **Non-Equilibrium DMFT**: Extends DMFT to study time-dependent phenomena and non-equilibrium processes.
