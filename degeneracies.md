title: degeneracies

**USER**

degeneracies


**ASSISTANT**

In the context of linear algebra and quantum mechanics, degeneracies refer to the situation where two or more eigenvalues of an operator are identical. This means there are multiple linearly independent eigenvectors corresponding to the same eigenvalue. Degeneracies are significant in various physical systems because they often lead to enhanced symmetries and interesting physical phenomena.

### Types of Degeneracies

1. **Accidental Degeneracy**:
   Accidental degeneracy occurs when eigenvalues coincide due to specific parameter values but without any underlying symmetry enforcing it. This type of degeneracy can often be removed by small perturbations.

2. **Symmetry-Induced Degeneracy**:
   Symmetry-induced degeneracy arises due to the presence of symmetries in the system. For instance, in atomic physics, the degeneracy of energy levels in a hydrogen atom is due to the spherical symmetry of the Coulomb potential.

### Mathematical Formalism

Consider a linear operator \(A\) on a vector space \(V\). The eigenvalue equation is:
$$
A \psi_i = \lambda_i \psi_i
$$
A degeneracy occurs if for some eigenvalue \(\lambda\), there are multiple linearly independent eigenvectors, say \(\psi_1, \psi_2, \ldots, \psi_k\), such that:
$$
A \psi_1 = \lambda \psi_1, \quad A \psi_2 = \lambda \psi_2, \quad \ldots, \quad A \psi_k = \lambda \psi_k
$$

The degeneracy of the eigenvalue \(\lambda\) is the dimension of the eigenspace corresponding to \(\lambda\), i.e., the number of linearly independent eigenvectors associated with \(\lambda\).

### Physical Examples

1. **Quantum Mechanics**:
   In quantum systems, degeneracies often arise due to underlying symmetries. For instance, the energy levels of the hydrogen atom exhibit degeneracy due to rotational symmetry. The energy eigenvalues depend only on the principal quantum number \(n\), leading to \(n^2\)-fold degeneracy for each level \(n\).

2. **Solid State Physics**:
   In crystalline solids, degeneracies can arise at high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone. For example, at the Dirac points in graphene, the electronic states are degenerate, leading to the characteristic linear dispersion relation around these points.

### Example: Degeneracy in Hydrogen Atom

The Schr√∂dinger equation for the hydrogen atom is:
$$
H \psi = E \psi
$$
where \(H\) is the Hamiltonian of the hydrogen atom. The energy eigenvalues are given by:
$$
E_n = -\frac{13.6 \, \text{eV}}{n^2}
$$
where \(n\) is the principal quantum number. For each \(n\), the eigenvalue \(E_n\) is \((n^2)\)-fold degenerate, accounting for the different possible values of the angular momentum quantum numbers \(l\) and \(m\).

### Exceptional Points vs. Degeneracies

In non-Hermitian systems, degeneracies are characterized by exceptional points (EPs), where both eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce. In contrast, degeneracies in Hermitian systems involve only the eigenvalues coalescing while maintaining orthogonal eigenvectors.

### Mathematical Example: Symmetry-Induced Degeneracy

Consider a spin-1/2 particle in a magnetic field. The Hamiltonian is:
$$
H = -\gamma \mathbf{B} \cdot \mathbf{S}
$$
where \(\mathbf{B}\) is the magnetic field, \(\mathbf{S}\) is the spin operator, and \(\gamma\) is the gyromagnetic ratio. For \(\mathbf{B} = 0\), the Hamiltonian has a two-fold degeneracy corresponding to the spin-up and spin-down states:
$$
H \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} = 0 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad H \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = 0 \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
$$
This degeneracy is lifted when \(\mathbf{B} \neq 0\), leading to the Zeeman effect.

### Conclusion

Degeneracies play a crucial role in the study of physical systems, providing insights into the underlying symmetries and the structure of the system's state space. Understanding and manipulating degeneracies can lead to new physical phenomena and applications, from quantum computing to materials science. The concept of exceptional points in non-Hermitian systems further extends the richness of degeneracies, opening new avenues for research and technology.
