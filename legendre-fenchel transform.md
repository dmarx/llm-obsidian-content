## Legendre-Fenchel Transform

### Overview

The Legendre-Fenchel transform is a mathematical operation used in convex analysis and optimization. It provides a dual representation of a function, particularly useful in [[large deviations theory]], thermodynamics, and various fields requiring optimization. This transform maps a function to its convex conjugate, providing insights into the relationship between primal and dual optimization problems.

### Definition

Given a function \(f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R} \cup \{+\infty\}\), the Legendre-Fenchel transform \(f^*\) of \(f\) is defined as:

$$
f^*(y) = \sup_{x \in \mathbb{R}^n} \left( \langle y, x \rangle - f(x) \right),
$$

where \(\langle y, x \rangle\) denotes the inner product between \(y\) and \(x\).

### Properties

1. **Convexity**: If \(f\) is convex, then \(f^*\) is also convex.
2. **Lower Semi-Continuity**: If \(f\) is lower semi-continuous, then \(f^*\) is also lower semi-continuous.
3. **Biconjugate**: The Legendre-Fenchel transform of \(f^*\), denoted by \(f^{**}\), is the greatest lower semi-continuous convex function that majorizes \(f\). If \(f\) is convex and lower semi-continuous, then \(f = f^{**}\).

### Examples

#### Example 1: Quadratic Function

Consider the quadratic function \(f(x) = \frac{1}{2} x^2\). The Legendre-Fenchel transform is:

$$
f^*(y) = \sup_{x \in \mathbb{R}} \left( yx - \frac{1}{2} x^2 \right).
$$

To find the supremum, take the derivative with respect to \(x\) and set it to zero:

$$
\frac{d}{dx} \left( yx - \frac{1}{2} x^2 \right) = y - x = 0 \implies x = y.
$$

Substitute \(x = y\) back into the expression:

$$
f^*(y) = y \cdot y - \frac{1}{2} y^2 = \frac{1}{2} y^2.
$$

Thus, the Legendre-Fenchel transform of \(f(x) = \frac{1}{2} x^2\) is \(f^*(y) = \frac{1}{2} y^2\).

#### Example 2: Logarithmic Function

Consider the function \(f(x) = e^x\). The Legendre-Fenchel transform is:

$$
f^*(y) = \sup_{x \in \mathbb{R}} \left( yx - e^x \right).
$$

The supremum occurs where the derivative with respect to \(x\) is zero:

$$
\frac{d}{dx} \left( yx - e^x \right) = y - e^x = 0 \implies e^x = y \implies x = \log y.
$$

Substitute \(x = \log y\) back into the expression:

$$
f^*(y) = y \log y - y,
$$

for \(y > 0\). Thus, the Legendre-Fenchel transform of \(f(x) = e^x\) is \(f^*(y) = y \log y - y\).

### Applications

#### Large Deviations Theory

In [[large deviations theory]], the Legendre-Fenchel transform is used to derive rate functions. For a sequence of i.i.d. random variables with cumulant generating function \(\Lambda(\lambda)\), the rate function \(I(x)\) can be obtained by:

$$
I(x) = \sup_{\lambda} \left( \lambda x - \Lambda(\lambda) \right).
```

This transform connects the probabilistic behavior of sums of random variables to the rate at which probabilities of large deviations decay.

#### Thermodynamics

In thermodynamics, the Legendre transform (a special case of the Legendre-Fenchel transform) is used to switch between different thermodynamic potentials. For example, the Helmholtz free energy \(F(T, V)\) and the Gibbs free energy \(G(T, P)\) are related through a Legendre transform with respect to volume and pressure.

#### Optimization

The Legendre-Fenchel transform is widely used in optimization, particularly in duality theory. It helps in finding dual problems and understanding the relationships between primal and dual optimization problems.

### Duality

The Legendre-Fenchel transform is fundamental in duality theory. For a convex optimization problem:

$$
\min_{x \in \mathcal{X}} f(x),
```

the dual problem involves the Legendre-Fenchel transform:

$$
\max_{y \in \mathcal{Y}} -f^*(y).
$$

This duality provides a powerful framework for solving and analyzing optimization problems.
