Hecke Eigensheaves


**ASSISTANT**

Hecke eigensheaves are a fundamental concept in the Geometric Langlands Program, analogous to eigenfunctions in classical harmonic analysis but situated in the context of algebraic geometry and $\mathcal{D}$-modules. To understand Hecke eigensheaves, we need to delve into the concepts of Hecke operators, $\mathcal{D}$-modules, and the moduli stack of $G$-bundles.

### Hecke Operators in the Geometric Context

In the classical setting, Hecke operators act on spaces of automorphic forms. Geometrically, these operators can be described using correspondences on the moduli space of $G$-bundles. Let $X$ be a smooth projective curve over a field $k$, and let $G$ be a reductive algebraic group.

The moduli stack $\text{Bun}_G(X)$ parametrizes $G$-bundles on $X$. A Hecke operator $H_x^V$ associated with a point $x \in X$ and a representation $V$ of $^L G$, the Langlands dual group of $G$, acts on $\mathcal{D}$-modules on $\text{Bun}_G(X)$. This action can be described in terms of modifications of $G$-bundles at the point $x$.

### $\mathcal{D}$-modules and Hecke Eigensheaves

A $\mathcal{D}$-module on $\text{Bun}_G(X)$ is a sheaf equipped with an action of differential operators, encoding geometric data that can be related to automorphic forms. A Hecke eigensheaf is a special kind of $\mathcal{D}$-module that transforms in a specific way under the action of Hecke operators.

Formally, let $\mathcal{F}$ be a $\mathcal{D}$-module on $\text{Bun}_G(X)$. $\mathcal{F}$ is called a Hecke eigensheaf with eigenvalue $\mathcal{E}$, where $\mathcal{E}$ is a local system on $X$ with structure group $^L G$, if for every point $x \in X$ and every representation $V$ of $^L G$, the following condition holds:
$$
H_x^V(\mathcal{F}) \simeq \mathcal{E}_x \otimes V \otimes \mathcal{F},
$$
where $H_x^V(\mathcal{F})$ denotes the action of the Hecke operator at $x$ with representation $V$ on the $\mathcal{D}$-module $\mathcal{F}$, and $\mathcal{E}_x$ is the fiber of the local system $\mathcal{E}$ at $x$.

### Construction and Properties

The construction of Hecke eigensheaves involves sophisticated tools from algebraic geometry and representation theory, including the use of geometric correspondences and moduli spaces.

1. **Moduli Stack $\text{Bun}_G(X)$**: This is the moduli space of $G$-bundles over $X$. It is a key object in the study of Hecke eigensheaves.
2. **Hecke Correspondence**: For a point $x \in X$ and a representation $V$ of $^L G$, the Hecke correspondence defines a modification of $G$-bundles at $x$, leading to the action of Hecke operators on $\mathcal{D}$-modules.
3. **Eigenvalue Local System**: The local system $\mathcal{E}$ on $X$ acts as the eigenvalue for the Hecke eigensheaf. This local system corresponds to a $^L G$-local system, reflecting the deep connection between geometric objects and representation theory.

### Example: $G = GL_n$

For $G = GL_n$, the moduli stack $\text{Bun}_{GL_n}(X)$ parametrizes vector bundles of rank $n$ over $X$. In this case, the Hecke eigensheaves can be studied concretely in terms of modifications of vector bundles. A $\mathcal{D}$-module $\mathcal{F}$ on $\text{Bun}_{GL_n}(X)$ is a Hecke eigensheaf with eigenvalue $\mathcal{E}$ if the action of Hecke operators corresponds to tensoring with the appropriate local system $\mathcal{E}$.

### Connections and Applications

Hecke eigensheaves are deeply connected to various areas of mathematics and theoretical physics. They provide a geometric realization of automorphic forms and have applications in the study of moduli spaces, representation theory, and quantum field theory. For instance, in the context of the [[Geometric Langlands Conjecture]], Hecke eigensheaves serve as the geometric analogs of automorphic representations, linking the geometry of moduli spaces with the representation theory of Galois groups and algebraic groups.

Understanding Hecke eigensheaves requires a solid foundation in algebraic geometry, $\mathcal{D}$-modules, and the theory of local systems. Their study continues to be an active and rich area of research, with ongoing developments and deep connections to other areas of mathematics.
