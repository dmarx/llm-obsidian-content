Physics of Living Systems @ MIT


**ASSISTANT**

The **Physics of Living Systems (PoLS)** group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is an interdisciplinary research community that applies principles of physics to understand the complex behaviors of living organisms. This group aims to uncover the fundamental physical principles that underlie biological processes and systems, ranging from molecular to organismal scales.

### Key Research Areas

1. **Mechanobiology**:
   - Study of how mechanical forces influence biological processes.
   - Investigation of cellular mechanics, tissue dynamics, and the mechanical properties of biomolecules.
   - Example: Understanding how cells sense and respond to mechanical stimuli in their environment.

2. **Systems Biology**:
   - Exploration of how biological components interact to form complex networks and systems.
   - Use of mathematical and computational models to study gene regulation, signal transduction, and metabolic pathways.
   - Example: Modeling the dynamics of genetic regulatory networks to understand cellular decision-making.

3. **Biophysics of the Cytoskeleton**:
   - Analysis of the structure and dynamics of the cytoskeleton, a network of protein filaments that provides mechanical support and drives cell motility.
   - Study of molecular motors and their role in cellular transport and organization.
   - Example: Investigating how motor proteins like kinesin and dynein move along microtubules to transport cellular cargo.

4. **Evolutionary Dynamics**:
   - Examination of the physical and mathematical principles governing evolutionary processes.
   - Study of how genetic variations spread and are maintained in populations.
   - Example: Using [[evolutionary game theory]] to model the evolution of cooperation and competition in microbial communities.

5. **Neuroscience and Brain Dynamics**:
   - Investigation of the physical principles underlying neural activity and brain function.
   - Study of neural coding, network dynamics, and brain-computer interfaces.
   - Example: Analyzing how neural circuits process information and generate behavior.

6. **Synthetic Biology**:
   - Engineering of biological systems using principles from physics and engineering.
   - Design and construction of synthetic gene circuits and cellular machines.
   - Example: Creating synthetic biosensors that can detect and respond to environmental changes.

### Research Techniques

- **Single-Molecule Techniques**:
  - Methods like optical tweezers and atomic force microscopy to study the mechanics of individual biomolecules.
  - Example: Measuring the forces generated by motor proteins as they move along cytoskeletal filaments.

- **Fluorescence Microscopy**:
  - Use of advanced imaging techniques to visualize the dynamics of biological processes in living cells.
  - Example: Tracking the movement of fluorescently labeled molecules within a cell to study intracellular transport.

- **Mathematical and Computational Modeling**:
  - Development of models to simulate and analyze complex biological systems.
  - Example: Using agent-based models to study the behavior of interacting cells in a tissue.

- **Genomic and Proteomic Analysis**:
  - High-throughput techniques to study the expression and interaction of genes and proteins.
  - Example: Using RNA sequencing to analyze gene expression patterns in response to mechanical stress.

### Notable Researchers

- **Jeff Gore**:
  - Focuses on experimental evolution and the dynamics of microbial populations.
