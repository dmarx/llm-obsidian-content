### Viability Theory

**Viability Theory** is a mathematical framework for analyzing the dynamics of systems evolving under constraints. The primary goal is to determine conditions under which a system can maintain its state within a predefined set of viable states over time. This theory is widely used in fields such as [[control theory]], [[ecology]], economics, and [[systems theory]], where systems must adapt to uncertain environments while satisfying constraints.

Viability theory was developed by [[Jean-Pierre Aubin]] in the 1980s and has since become a key tool for studying adaptive and sustainable behaviors in complex systems.

### Core Concepts of Viability Theory

#### 1. **Viable States**
A state is considered **viable** if it satisfies a set of constraints (e.g., physical, biological, economic) at a given time. The system's goal is to remain within the **viability domain**—the set of all viable states—while evolving over time.

#### 2. **Control Dynamics**
A system evolves according to controlled differential (or difference) equations:
$$
\dot{\mathbf{x}} = f(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{u}),
$$
where:
- \( \mathbf{x} \) is the system state.
- \( \mathbf{u} \) is the control input.
- \( f \) defines the dynamics of the system.

The system is viable if there exists a control \( \mathbf{u} \) such that \( \mathbf{x}(t) \in K \) for all \( t \), where \( K \) is the viability domain.

#### 3. **Viability Domain**
The viability domain is the subset of the state space where the system can operate while satisfying its constraints:
$$
K = \{ \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n : g(\mathbf{x}) \leq 0 \},
$$
where \( g(\mathbf{x}) \) represents the constraints.

#### 4. **Capturability**
A system is said to be **capturable** if, starting from a state outside the viability domain, it can be steered into the domain within a finite time using appropriate controls.

### Key Results in Viability Theory

#### 1. **Viability Kernel**
The **viability kernel** is the largest subset of the viability domain where the system can remain indefinitely while satisfying the constraints. Formally:
$$
\mathcal{V}(K) = \{ \mathbf{x}_0 \in K : \exists \mathbf{u}(t) \text{ such that } \mathbf{x}(t) \in K, \, \forall t \geq 0 \}.
$$

#### 2. **Regulation Map**
The regulation map provides the set of controls \( \mathbf{u} \) that ensure the system stays within the viability domain:
$$
\mathcal{U}(\mathbf{x}) = \{ \mathbf{u} : \dot{\mathbf{x}} = f(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{u}), \, \mathbf{x} \in K \}.
$$

#### 3. **Boundary Dynamics**
The behavior of the system near the boundary of the viability domain is crucial for determining its resilience. Systems close to the boundary require precise control to avoid leaving the domain.

### Applications of Viability Theory

#### 1. **Ecology**
- Viability theory models population dynamics under resource constraints, environmental changes, and predator-prey interactions.
- Example: Determining sustainable harvesting strategies that maintain species populations within viable levels.

#### 2. **Economics**
- Used to study economic systems under constraints like resource availability, labor supply, or fiscal policies.
- Example: Identifying viable economic policies that maintain growth without exceeding debt limits.

#### 3. **Engineering and Control Systems**
- Viability theory provides a framework for designing control systems that ensure safety and functionality.
- Example: Autonomous vehicles operating within safe regions of state-space (e.g., speed and position).

#### 4. **Climate and Sustainability**
- Models the conditions under which ecosystems or societies can sustain themselves in the face of climate change or resource depletion.
- Example: Determining the viable levels of carbon emissions to avoid tipping points.

### Mathematical Tools in Viability Theory

#### Differential Inclusions
Viability problems often involve **differential inclusions**, which generalize differential equations by allowing multiple possible trajectories:
$$
\dot{\mathbf{x}} \in F(\mathbf{x}),
$$
where \( F(\mathbf{x}) \) is a set-valued map.

#### Dynamic Programming and Set-Valued Analysis
Dynamic programming techniques are used to compute viability kernels and optimal controls. [[Set-valued analysis]] helps in handling the multi-valued nature of \( F(\mathbf{x}) \).

### Challenges and Extensions

1. **Uncertainty and Stochastic Dynamics**
Viability theory has been extended to stochastic systems, where the dynamics include randomness:
$$
d\mathbf{x} = f(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{u}) \, dt + \sigma(\mathbf{x}) \, dW_t,
$$
where \( W_t \) is a Wiener process representing noise.

2. **Computational Complexity**
The computation of viability kernels and regulation maps for high-dimensional systems can be computationally expensive, requiring numerical approximations.

3. **Applications to Complex Systems**
Viability theory is being applied to emerging areas like [[complex adaptive systems]] and multi-agent systems, where interactions between components add layers of complexity.
