**ASSISTANT**

Indeed, the key intuition behind the method of Lagrange multipliers is exactly as you've described: at the points of extrema, subject to a constraint, the gradient of the objective function must be aligned with the gradient of the constraint function. This alignment is crucial because it signifies that any small movement from this point along the surface defined by the constraint does not yield a first-order change in the value of the objective function, given that all feasible directions of movement are tangent to the constraint surface.

### Geometric Interpretation

To further unpack this concept, let's consider the geometric interpretation. The gradient of a function at any point is a vector pointing in the direction of the steepest increase of that function. For an objective function $f(\mathbf{x})$ constrained by $g(\mathbf{x}) = 0$, the gradient $\nabla g(\mathbf{x})$ at any point on the constraint surface is normal (perpendicular) to the surface at that point.

When we state that the gradients of $f$ and $g$ must be aligned, we mean that there exists a scalar $\lambda$ (the Lagrange multiplier) such that:
$$ \nabla f(\mathbf{x}) = \lambda \nabla g(\mathbf{x}) $$
This equation tells us that at the extremum, the gradient of the objective function is also normal to the constraint surface, just like the gradient of the constraint function. Hence, $\nabla f(\mathbf{x})$ must be parallel to $\nabla g(\mathbf{x})$. This alignment implies that any permissible movement away from this extremum (while still adhering to the constraint) does not lead to a change in $f$ to first order, because such movement must occur along the constraint surface, where the gradient of $f$ offers no component.

### Implications in Optimization

In practical optimization problems, this relationship is used to locate points that may be candidates for local maxima or minima under the constraints. Solving the system of equations given by the gradients and the constraint equation(s) yields critical points. Each of these points then needs to be tested, often using second-order conditions or numerical evaluation, to determine whether it is indeed a maximum, minimum, or saddle point.

### Example Revisited

For an illustrative example, consider again the function $f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2$ with the constraint $g(x, y) = x + y - 1 = 0$. The gradients are:
$$ \nabla f(x, y) = \begin{bmatrix} 2x \\ 2y \end{bmatrix}, \quad \nabla g(x, y) = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} $$
At the extremum under this constraint, these gradients align:
$$ \begin{bmatrix} 2x \\ 2y \end{bmatrix} = \lambda \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} $$
Solving this alongside the constraint equation $x + y = 1$ reveals that $\lambda = 2x = 2y$ and $x = y = 0.5$.

This concept not only solves the practical problem but also beautifully illustrates the abstract mathematical principle of optimality under constraints, linking geometric intuition with analytical rigor.
