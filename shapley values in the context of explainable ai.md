### Shapley Values in the Context of Explainable AI

The concept of Shapley values has been extended from [[cooperative game theory]] to the field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). In this context, Shapley values are used to attribute the output of a machine learning model to its input features, providing insights into the model’s decision-making process.

#### Background

Machine learning models, particularly complex ones like deep neural networks, are often considered "black boxes" due to their lack of transparency in how they arrive at decisions. To address this, explainable AI aims to make these models more interpretable. Shapley values provide a mathematically grounded method to attribute a model’s prediction to its features, ensuring that each feature’s contribution is fairly evaluated.

#### Definition in XAI

Given a machine learning model $f$ and an instance $x = (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)$, the goal is to explain the prediction $f(x)$ by distributing it among the input features $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$. The Shapley value $\phi_i$ for feature $i$ is defined as:

$$
\phi_i = \sum_{S \subseteq N \setminus \{i\}} \frac{|S|!(|N| - |S| - 1)!}{|N|!} \left( f(S \cup \{i\}) - f(S) \right)
$$

Here, $N$ is the set of all features, $S$ is a subset of features excluding $i$, $f(S)$ represents the prediction of the model when only the features in $S$ are considered, and $f(S \cup \{i\})$ represents the prediction when feature $i$ is added to $S$.

#### Properties

The Shapley values in XAI inherit the properties from [[cooperative game theory]]:

1. **Efficiency**:
   $$ \sum_{i \in N} \phi_i = f(x) - E[f(x)], $$
   where $E[f(x)]$ is the expected prediction over all possible feature values.

2. **Symmetry**:
   If two features contribute equally to all possible coalitions, their Shapley values will be the same.

3. **Dummy Player**:
   If a feature does not change the prediction regardless of the other features, its Shapley value is zero.

4. **Additivity**:
   For two models $f$ and $g$, the Shapley value of their sum is the sum of their Shapley values.

#### Computation

Computing Shapley values directly can be computationally expensive because it involves evaluating the model on all possible subsets of features. However, several approximation methods and algorithms have been developed to make this feasible in practice:

1. **Monte Carlo Sampling**:
   Randomly sample subsets of features to approximate the Shapley values.

2. **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**:
   A popular framework that uses efficient algorithms to compute approximate Shapley values, tailored to different types of models (e.g., tree-based models, deep learning models).

#### Example

Consider a simple linear regression model:
$$ f(x) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_3 x_3 $$

For an instance $x = (x_1, x_2, x_3)$, the Shapley value for each feature can be calculated by considering the marginal contributions of each feature to every possible subset of features.

If $\beta_0 = 0$, $\beta_1 = 2$, $\beta_2 = 3$, and $\beta_3 = 4$, and for $x = (1, 2, 3)$:
$$ f(x) = 2 \cdot 1 + 3 \cdot 2 + 4 \cdot 3 = 2 + 6 + 12 = 20 $$

The Shapley value for each feature is derived from evaluating the model on subsets of features, considering the permutations and contributions.

#### Applications

1. **Feature Importance**:
   Shapley values provide a robust measure of feature importance, helping to understand which features most influence the model’s predictions.

2. **Model Debugging**:
   By identifying features with unexpected contributions, developers can debug and improve the model.

3. **Transparency and Trust**:
   Providing clear explanations based on Shapley values enhances the transparency of AI systems, building trust among users and stakeholders.

4. **Fairness and Bias Detection**:
   Shapley values can help detect biases by showing how sensitive the model’s predictions are to certain features, which can be crucial for ensuring fairness.
