**USER**

MoSCoW method


**ASSISTANT**

The **MoSCoW method** is a prioritization framework widely used in project management and business analysis, particularly within [[Agile Development|Agile]] and [[Lean Software Development|Lean]] methodologies. It is designed to categorize and prioritize requirements by importance and urgency, ensuring that limited time and resources are allocated efficiently to achieve business objectives. The acronym **MoSCoW** stands for four priority categories:

---

### Priority Categories
1. **Must Have**  
   - Represents non-negotiable requirements that are essential for project success.  
   - Failure to deliver these requirements will result in project failure or a product that is not fit for use.  

   #### Examples:  
   - Legal or regulatory requirements.  
   - Core functionality without which the system cannot operate.  

   #### Formalization:
   Given a set of requirements \( R = \{r_1, r_2, \dots, r_n\} \), let \( R_m \subset R \) denote the "Must Have" requirements. A project success condition can be expressed as:  
   \[
   \text{Project Success} \iff \forall r \in R_m, \; r \text{ is delivered.}
   \]

2. **Should Have**  
   - Important but not essential requirements.  
   - These features have a significant impact on user experience or business value but can be postponed if time or resources run out.  

   #### Examples:  
   - Improved user experience features.  
   - Secondary features that enhance functionality but are not mission-critical.  

   #### Trade-offs:
   When time or budget is constrained, some \( R_s \subset R \) from the "Should Have" set may be deferred or moved to a later development phase without compromising the overall success of the project.

3. **Could Have**  
   - Desirable but non-essential requirements.  
   - These features are usually low-impact and do not contribute significantly to the core functionality.  

   #### Examples:  
   - Additional aesthetic enhancements.  
   - Minor usability improvements.  

   #### Relationship:  
   \[
   R_c \subset R \quad \text{where} \quad R_c \text{ has the least impact on critical objectives.}
   \]
   These features are candidates for removal if resources are limited or deadlines become unachievable.

4. **Wonâ€™t Have (this time)**  
   - Requirements that have been explicitly excluded from the current project scope.  
   - These may be considered for future development or rejected altogether.  

   #### Examples:  
   - Features requested but deemed out of scope for the project.  
   - Potential future improvements not required by stakeholders in the current iteration.  

   #### Scope exclusion condition:  
   \[
   R_w = R \setminus (R_m \cup R_s \cup R_c)
   \]

### Process
The MoSCoW method is typically performed in collaboration with stakeholders to define and classify each requirement in context. Requirements are discussed and categorized based on business needs, risks, and resource availability.  

1. Identify and document all requirements.  
2. Classify each requirement using the MoSCoW categories.  
3. Assign priorities based on stakeholder input and business impact.  
4. Regularly revisit and revise the prioritization as the project evolves.

### Comparison with Weighted Scoring Models
Unlike weighted scoring models, which assign numerical values to rank requirements based on multiple criteria, the MoSCoW method is a qualitative approach. Its simplicity makes it practical for rapid prioritization but may lead to ambiguity when stakeholders disagree on classifications.
