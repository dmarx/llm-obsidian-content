laurent series


**ASSISTANT**

The Laurent series is a representation of a complex function as a series, which extends the concept of the Taylor series to include terms with negative powers. This is particularly useful for studying functions with singularities. The Laurent series can converge in an annulus (a ring-shaped region) in the complex plane, rather than just a disk.

### Definition

For a function \( f(z) \) that is analytic in an annulus \( A = \{ z \in \mathbb{C} \mid R_1 < |z - z_0| < R_2 \} \) around a point \( z_0 \), the Laurent series expansion of \( f(z) \) is given by:

$$
f(z) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} a_n (z - z_0)^n
$$

where \( a_n \) are complex coefficients.

### Finding Laurent Series

The coefficients \( a_n \) in the Laurent series can be found using the contour integrals:

$$
a_n = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_\gamma \frac{f(\zeta)}{(\zeta - z_0)^{n+1}} \, d\zeta
$$

where \( \gamma \) is a positively oriented, simple closed contour within the annulus of convergence.

### Types of Singularities

The nature of the Laurent series depends on the type of singularity at \( z_0 \):

1. **Removable Singularity**: If \( f(z) \) has a removable singularity at \( z_0 \), the Laurent series has no terms with negative powers (i.e., it reduces to a Taylor series).

2. **Pole**: If \( f(z) \) has a pole of order \( m \) at \( z_0 \), the Laurent series has a finite number of terms with negative powers, specifically from \( (z - z_0)^{-m} \) to \( (z - z_0)^{-1} \).

3. **Essential Singularity**: If \( f(z) \) has an essential singularity at \( z_0 \), the Laurent series contains an infinite number of terms with negative powers.

### Examples

#### Example 1: Simple Pole

Consider the function \( f(z) = \frac{1}{z-1} \). We want to find its Laurent series expansion around \( z_0 = 0 \).

1. **Rewrite the function**:
   $$
   f(z) = \frac{1}{z-1} = -\frac{1}{1 - z} = -\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} z^n
   $$

   This is valid for \( |z| < 1 \).

2. **Laurent series**:
   $$
   f(z) = -\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} z^n = -1 - z - z^2 - z^3 - \cdots
   $$

#### Example 2: Function with an Essential Singularity

Consider the function \( f(z) = e^{1/z} \). We want to find its Laurent series expansion around \( z_0 = 0 \).

1. **Rewrite the function** using the series expansion for the exponential function:
   $$
   f(z) = e^{1/z} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n!} \left( \frac{1}{z} \right)^n = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n!} z^{-n}
   $$

2. **Laurent series**:
   $$
   f(z) = 1 + \frac{1}{z} + \frac{1}{2!} \frac{1}{z^2} + \frac{1}{3!} \frac{1}{z^3} + \cdots = 1 + \frac{1}{z} + \frac{1}{2z^2} + \frac{1}{6z^3} + \cdots
   $$

### Applications

1. **Analyzing Singularities**: Laurent series help in understanding the nature of singularities of complex functions and classifying them as removable, poles, or essential.

2. **Residue Calculation**: Laurent series are instrumental in computing residues, which are crucial for evaluating complex integrals using the Residue Theorem.

3. **Complex Integration**: Laurent series allow the evaluation of contour integrals in regions that include singularities, making them a powerful tool in complex integration.

4. **Solving Differential Equations**: Series solutions of differential equations in the complex plane often involve Laurent series.

### Example of Laurent Series in Practice

Evaluate the integral:
$$
\oint_{|z|=2} \frac{z^2 + 1}{z(z-1)} \, dz
$$

**Solution**:
1. **Identify the singularities**: The function \( \frac{z^2 + 1}{z(z-1)} \) has singularities at \( z = 0 \) and \( z = 1 \).

2. **Laurent series expansion around \( z = 0 \)**:
   $$
   \frac{z^2 + 1}{z(z-1)} = \frac{1 + z^2}{z(z-1)} = \frac{1 + z^2}{z} \cdot \frac{1}{z-1} = \frac{1}{z} \cdot \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{z}} = \frac{1}{z} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \left(\frac{1}{z}\right)^n
   $$
   For \( |z| > 1 \), we have:
   $$
   \frac{1}{z(z-1)} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{z^{n+1}} = \frac{1}{z} + \frac{1}{z^2} + \frac{1}{z^3} + \cdots
   $$
   Thus,
   $$
   \frac{z^2 + 1}{z(z-1)} = \frac{1}{z} + \frac{1}{z^2} + \frac{1}{z^3} + \cdots + z + \frac{1}{z^2} + \frac{z^2}{z^3} + \cdots
   $$

3. **Residues**:
   - At \( z = 0 \):
     $$
     \text{Res}\left(\frac{z^2 + 1}{z(z-1)}, 0\right) = 1
     $$
   - At \( z = 1 \):
     $$
     \text{Res}\left(\frac{z^2 + 1}{z(z-1)}, 1\right) = \lim_{z \to 1} (z-1)\frac{z^2 + 1}{z(z-1)} = \lim_{z \to 1} \frac{z^2 + 1}{z} = 2
     $$

4. **Apply the Residue Theorem**:
   $$
   \oint_{|z|=2} \frac{z^2 + 1}{z(z-1)} \, dz = 2\pi i \left( 1 + 2 \right) = 6\pi i
   $$
