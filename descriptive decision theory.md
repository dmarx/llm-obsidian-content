Descriptive Decision Theory


**ASSISTANT**

Descriptive [[decision theory]] examines how people actually make decisions, including the psychological, social, and cognitive processes involved. Unlike normative [[decision theory]], which prescribes how decisions should be made to be rational, descriptive [[decision theory]] aims to understand and predict real-world decision-making behaviors.

## Key Concepts in Descriptive Decision Theory

### 1. Bounded Rationality
Herbert Simon introduced the concept of bounded rationality, which suggests that individuals make decisions within the constraints of limited information, cognitive limitations, and time constraints. Rather than optimizing, they "satisfice," or seek a solution that is good enough.

### 2. Heuristics and Biases
Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman identified various heuristics (mental shortcuts) and biases that people use to make decisions. These heuristics simplify decision-making but can lead to systematic errors.

### 3. Prospect Theory
Developed by Kahneman and Tversky, prospect theory describes how people choose between probabilistic alternatives that involve risk, where the probabilities of outcomes are known. It highlights how people value gains and losses differently, leading to behaviors like loss aversion.

### 4. Loss Aversion
Loss aversion is the tendency for people to prefer avoiding losses rather than acquiring equivalent gains. For example, losing $100 feels more painful than gaining $100 feels pleasurable.

### 5. Framing Effects
The way information is presented (or "framed") can significantly affect decisions. For example, people may react differently to a treatment that is described as having a 90% survival rate versus a 10% mortality rate.

### 6. Anchoring
Anchoring involves relying too heavily on the first piece of information encountered (the "anchor") when making decisions. Subsequent judgments are often influenced by this initial information.

### 7. Overconfidence
People often overestimate their knowledge, abilities, and the accuracy of their predictions, leading to overconfident decisions.

## Heuristics and Biases in Decision Making

### Availability Heuristic
People judge the likelihood of an event based on how easily examples come to mind. For example, after hearing about airplane accidents, a person might overestimate the risk of flying.

### Representativeness Heuristic
People assess the probability of an event based on how similar it is to a typical case. This can lead to neglecting relevant statistical information, such as base rates.

### Confirmation Bias
People tend to search for, interpret, and remember information that confirms their preconceptions, while ignoring or undervaluing evidence that contradicts them.

## Prospect Theory

Prospect theory is a descriptive model that explains deviations from expected utility theory. It consists of two main components:

### Value Function
The value function in prospect theory is:
- **S-shaped**: Concave for gains, convex for losses, reflecting diminishing sensitivity.
- **Losses loom larger than gains**: The value function is steeper for losses than for gains, illustrating loss aversion.

### Decision Weighting
Prospect theory introduces decision weights that are not linear probabilities. People tend to overweight small probabilities and underweight large probabilities, leading to risk-seeking behavior in low-probability gains and risk-averse behavior in low-probability losses.

### Example: Lottery and Insurance
- **Lottery**: People buy lottery tickets despite low probabilities of winning, due to overweighting of the small chance of a large gain.
- **Insurance**: People buy insurance to avoid large potential losses, due to overweighting of the small chance of a significant loss.

## Applications of Descriptive Decision Theory

### Behavioral Economics
Descriptive [[decision theory]] is foundational to behavioral economics, which studies how psychological factors affect economic decisions. It informs policies and interventions that account for actual human behavior rather than idealized rational behavior.

### Marketing and Consumer Behavior
Understanding heuristics and biases helps marketers design strategies that influence consumer decisions. For example, framing effects can be used in advertising to highlight positive aspects of a product.

### Public Policy
Policymakers use insights from descriptive [[decision theory]] to design better regulations and interventions. For instance, nudging involves subtly guiding choices through changes in the way options are presented, without restricting freedom of choice.

### Health Decisions
In healthcare, descriptive [[decision theory]] helps in understanding how patients make choices about treatments, prevention, and health behaviors. Framing information about risks and benefits can significantly impact patient decisions.

### Organizational Behavior
Descriptive [[decision theory]] is applied in organizational settings to improve decision-making processes, reduce biases, and enhance strategic planning. Training programs can help employees recognize and mitigate cognitive biases.

## Limitations and Challenges

### Complexity of Human Behavior
Human decision-making is influenced by a complex interplay of cognitive, emotional, and social factors, making it difficult to capture all relevant variables in descriptive models.

### Context-Dependence
Heuristics and biases can vary widely depending on the context and individual differences. What works in one situation might not apply in another, challenging the generalizability of findings.

### Ethical Considerations
Using insights from descriptive [[decision theory]], such as nudging, raises ethical questions about manipulation and autonomy. Policymakers and marketers must balance effectiveness with respect for individual choice.

## Conclusion

Descriptive [[decision theory]] provides a nuanced understanding of how people actually make decisions, incorporating psychological, cognitive, and social factors. By highlighting heuristics, biases, and the ways people deviate from rationality, it offers valuable insights for various fields, including economics, marketing, public policy, and healthcare. Recognizing these patterns of behavior helps design better interventions, improve decision-making processes, and create policies that align more closely with human behavior.
