Symmetry-Induced Degeneracy


**ASSISTANT**

Symmetry-induced degeneracy arises when the eigenvalues of an operator in a physical system are degenerate due to the presence of underlying symmetries. Such symmetries constrain the form of the Hamiltonian or other relevant operators, leading to multiple states sharing the same eigenvalue. These degeneracies are robust against perturbations that respect the symmetry but can be lifted if the symmetry is broken.

### Key Concepts

1. **Symmetry Operators**:
   Symmetry operators commute with the Hamiltonian of the system. If \( \hat{S} \) is a symmetry operator and \( \hat{H} \) is the Hamiltonian, then:
   $$
   [\hat{H}, \hat{S}] = 0
   $$
   This commutation relation implies that \( \hat{H} \) and \( \hat{S} \) can be simultaneously diagonalized, and the eigenstates of \( \hat{H} \) can be chosen to be eigenstates of \( \hat{S} \).

2. **Degeneracy from Group Theory**:
   The degeneracies can often be understood in terms of group representations. For example, in a system with rotational symmetry, the Hamiltonian is invariant under rotations, and the eigenstates can be classified according to the irreducible representations of the rotation group.

### Mathematical Formalism

Consider a Hamiltonian \( \hat{H} \) with a set of symmetry operators \( \{ \hat{S}_i \} \). If \( \hat{H} \) is invariant under these symmetries, we have:
$$
[\hat{H}, \hat{S}_i] = 0 \quad \forall \, i
$$

The eigenstates of \( \hat{H} \) can be grouped into multiplets corresponding to the irreducible representations of the symmetry group. Each multiplet has a degenerate eigenvalue associated with it.

### Example: Hydrogen Atom

The hydrogen atom provides a classic example of symmetry-induced degeneracy. The Hamiltonian for the hydrogen atom is given by:
$$
\hat{H} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 - \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r}
$$

The Hamiltonian is spherically symmetric, meaning it is invariant under rotations. The symmetry group here is the rotation group \( SO(3) \). The eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, the hydrogen atom wavefunctions, can be labeled by the quantum numbers \( n \) (principal), \( l \) (orbital angular momentum), and \( m \) (magnetic).

The energy eigenvalues depend only on the principal quantum number \( n \):
$$
E_n = -\frac{13.6 \, \text{eV}}{n^2}
$$

For each \( n \), there is an \((n^2)\)-fold degeneracy. This degeneracy arises because the states with different \( l \) and \( m \) but the same \( n \) have the same energy. The degeneracy is a consequence of the rotational symmetry of the Coulomb potential.

### Example: Crystalline Solids

In crystalline solids, the electronic band structure often exhibits degeneracies at high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone due to the crystal symmetries. For example, at the \(\Gamma\) point, which is a high-symmetry point, the symmetry of the crystal can lead to degenerate electronic states. Group theory and representation theory of the space group can be used to predict and understand these degeneracies.

### Degeneracy Lifting

If a perturbation breaks the symmetry, the degeneracy can be lifted. For instance, in the hydrogen atom, applying an external magnetic field (Zeeman effect) or an electric field (Stark effect) can split the degenerate energy levels:
- **Zeeman Effect**:
  In the presence of a magnetic field \( \mathbf{B} \), the Hamiltonian acquires an additional term:
  $$
  \hat{H}_Z = -\gamma \mathbf{B} \cdot \mathbf{S}
  $$
  This term breaks the rotational symmetry, lifting the degeneracy of the \( m \) states.
- **Stark Effect**:
  An external electric field \( \mathbf{E} \) adds a perturbation:
  $$
  \hat{H}_S = -e \mathbf{E} \cdot \mathbf{r}
  $$
  This breaks the spherical symmetry, leading to the splitting of degenerate states.

### Conclusion

Symmetry-induced degeneracy is a fundamental concept that reveals how symmetries in physical systems lead to degenerate eigenvalues. This phenomenon is pivotal in understanding various physical systems, from atomic spectra to electronic properties of materials. By employing group theory and representation theory, one can predict and analyze these degeneracies, gaining deeper insights into the underlying physics and potential applications in technology and materials science.
