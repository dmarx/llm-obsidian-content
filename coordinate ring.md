The concept of the coordinate ring is central in algebraic geometry as it provides an algebraic framework for studying the properties of algebraic varieties. The coordinate ring enables a translation of geometric questions about the variety into algebraic questions about rings and ideals, making it a powerful tool in the discipline.

### Definition of Coordinate Ring

For an affine variety \( V \) defined in an affine space \( \mathbb{A}^n(k) \) over a field \( k \) (typically an algebraically closed field like \( \mathbb{C} \)), the coordinate ring \( A(V) \) of \( V \) is defined as the ring of polynomial functions on \( V \). Algebraically, it is constructed as follows:

$$
A(V) = k[x_1, \ldots, x_n] / I(V)
$$

where \( k[x_1, \ldots, x_n] \) is the polynomial ring in \( n \) variables over \( k \), and \( I(V) \) is the ideal of all polynomials that vanish on every point of \( V \). This ideal is known as the vanishing ideal of \( V \).

### Properties of the Coordinate Ring

1. **Function Representation**: Elements of \( A(V) \) can be thought of as polynomial functions on \( V \), where two polynomials represent the same function if their difference lies in \( I(V) \).

2. **Algebraic Structure**: \( A(V) \) is a \( k \)-algebra. It inherits operations of addition and multiplication from the polynomial ring \( k[x_1, \ldots, x_n] \). Its structure as a ring reflects and encodes the geometric properties of \( V \).

3. **Reduced Ring**: If \( V \) is an irreducible variety (i.e., it cannot be written as a union of two proper subvarieties), then \( A(V) \) is an integral domain. This is because \( I(V) \) is a prime ideal in this case. If \( V \) is not irreducible, \( A(V) \) is still a reduced ring (no nilpotent elements) provided \( V \) is reduced (i.e., has no embedded components or multiple structures at any point).

4. **Dimension Correspondence**: The Krull dimension of \( A(V) \), which is the maximum length of chains of prime ideals, equals the dimension of the variety \( V \). This links algebraic properties directly to geometric intuition.

### Examples of Coordinate Rings

1. **The Line**: For the affine line \( \mathbb{A}^1(k) \), the coordinate ring is simply \( k[x] \), the ring of all polynomials in one variable over \( k \).

2. **The Circle**: Consider the circle defined by \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \) in \( \mathbb{A}^2(\mathbb{R}) \). The coordinate ring is \( \mathbb{R}[x, y]/(x^2 + y^2 - 1) \). Here, \( (x^2 + y^2 - 1) \) represents the ideal of all polynomials that vanish on the circle.

3. **A Cubic Curve**: For the cubic curve \( y^2 = x^3 - x \) in \( \mathbb{A}^2(k) \), the coordinate ring is \( k[x, y]/(y^2 - x^3 + x) \). This ring helps explore properties like points of inflection, tangents, and the behavior near singular points (if any).

### Applications

- **Algebraic Study**: The coordinate ring facilitates the study of algebraic properties like factorization, field extensions, and module theory, directly reflecting geometric phenomena such as tangency, intersection, and covering spaces.
- **Computational Algebraic Geometry**: Tools like Grobner bases and computational software use the coordinate ring to compute intersections, decompositions, and other properties of varieties effectively.

In conclusion, the coordinate ring provides a bridge between algebra and geometry, offering a method to handle geometric objects with algebraic techniques. This connection not only enriches the understanding of geometric objects but also enhances the capability to manipulate and study these objects rigorously.
