Choked Flow

### Choked Flow

**Choked flow** is a phenomenon in fluid dynamics that occurs when the flow rate of a compressible fluid (such as gas or steam) through a conduit, such as a nozzle or a vent, reaches a maximum limit. At this point, further decreases in downstream pressure do not increase the flow rate. This happens when the flow velocity reaches the local speed of sound at the narrowest part of the conduit, often referred to as the **throat** in the context of nozzles.

### Key Concepts

1. **Mach Number**:
   - The Mach number \( M \) is the ratio of the flow velocity \( u \) to the local speed of sound \( a \):
     $$
     M = \frac{u}{a}.
     $$
   - **Choked flow** occurs when the Mach number at the throat reaches \( M = 1 \), meaning the flow velocity equals the speed of sound.

2. **Critical Pressure Ratio**:
   - The flow becomes choked when the downstream pressure \( p_2 \) drops below a critical value relative to the upstream pressure \( p_1 \). The critical pressure ratio for a perfect gas is given by:
     $$
     \left(\frac{p_2}{p_1}\right)_{\text{crit}} = \left(\frac{2}{\gamma + 1}\right)^{\frac{\gamma}{\gamma - 1}},
     $$
     where \( \gamma \) is the ratio of specific heats ([[adiabatic index]]).

3. **Mass Flow Rate**:
   - The mass flow rate \( \dot{m} \) through a nozzle or orifice under choked conditions is maximized and becomes independent of the downstream pressure:
     $$
     \dot{m} = C_d A^* p_1 \sqrt{\frac{\gamma}{R T_1}} \left(\frac{2}{\gamma + 1}\right)^{\frac{\gamma + 1}{2(\gamma - 1)}},
     $$
     where:
     - \( C_d \) is the discharge coefficient.
     - \( A^* \) is the throat area.
     - \( R \) is the specific gas constant.
     - \( T_1 \) is the stagnation temperature.

4. **Isentropic Flow**:
   - The flow leading up to the point of choking is typically considered isentropic, meaning it is adiabatic (no heat transfer) and reversible (no friction losses).

### Occurrence of Choked Flow

Choked flow can occur in various fluid systems, typically involving nozzles, orifices, valves, or any passage that constricts the flow of a compressible fluid:

1. **Converging Nozzle**:
   - In a converging nozzle, as the fluid accelerates and the cross-sectional area decreases, the velocity increases. If the upstream pressure is high enough and the downstream pressure is low enough, the velocity at the nozzle's throat will reach the speed of sound, causing the flow to choke.

2. **Converging-Diverging (de Laval) Nozzle**:
   - In a converging-diverging nozzle, commonly used in rocket engines, choked flow occurs at the throat, where the cross-sectional area is smallest. The flow then continues to accelerate in the diverging section if the flow is supersonic.

3. **Orifice Plates and Valves**:
   - Choked flow can also occur across orifice plates, valves, or any other restriction in a piping system. In these cases, the flow velocity through the restriction reaches the speed of sound, and further reductions in downstream pressure do not increase the flow rate.

### Implications of Choked Flow

1. **Maximum Flow Rate**:
   - Choked flow represents the maximum possible mass flow rate through a given orifice or nozzle for a given upstream pressure and temperature. Beyond this point, no matter how much the downstream pressure decreases, the mass flow rate cannot increase.

2. **Flow Control**:
   - In many engineering applications, such as in rocket propulsion, gas pipelines, or industrial processes, understanding and controlling choked flow is essential for optimizing performance and ensuring safe operation.

3. **Pressure Recovery**:
   - In systems where choked flow occurs, there is often a significant pressure recovery (an increase in pressure) after the choke point in the diverging section of a nozzle or downstream of the orifice, particularly if the flow becomes subsonic again.

### Examples of Choked Flow

1. **Rocket Engines**:
   - Rocket engines utilize converging-diverging nozzles where the flow becomes choked at the throat, allowing for efficient expansion and acceleration of the exhaust gases to supersonic speeds in the diverging section.

2. **Gas Pipelines**:
   - In gas distribution systems, understanding choked flow is crucial for designing pipelines and control valves, as it affects the maximum flow rate and pressure drop across the system.

3. **Safety Valves**:
   - Safety valves in pressure vessels are designed to vent gases at high flow rates during overpressure conditions. Choked flow ensures that the valve can release the maximum flow rate needed to safely reduce pressure.

### Numerical and Analytical Analysis

1. **Isentropic Relations**:
   - For analyzing choked flow conditions, [[isentropic flow]] relations are often used to relate pressure, temperature, and velocity at different points in the flow field.

2. **CFD Simulations**:
   - Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are frequently used to model complex systems where choked flow might occur, helping engineers predict flow behavior, including shock formation and pressure distributions.

3. **Empirical Correlations**:
   - In industrial applications, empirical correlations and charts are often used to estimate the conditions under which choked flow occurs and to calculate the corresponding mass flow rate.

### Conclusion

**Choked flow** is a critical concept in [[compressible fluid dynamics]], representing the maximum flow rate that can occur through a restriction when the flow velocity reaches the speed of sound. Understanding choked flow is essential in a wide range of applications, from aerospace engineering to industrial process control. By ensuring that systems are designed with choked flow in mind, engineers can optimize performance, maintain safety, and accurately predict fluid behavior in high-speed flows.
