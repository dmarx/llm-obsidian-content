# Entropic Cost of Neural Parameter Acquisition

## Overview
The relationship between a model's [[Parameter Entropy]] and its [[Training Compute Budget]] represents a fundamental connection between information theory and computational resources in machine learning. This relationship can be understood through the lens of [[Thermodynamic Information Theory]].

## Formal Definition

Let:
- H(θ) represent the entropy of model parameters θ
- C(θ) represent the computational "mass" invested in training
- I(θ; D) represent the mutual information between parameters and training data D

## Theoretical Framework

### Information Acquisition Rate

The rate at which parameters acquire information during training can be expressed as:

dH(θ)/dC = η(C) · [H_max(θ) - H(θ)]

Where:
- η(C) is the [[Information Absorption Efficiency]]
- H_max(θ) is the maximum possible parameter entropy

### Entropic Accumulation Law

The total parameter entropy follows an accumulation law:

H(θ) = H_max(θ) · (1 - e^(-λC))

Where:
- λ is the [[Entropic Learning Rate]]
- C is the cumulative compute invested

## Computational Mass

### Definition
[[Computational Mass]] (M_c) represents the total computational resources invested in parameter optimization:

M_c = ∫(P(t)dt)

Where:
- P(t) is instantaneous computational power
- Integration is over training time

### Relationship to Entropy

The relationship between M_c and parameter entropy follows:

H(θ) ∝ log(1 + M_c/M₀)

Where:
- M₀ is a problem-specific [[Critical Mass Constant]]

## Information Theoretic Bounds

### Lower Bound
By [[Shannon's Source Coding Theorem]]:

C_min ≥ H(θ)/ε

Where:
- C_min is minimum required compute
- ε is the [[Computational Efficiency Factor]]

### Upper Bound
By [[Kolmogorov Complexity]] considerations:

H(θ) ≤ K(θ) + O(log(K(θ)))

Where:
- K(θ) is the Kolmogorov complexity of parameters

## Phase Transitions

### Critical Points

1. [[Information Saturation Point]]:
   C* where dH(θ)/dC approaches zero

2. [[Entropy Crystallization]]:
   C_crit where parameter structure emerges

### Phase Diagram

```
H(θ)
   ^
   |           ____---- Saturation Phase
   |        /
   |      /
   |    /     Learning Phase
   |  /
   |/   Initialization Phase
   +-------------------------> C
```

## Efficiency Metrics

1. [[Information Acquisition Efficiency]]:
   η_I = dH(θ)/dC

2. [[Entropic Return on Computation]]:
   ρ_E = ΔH(θ)/ΔC

3. [[Parameter Information Density]]:
   ρ_I = H(θ)/|θ|

## Practical Implications

### Training Optimization
1. [[Compute-Optimal Training Schedule]]:
   C*(t) = argmax_C [dH(θ)/dC]

2. [[Entropic Checkpoint Selection]]:
   Select checkpoints at maximum dH(θ)/dC

### Architecture Design
1. [[Information Capacity Planning]]:
   Size models based on H_max(θ) requirements

2. [[Computational Budget Allocation]]:
   Distribute compute based on dH(θ)/dC

## Open Questions

1. Is there a fundamental limit to η_I?
2. How does architecture affect H_max(θ)?
3. What determines the value of λ?
4. Can we predict C* a priori?
