group theory of positive semi-definite matrices

### Group Theory and Positive Semidefinite Matrices

Group theory typically studies the algebraic structures known as groups, characterized by a set equipped with an operation that combines any two of its elements to form a third element and satisfies the four conditions known as closure, associativity, identity, and invertibility. When discussing the set of positive semidefinite (PSD) matrices, while it exhibits some group-like properties under certain operations, it does not form a group under the usual matrix operations due to the lack of invertibility and closure under subtraction. However, there are related structures and concepts in group theory that can be applied to understand the behavior and properties of PSD matrices better.

### Non-Group Characteristics of PSD Matrices

1. **Closure Under Addition**: The set of PSD matrices is closed under addition. If \( A \) and \( B \) are PSD matrices, so is \( A + B \). However, this operation alone does not satisfy all group axioms because there is no element (matrix) that can act as an additive inverse for all PSD matrices that would keep the resulting matrix within the set of PSD matrices.

2. **Closure Under Multiplication**: While the product of two PSD matrices \( A \) and \( B \) (i.e., \( AB \) or \( BA \)) is not necessarily PSD, the product \( ABA^T \) is PSD. This closure under a form of multiplicative conjugation is significant but also does not fulfill group axioms, primarily because not all elements (matrices) are invertible within the space of PSD matrices.

3. **No Inverses**: In the space of PSD matrices, not every element has an inverse that is also PSD unless the matrix is also positive definite (hence invertible).

### Related Group Structures and Concepts

Though the set of PSD matrices itself does not form a group under standard matrix operations, several related group structures are critically relevant:

1. **General Linear Group \( GL(n) \)**: This group consists of all \( n \times n \) invertible matrices, which interacts with the space of PSD matrices. For instance, the action of \( GL(n) \) on the cone of PSD matrices via conjugation, \( A \mapsto XAX^T \) (where \( X \in GL(n) \)), preserves the positive semidefiniteness.

2. **Orthogonal and Unitary Groups**: These groups (orthogonal matrices for real matrices and unitary matrices for complex matrices) maintain the spectrum of the matrix upon conjugation. Conjugating a PSD matrix by an orthogonal (or unitary) matrix results in another PSD matrix, preserving properties like eigenvalues, which are critical in many applications.

### Cone Structures and Semigroups

1. **Convex Cone**: The set of PSD matrices forms a convex cone, which is a structure closed under positive scalar multiplication and addition. While not a group, this structure is vital in optimization and various algebraic manipulations.

2. **Semigroups**: Under certain operations, such as \( A \cdot B = ABA^T \), PSD matrices form a semigroup, which is a group-like structure lacking inverses. This is important in the context of dynamical systems and control theory.

### Application in Group Actions

- **Symmetric Space**: The space of positive definite matrices, a subset within the PSD matrices, can be considered a symmetric space under the action of the general linear group. This concept is useful in differential geometry and the theory of Lie groups.

### Conclusion

While the set of PSD matrices does not form a group in the traditional sense, understanding its interaction with group-related structures enhances the comprehension and application of these matrices in mathematics and physics. The study of actions of groups like \( GL(n) \) on the cone of PSD matrices, the properties preserved under such actions, and the structural role of PSD matrices in convex analysis and semigroup theory are fundamental to many advanced theories and applications.
