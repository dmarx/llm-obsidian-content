### Spectral Theory Overview

Spectral theory is a branch of mathematics that studies the spectrum of linear operators, particularly those acting on vector spaces or more generally on [[Hilbert spaces]] and [[Banach spaces]]. The spectrum of an operator generalizes the concept of eigenvalues for matrices and plays a crucial role in understanding the behavior of linear transformations, differential operators, and other linear systems.

### Spectrum of an Operator

Given a linear operator \(T: \mathcal{D}(T) \subset \mathcal{H} \to \mathcal{H}\), where \(\mathcal{H}\) is a [[Hilbert space]] and \(\mathcal{D}(T)\) is the domain of \(T\), the **spectrum** of \(T\), denoted by \(\sigma(T)\), is the set of complex numbers \(\lambda \in \mathbb{C}\) for which the operator \(T - \lambda I\) is **not** invertible. This means that \(\lambda \) is in the spectrum of \(T\) if one or more of the following conditions hold:

1. **\(T - \lambda I\) is not injective (has nontrivial kernel)**: There exists a non-zero \(x \in \mathcal{D}(T)\) such that \(T(x) = \lambda x\). In this case, \(\lambda\) is an **eigenvalue** of \(T\).
2. **\(T - \lambda I\) is not surjective**: The range of \(T - \lambda I\) is not the entire space \(\mathcal{H}\).
3. **\(T - \lambda I\) is not bounded below**: There is no constant \(C > 0\) such that \(\| (T - \lambda I)x \| \geq C \|x\|\) for all \(x \in \mathcal{D}(T)\).

### Decomposition of the Spectrum

The spectrum \(\sigma(T)\) can be further decomposed into three main parts:

1. **Point Spectrum** (\(\sigma_p(T)\)): The set of eigenvalues of \(T\). These are the values of \(\lambda\) for which \(T - \lambda I\) fails to be injective.
  
2. **Continuous Spectrum** (\(\sigma_c(T)\)): The set of \(\lambda\) for which \(T - \lambda I\) is injective and has dense range in \(\mathcal{H}\), but is not surjective.

3. **Residual Spectrum** (\(\sigma_r(T)\)): The set of \(\lambda\) for which \(T - \lambda I\) is injective but does not have dense range, meaning the range is a proper subset of \(\mathcal{H}\).

### Spectral Theorem

One of the cornerstone results in spectral theory is the **Spectral Theorem**, which provides a structure theorem for normal operators on Hilbert spaces. 

- **Spectral Theorem for Bounded Operators**: If \(T\) is a bounded, normal operator on a Hilbert space \(\mathcal{H}\), then \(T\) can be represented as an integral with respect to a projection-valued measure. Specifically, there exists a unique projection-valued measure \(E(\lambda)\) defined on the Borel subsets of \(\mathbb{C}\) such that:
  \[
  T = \int_{\sigma(T)} \lambda \, dE(\lambda)
  \]
  This representation allows us to understand \(T\) in terms of its action on the spectrum, with the spectrum playing a role analogous to eigenvalues in finite-dimensional settings.

### Unbounded Operators and Self-Adjoint Operators

In the case of unbounded operators, which frequently appear in quantum mechanics and differential operators, the Spectral Theorem still applies but requires a more nuanced formulation.

- **Spectral Theorem for Self-Adjoint Operators**: If \(T\) is a self-adjoint operator (i.e., \(T = T^*\)) on a Hilbert space, \(T\) can be represented similarly by a spectral measure:
  \[
  T = \int_{\sigma(T)} \lambda \, dE(\lambda)
  \]
  where \(E(\lambda)\) is now a projection-valued measure on \(\mathbb{R}\). 

### Applications

Spectral theory has extensive applications across various fields:

- **Quantum Mechanics**: In the study of quantum systems, operators such as the Hamiltonian (which represents the total energy of the system) are self-adjoint, and their spectra correspond to possible measurements of energy.

- **Differential Equations**: The study of differential operators via their spectra allows for the analysis of stability, oscillatory behavior, and wave propagation.

- **Functional Analysis**: Spectral theory provides the foundation for understanding and solving linear operator equations, crucial in many areas of pure and applied mathematics.

- [[Functional Calculus]] (for the application of functions to operators in the spectral sense)

Spectral theory thus bridges abstract mathematical structures with concrete physical phenomena, making it a powerful tool in both theoretical and applied contexts.
