Countersurveillance Routes


**ASSISTANT**

**Countersurveillance Routes (CSRs)** are carefully planned movements designed to evade, disrupt, or confirm the presence of hostile surveillance teams tracking an individual. While **Surveillance Detection Routes (SDRs)** are primarily intended to detect surveillance, CSRs go further: they not only aim to detect but also actively break contact with the surveillance team. This can be essential for intelligence officers who need to meet with assets, conduct secure exchanges, or otherwise carry out sensitive operations without being observed.

Executing an effective CSR requires a deep understanding of surveillance tactics, a flexible approach to route planning, and advanced use of environmental features. CSRs are often highly complex and involve rapid adaptability to real-time observations.

Below is an in-depth exploration of **Countersurveillance Routes**, including principles, techniques, types, and real-world applications.

### **Core Principles of Countersurveillance Routes**

1. **Verification and Disruption**: CSRs are designed not only to confirm the presence of surveillance but also to disrupt and shake it off. This may involve changing directions, varying speeds, switching modes of transportation, and using blind spots or choke points.

2. **Multiple Contingency Plans**: CSRs often require a set of pre-planned contingencies, or backup routes, that can be executed based on real-time observations of surveillance behavior. Officers must have detailed knowledge of their environment and be prepared to pivot quickly.

3. **Use of the Environment**: CSRs leverage urban features, natural barriers, crowded areas, and terrain to create obstacles for a pursuing surveillance team. This includes using public transport, alleys, or entering buildings with multiple exits to force surveillance to reveal itself or lose contact.

4. **Deniability**: The behaviors in a CSR must be casual enough to avoid drawing attention or appearing unnatural to observers, including the surveillance team. Operatives avoid overly conspicuous maneuvers and blend movements into the flow of regular urban activities.

5. **Layered Techniques**: Effective CSRs combine multiple tactics in sequence to maintain unpredictability and keep the surveillance team off-balance. By layering movements (foot, vehicle, public transport) and timing variations, officers increase the difficulty for surveillance teams.

### **Stages of a Countersurveillance Route**

CSRs typically involve several stages, each designed to disrupt, confuse, or evade surveillance teams while confirming whether they’re still being followed. Below is a general structure of a CSR with associated tactics and techniques.

#### **1. Initial Observation and Pattern Recognition**

   - **Objective**: Establish a baseline and observe for any obvious surveillance presence without alerting the surveillance team.
   - **Techniques**:
     - Begin with casual, everyday actions to avoid suspicion (e.g., browsing storefronts, sitting at a café).
     - Note any vehicles, individuals, or groups who seem to be maintaining a presence or mirroring movements.
   - **Indicators of Surveillance**:
     - The same vehicle or individual appearing multiple times in the vicinity.
     - Individuals who are present in various locations along the initial leg of the route, especially if they keep a consistent distance or try to blend in conspicuously.

#### **2. Directional Changes and “Doubling Back”**

   - **Objective**: Use abrupt direction changes to test persistence and identify potential surveillance operatives.
   - **Techniques**:
     - **Doubling Back**: Walk past a location, then turn back after a short period. Surveillance operatives often reveal themselves by turning around in response.
     - **Circling Blocks**: Make loops around the block, which forces surveillance teams to either follow or attempt to wait around the corner, increasing their exposure.
   - **Indicators of Surveillance**:
     - Repeated sightings of individuals or vehicles doubling back or attempting to maintain a consistent distance despite sudden changes.
     - Observers “waiting” in the general area after a loop or abrupt change in direction.

#### **3. Use of Choke Points**

   - **Objective**: Force potential surveillance teams into confined areas where they must reveal themselves.
   - **Techniques**:
     - **Entering Narrow Spaces**: Use narrow alleys, pedestrian tunnels, or staircases, where only one person can pass at a time. This forces a follower to either reveal themselves or abandon the route.
     - **Crossing Through a One-Way Street**: Enter one-way streets in busy areas, using vehicular traffic flow as a shield. This makes it difficult for a surveillance vehicle to follow without breaking obvious traffic patterns.
     - **Elevators and Stairwells**: Enter an elevator alone, especially in busy buildings with multiple exits. Disembark on random floors and observe if anyone from earlier in the route appears nearby.
   - **Indicators of Surveillance**:
     - Individuals entering or following through narrow passages.
     - Vehicles appearing at the end of a one-way street or other restricted access areas repeatedly.

#### **4. Public Transport Switching**

   - **Objective**: Add complexity by incorporating multiple modes of transportation, forcing surveillance to adapt.
   - **Techniques**:
     - **Board Public Transport Suddenly**: Board a bus or subway at the last minute to force surveillance to react. If followed, disembark at a non-terminus stop without notice.
     - **Switch Transit Lines**: Use a subway or bus transfer to a different line to see if individuals also make the same switch.
     - **Use Multiple Exits**: At multi-exit subway or transit stations, disembark and use a different exit than the one closest to your starting location.
   - **Indicators of Surveillance**:
     - Individuals or groups making the same line transfers or exiting at the same stop.
     - People who appear repeatedly at different points along the transit route.

#### **5. Disguise and Blending with Crowds**

   - **Objective**: Make it difficult for surveillance to keep track by blending into dense crowds and using subtle changes in appearance.
   - **Techniques**:
     - **Crowd Integration**: Enter crowded areas like markets, malls, or transit hubs, where moving inconspicuously among people makes it hard to maintain line of sight.
     - **Quick Appearance Changes**: Change outer clothing (e.g., hat, jacket) subtly in a bathroom or through layer adjustments. This can cause a momentary delay in identification for the surveillance team.
     - **Doubling Back Through Crowds**: Move quickly in one direction, then reverse through the crowd to see if anyone struggles to follow.
   - **Indicators of Surveillance**:
     - Individuals who linger near exits or entrances to crowded areas, waiting for visual re-identification.
     - People who suddenly change behavior, such as quickly moving to follow if they momentarily lose sight.

#### **6. Concealed Observation from High Vantage Points**

   - **Objective**: Use high-ground observation to detect surveillance while remaining hidden.
   - **Techniques**:
     - **Elevated Observation Points**: Go to rooftops, parking garages, or upper floors in a building to observe the street or specific areas discreetly.
     - **Stairwells and Fire Escapes**: Use stairwells with windows or multiple vantage points to look for suspicious patterns in surrounding streets.
   - **Indicators of Surveillance**:
     - Surveillance vehicles circling or stopping below observation points.
     - Individuals who repeatedly appear in the vicinity of exits or entrances of buildings with elevated view points.

#### **7. Blind Exits and Multiple Destination Changes**

   - **Objective**: Ensure that all potential surveillance has been evaded and proceed to the final destination securely.
   - **Techniques**:
     - **Enter Buildings with Multiple Exits**: Enter a building with multiple exits (e.g., a hotel or department store) and exit through a different door. This forces surveillance teams to split or make guesswork decisions.
     - **Simulate Casual Behaviors**: After entering a final safe zone, behave in a low-profile, inconspicuous manner to avoid any lingering observation.
     - **Final Concealment**: If meeting an asset or transferring information, use a previously prepared cover (e.g., seated area in a café or restaurant) to minimize exposure.
   - **Indicators of Effective CSR**:
     - No signs of persistent individuals or vehicles near the destination.
     - Absence of observers in previously frequented locations along the route.

### **Types of Countersurveillance Routes**

1. **Static CSR**: Used in small, controlled environments, such as a single neighborhood, where an operative loops and changes directions repeatedly to monitor for nearby surveillance.
   
2. **Dynamic CSR**: Incorporates long-distance travel, public transport switching, and quick maneuvers to evade pursuit in urban environments with more significant surveillance presence.

3. **Layered CSR**: Uses multiple modes of transportation (foot, vehicle, public transport) and multiple exits. Designed for hostile environments where high-stakes meetings require absolute security.

### **Training Exercises for CSRs**

**1. Role-Playing and Live Surveillance Scenarios**:
   - Trainees practice planned CSRs in live environments, with instructors acting as surveillance teams. Exercises test their ability to spot and evade surveillance.

**2. Route Planning and Contingency Drills**:
   - Trainees work on detailed CSR plans in real-world locations, with multiple contingencies based on possible surveillance reactions.

**3. Dynamic Route Adaptation**:
   - Instructors simulate random changes in surveillance behavior, requiring trainees to adapt CSR tactics on the fly.

**4. Multi-Team Exercises**:
   - Surveillance teams are assigned different methods (foot, vehicular, technical) to track the trainee, requiring them to employ layered CSR techniques and adjust based on real-time developments.
