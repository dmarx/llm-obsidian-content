### Hough Functions

**Hough functions** (also known as Hough harmonics) are a set of orthogonal eigenfunctions used in the analysis of atmospheric and oceanic waves on a rotating sphere, such as the Earth. They arise in the context of solving the linearized [[shallow water equations]] or the linearized [[primitive equations]], which govern the behavior of large-scale geophysical flows, such as planetary waves, tides, and other oscillatory phenomena in the atmosphere and oceans.

### Key Concepts

1. **Shallow Water Equations**:
   - **Rotating Sphere**: The [[shallow water equations]] describe fluid flow on the surface of a rotating sphere, such as the Earth. These equations take into account the effects of rotation (via the Coriolis force), gravity, and fluid depth.
   - **Linearized Equations**: For small perturbations around a state of rest, the [[shallow water equations]] can be linearized. The resulting equations describe wave motions, including Rossby waves, Kelvin waves, and [[gravity waves]].

2. **Separation of Variables**:
   - **Laplace's Tidal Equations**: The linearized [[shallow water equations]] on a rotating sphere are known as Laplace's tidal equations. They can be solved using a separation of variables, where the solution is expressed as a product of functions depending on latitude (the meridional structure) and longitude/time (the zonal and temporal structure).
   - **Hough Functions**: The meridional structure of the solution is described by the Hough functions, which are the eigenfunctions of the associated linear differential operator.

3. **Eigenvalue Problem**:
   - **Governing Equation**: The Hough functions are solutions to an eigenvalue problem derived from the [[shallow water equations]]. The operator typically involves terms related to the Earth's rotation, such as the Coriolis parameter, and the Laplacian on the sphere.
   - **Associated Legendre Functions**: For non-rotating cases, the eigenfunctions reduce to the associated Legendre functions. However, for a rotating sphere, the solutions (Hough functions) are more complex and account for the effects of rotation.

4. **Classification**:
   - **Prograde and Retrograde Modes**: Hough functions are classified into prograde (eastward) and retrograde (westward) modes based on their direction of propagation relative to the Earth's rotation.
   - **Gravitational and Rotational Modes**: They can also be categorized as gravitational (Poincaré) modes, which are primarily influenced by gravity, and rotational (Rossby) modes, which are primarily influenced by the Earth's rotation.

### Mathematical Description

1. **Laplace's Tidal Equations**:
   - **Formulation**: The linearized [[shallow water equations]] on a rotating sphere can be expressed as:
     $$
     \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} - f v = -g \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x}
     $$
     $$
     \frac{\partial v}{\partial t} + f u = -g \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial y}
     $$
     $$
     \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} + H \left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}\right) = 0
     $$
     where \( u \) and \( v \) are the velocity components in the eastward and northward directions, \( f \) is the Coriolis parameter, \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity, \( \eta \) is the surface displacement, and \( H \) is the mean fluid depth.

2. **Eigenvalue Problem**:
   - **Meridional Equation**: By assuming a separable solution for the form \( \psi(\lambda, \phi, t) = \Theta(\phi) e^{i(m\lambda - \omega t)} \) (where \( \lambda \) is longitude, \( \phi \) is latitude, \( m \) is the zonal wavenumber, and \( \omega \) is the frequency), the meridional equation for \( \Theta(\phi) \) can be written as:
     $$
     \frac{d}{d\phi} \left( \cos\phi \frac{d\Theta}{d\phi} \right) + \left[ \Lambda - \frac{m^2}{\cos^2\phi} - \frac{4\Omega^2 \cos^2\phi}{gH} \right] \Theta = 0
     $$
     where \( \Lambda \) is the separation constant (related to the eigenvalue), and \( \Omega \) is the Earth's rotation rate.
   - **Hough Functions**: The solutions \( \Theta(\phi) \) are the Hough functions, which depend on the eigenvalue \( \Lambda \) and the parameters related to Earth's rotation and the geometry of the problem.

3. **Orthogonality and Completeness**:
   - **Orthogonality**: Hough functions are orthogonal with respect to a suitable weight function over the range of latitudes. This orthogonality property is crucial for expanding arbitrary functions (such as initial conditions or forcing terms) in terms of Hough functions.
   - **Completeness**: The set of Hough functions forms a complete basis for representing the meridional structure of solutions to the [[shallow water equations]]. This means that any meridional distribution of a wave mode can be expressed as a sum (or series) of Hough functions.

### Applications of Hough Functions

1. **Atmospheric Tides**:
   - **Global Atmospheric Models**: Hough functions are used in the study of atmospheric tides, which are global-scale oscillations in the atmosphere driven by various forcings, including solar heating, gravitational effects, and the interaction with surface topography.
   - **Tidal Decomposition**: Atmospheric waves, including tides, can be decomposed into Hough modes, allowing for a detailed analysis of their structure and propagation characteristics.

2. **Oceanic Waves**:
   - **Ocean Tides**: Similar to atmospheric tides, Hough functions are used in the analysis of ocean tides, particularly in the context of tidal waves propagating on the Earth's rotating ocean surface.
   - **Rossby and Poincaré Waves**: Hough functions help describe the behavior of Rossby and Poincaré waves in the ocean, capturing their meridional structure and the effects of rotation.

3. **Climate Dynamics**:
   - **Planetary Waves**: Large-scale planetary waves in the atmosphere, such as Rossby waves, can be analyzed using Hough functions, aiding in the understanding of phenomena like the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) and the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO).
   - **Modeling and Prediction**: Hough functions are utilized in climate models to represent the global structure of atmospheric and oceanic waves, contributing to more accurate predictions of weather patterns and climate variability.

### Conclusion

**Hough functions** play a crucial role in the analysis of wave phenomena on a rotating sphere, such as the Earth. They provide a powerful mathematical tool for understanding the meridional structure of atmospheric and oceanic waves, including tides, Rossby waves, and other large-scale oscillations. By solving the eigenvalue problem associated with the linearized [[shallow water equations]], Hough functions offer a complete and orthogonal basis for representing these wave modes, enabling detailed studies in [[geophysical fluid dynamics]], climate modeling, and atmospheric science.
