**ASSISTANT**

In the context of creating content for a technical reference wiki, "narrowly relevant" means focusing on information that is directly applicable and essential to the topic at hand, without including extraneous details. Here are a few guidelines and examples to illustrate this:

1. **Specific Definitions and Theorems**: Provide precise definitions and state relevant theorems or propositions that directly support the topic.

2. **Focused Examples**: Use examples that illustrate the key points without unnecessary complexity.

3. **Relevant Formulas and Proofs**: Include only those formulas and proofs that are directly related to the main topic.

4. **Contextual Links**: Link to other relevant articles or sections within the wiki to provide additional context or detailed explanations.

### Example: Narrowly Relevant Content on Markov Chains

#### Definition
A **Markov chain** is a stochastic process that satisfies the Markov property, which states that the future state depends only on the present state and not on the sequence of events that preceded it. Formally, a discrete-time Markov chain $\{X_n\}$ on a state space $S$ is defined by the property:
$$
P(X_{n+1} = j \mid X_n = i, X_{n-1} = i_{n-1}, \ldots, X_0 = i_0) = P(X_{n+1} = j \mid X_n = i)
$$
for all $n \geq 0$ and all states $i, j \in S$.

#### Transition Matrix
The behavior of a Markov chain is described by its **transition matrix** $P$, where $P_{ij} = P(X_{n+1} = j \mid X_n = i)$. The matrix $P$ must satisfy:
$$
\sum_{j \in S} P_{ij} = 1 \quad \text{for all } i \in S
$$

#### Example
Consider a Markov chain with state space $S = \{1, 2, 3\}$ and the following transition matrix:
$$
P = \begin{pmatrix}
0.5 & 0.3 & 0.2 \\
0.1 & 0.6 & 0.3 \\
0.4 & 0.4 & 0.2
\end{pmatrix}
$$
The probability of transitioning from state 1 to state 2 in one step is $P_{12} = 0.3$.

#### Stationary Distribution
A **stationary distribution** $\pi$ is a probability distribution over the states such that if the chain starts in $\pi$, it remains in $\pi$ at all times. Mathematically, $\pi$ satisfies:
$$
\pi P = \pi
$$
where $\pi$ is a row vector. For the given transition matrix $P$, solving $\pi P = \pi$ with the constraint $\sum_{i \in S} \pi_i = 1$ provides the stationary distribution.

### Conclusion
By focusing on these narrowly relevant details, the content remains precise and directly applicable to the study of Markov chains, aiding in both understanding and application. This approach avoids overwhelming the reader with unrelated information, maintaining a clear and effective presentation of the topic.
