Plank's Law


**ASSISTANT**

**Planck's Law** describes the spectral energy distribution of electromagnetic radiation emitted by a blackbody in thermal equilibrium. It was derived by Max Planck in 1900 and marked a foundational development in quantum mechanics, resolving the failure of classical physics to explain blackbody radiation (i.e., the ultraviolet catastrophe).

### Mathematical Formulation of Planck's Law

Planck's Law gives the [[spectral energy density]] $u(\nu, T)$, which represents the energy per unit volume per unit frequency emitted by a blackbody at temperature $T$ as a function of the frequency $\nu$:

$$ u(\nu, T) = \frac{8 \pi h \nu^3}{c^3} \frac{1}{e^{\frac{h\nu}{k_B T}} - 1} $$

Alternatively, in terms of the wavelength $\lambda$, the [[spectral energy density]] is:

$$ u(\lambda, T) = \frac{8 \pi h c}{\lambda^5} \frac{1}{e^{\frac{hc}{\lambda k_B T}} - 1} $$

where:
- $u(\nu, T)$ is the [[spectral energy density]] per unit frequency,
- $u(\lambda, T)$ is the [[spectral energy density]] per unit wavelength,
- $h$ is [[Planck's constant]],
- $k_B$ is the [[Boltzmann constant]],
- $c$ is the speed of light,
- $\nu$ is the frequency of radiation,
- $\lambda$ is the wavelength of radiation,
- $T$ is the absolute temperature of the blackbody.

### Physical Interpretation

Planck's law provides a complete description of the distribution of energy across different frequencies or wavelengths for a blackbody radiator. 

- **Low frequencies** (or long wavelengths): At low frequencies, where $h\nu \ll k_B T$, Planck's law simplifies to the **Rayleigh-Jeans law**, which is consistent with classical physics:
  
  $$ u(\nu, T) \approx \frac{8 \pi \nu^2 k_B T}{c^3} $$

- **High frequencies** (or short wavelengths): At high frequencies, where $h\nu \gg k_B T$, the [[spectral energy density]] drops off exponentially, solving the **ultraviolet catastrophe**. This behavior is captured by the **Wien approximation**:

  $$ u(\nu, T) \approx \frac{8 \pi h \nu^3}{c^3} e^{-\frac{h\nu}{k_B T}} $$

Thus, Planck's law predicts that the intensity of radiation increases with frequency up to a certain point and then decreases exponentially at higher frequencies, preventing the infinite energy predicted by classical theories.

### Derivation of Planck's Law

Planck derived his law by introducing the idea that electromagnetic radiation is quantized. He assumed that the energy of the radiation could only take discrete values proportional to the frequency, i.e., $E = h\nu$, where $h$ is Planck’s constant. This assumption was radical for the time, as classical physics treated energy as continuous.

The steps in the derivation include:
1. **Quantization of Energy**: Radiation is emitted and absorbed in discrete packets or quanta of energy $E = h\nu$.
2. **Statistical Mechanics**: Using Boltzmann's distribution for thermal equilibrium, Planck calculated the average energy of a quantized mode as:
   $$ \langle E \rangle = \frac{h\nu}{e^{h\nu/k_B T} - 1} $$
3. **Electromagnetic Mode Counting**: The number of modes of electromagnetic radiation per unit volume, per unit frequency, is proportional to $\nu^2$, leading to the final form of Planck's law after multiplying by the average energy per mode.

### Key Features of Planck’s Law

1. **Temperature Dependence**: The distribution of energy shifts with temperature. At higher temperatures, more energy is emitted at all frequencies, and the peak of the distribution moves to higher frequencies (shorter wavelengths).
  
2. **Wien’s Displacement Law**: The wavelength $\lambda_{\text{max}}$ at which the [[spectral energy density]] peaks is inversely proportional to temperature:
   $$ \lambda_{\text{max}} T = 2.898 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m} \cdot \text{K} $$
   This is known as **Wien’s displacement law**. Hotter objects emit more radiation at shorter wavelengths.

3. **Total Energy (Stefan-Boltzmann Law)**: The total energy radiated per unit surface area of a blackbody across all wavelengths is given by the **Stefan-Boltzmann law**, which is derived by integrating Planck's law over all frequencies:
   $$ j^* = \sigma T^4 $$
   where $j^*$ is the total radiated energy flux, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $\sigma = 5.670 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{W/m}^2\text{K}^4$ is the **Stefan-Boltzmann constant**.

### Applications of Planck's Law

1. **Astrophysics**: Planck's law is used to model the emission spectra of stars and other astronomical bodies, treating them as approximate blackbodies. For example, the Sun emits most of its radiation in the visible range, with its spectrum closely following Planck's law for a temperature of about 5778 K.

2. **Cosmology**: Planck’s law also describes the **cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB)**, which is the relic radiation from the Big Bang. The CMB has a nearly perfect blackbody spectrum with a temperature of about 2.725 K.

3. **Thermal Radiation**: In engineering, Planck's law is used to analyze the radiation emitted by heated objects (e.g., in furnace design, radiative heat transfer calculations, and thermal imaging).

4. **Quantum Theory**: Planck's quantization of energy was the birth of **quantum theory**, leading to the development of quantum mechanics. The assumption that energy is quantized in discrete units directly influenced Einstein’s explanation of the photoelectric effect and later developments in quantum physics.

### Comparison with Classical Laws

#### Rayleigh-Jeans Law (Classical Limit):
At low frequencies, Planck’s law reduces to the classical **Rayleigh-Jeans law**:
$$ u(\nu, T) \approx \frac{8 \pi \nu^2 k_B T}{c^3} $$

This describes how the [[spectral energy density]] scales quadratically with frequency, which works well in the radio and microwave regions but fails at higher frequencies, where it predicts infinite energy (the **ultraviolet catastrophe**).

#### Wien's Law (High-Frequency Limit):
At high frequencies, Planck’s law approaches the **Wien approximation**:
$$ u(\nu, T) \approx \frac{8 \pi h \nu^3}{c^3} e^{-\frac{h\nu}{k_B T}} $$

This exponential decay prevents the ultraviolet catastrophe and correctly predicts the rapid falloff in energy density at short wavelengths.

### Conclusion

**Planck’s Law** is a cornerstone of modern physics, describing the energy distribution of blackbody radiation and leading to the development of quantum mechanics. It successfully explains the spectral characteristics of thermal radiation, solves the ultraviolet catastrophe, and provides insights into a wide range of phenomena, from the radiation emitted by stars to the cosmic microwave background.
