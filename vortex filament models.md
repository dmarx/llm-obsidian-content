vortex filament models


**ASSISTANT**

**Vortex filament models** are a theoretical approach used to study the dynamics of [[quantized vortices]] in superfluids, especially in the context of [[quantum turbulence]]. In systems like superfluid helium ($^4$He or $^3$He) and Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), vortex filaments represent the cores of [[quantized vortices]], treated as one-dimensional curves or lines in space. The vortex filament approximation simplifies the modeling of complex vortex interactions, reconnections, and the transfer of energy across scales by focusing on the motion and deformation of these vortex lines.

### Motivation and Context of Vortex Filament Models

In quantum fluids, **[[quantized vortices]]** are topological defects where the phase of the macroscopic wavefunction $\Psi$ winds by integer multiples of $2\pi$. The circulation around each vortex is quantized:
$$
\oint \mathbf{v} \cdot d\mathbf{l} = \frac{2\pi \hbar}{m} n,
$$
where $\mathbf{v}$ is the superfluid velocity, $m$ is the mass of a single particle in the condensate, and $n$ is an integer winding number. The core of a quantized vortex has a radius on the order of the **healing length** $\xi$, beyond which the density of the superfluid reaches its bulk value.

In systems like superfluid helium, the size of the vortex core is on the order of an angstrom, making it impractical to model as a continuous field in macroscopic simulations. Instead, the vortex core is treated as a thin, one-dimensional **filament**. This filament represents the centerline of the vortex core, and its dynamics are determined by the superfluid’s macroscopic flow and interactions with other vortices.

### Mathematical Formulation of the Vortex Filament Model

A vortex filament is parameterized by a position vector $\mathbf{s} = \mathbf{s}(\xi, t)$, where $\xi$ is the arc length along the filament and $t$ is time. The position $\mathbf{s}$ evolves according to the **Biot-Savart law**, which describes the velocity field generated by the filament itself. For a point on the filament, the velocity $\mathbf{v}(\mathbf{s})$ is given by:
$$
\mathbf{v}(\mathbf{s}) = \frac{\kappa}{4\pi} \int_{\mathcal{L}} \frac{(\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{s}) \times d\mathbf{s}'}{|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{s}|^3},
$$
where:
- $\kappa = \frac{h}{m}$ is the circulation quantum (where $h$ is Planck’s constant, and $m$ is the mass of a superfluid particle),
- $\mathcal{L}$ represents the vortex filament,
- $\mathbf{r}$ is the observation point on the filament, and
- $d\mathbf{s}'$ is an infinitesimal segment of the filament.

This integral expresses the velocity at a given point on the filament as a result of the contributions from all other segments of the vortex. The **Biot-Savart law** is analogous to the magnetic field generated by a current-carrying wire and can be interpreted as an inverse-cube law for the induced superfluid velocity.

### Local Induction Approximation (LIA)

For a single filament in the absence of other interactions, a **local induction approximation (LIA)** is often used to simplify the Biot-Savart integral. In the LIA, only the immediate neighborhood of each point on the filament is considered, leading to a reduced velocity expression:
$$
\frac{d \mathbf{s}}{dt} = \beta \mathbf{s}' \times \mathbf{s}'',
$$
where:
- $\mathbf{s}' = \frac{\partial \mathbf{s}}{\partial \xi}$ is the unit tangent vector along the filament,
- $\mathbf{s}'' = \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{s}}{\partial \xi^2}$ is the local curvature vector,
- $\beta$ is a constant proportional to the quantum of circulation $\kappa$ and depends on the local properties of the fluid.

The LIA reveals that vortex filaments tend to evolve in response to their local curvature, inducing **Kelvin waves** (helical oscillations along the vortex) and other structures, which are fundamental to the behavior of quantum turbulence. This approximation is especially useful for modeling complex interactions between filaments or studying vortex reconnections.

### Key Phenomena Captured by Vortex Filament Models

1. **Vortex Reconnections**: In quantum turbulence, vortices frequently undergo reconnection events, where two vortex lines come close, reconnect, and exchange segments. Although reconnections are not directly captured by the GPE or Biot-Savart framework, vortex filament models often include reconnection rules, allowing simulations to mimic this process. Reconnections facilitate energy cascade processes in quantum turbulence, contributing to the transfer of energy from larger to smaller scales.

2. **Kelvin Waves and Kelvin Wave Cascade**: Vortex filaments can support **Kelvin waves**, which are oscillations that propagate along the filament, characterized by helical or twisting motions. Kelvin waves are important for the **energy cascade** in quantum turbulence, where energy is transferred from large, collective vortex structures down to smaller scales. Eventually, this energy can dissipate as sound waves or phonons, especially at very low temperatures in superfluid helium.

3. **Vortex Tangle Formation**: In a turbulent quantum fluid, vortex filaments can form complex tangles, with vortices interacting and reconnecting in a chaotic network. The dynamics of this vortex tangle resemble the eddy-like structures seen in classical turbulence, making the vortex filament model essential for studying [[quantum turbulence]] at macroscopic scales.

4. **Polarized Vortex Configurations and Vortex Lattices**: In rotating superfluids, vortex filaments align into stable, ordered structures known as **vortex lattices**. Filament models can capture the formation of these lattices and their stability, where the vortices arrange themselves in regular patterns, often triangular, to minimize the system's energy. This arrangement mimics the behavior of vortices in rotating BECs or in Type-II superconductors.

### Numerical Simulation of Vortex Filaments

Simulating vortex filament dynamics requires handling both the **Biot-Savart law** and **reconnection events**. The Biot-Savart integral is computationally expensive due to its long-range nature, as each filament segment contributes to the velocity at every other segment. Various methods, such as **tree codes** and **fast multipole methods**, are often used to reduce the computational cost.

To handle vortex reconnections in simulations, heuristic criteria are typically employed:
- **Minimum Distance Criterion**: When two segments of filaments come closer than a threshold distance, a reconnection event is triggered, swapping segments and creating two new filaments.
- **Energy Dissipation Mechanisms**: To simulate the effect of phonon radiation or other forms of dissipation, additional terms may be added to the model to allow for small-scale energy losses, especially after reconnections.

### Applications and Limitations

#### Applications
Vortex filament models have been used in a variety of applications:
- **Quantum Turbulence Studies**: Vortex filament models allow detailed simulations of quantum turbulence, enabling the study of phenomena like energy cascade processes, turbulence decay, and the statistical properties of vortex tangles.
- **Superfluid Helium Experiments**: Vortex filament models are particularly suited for modeling superfluid helium systems, where the core sizes are small enough to justify the filament approximation.
- **Astrophysical Analogies**: Some aspects of filament behavior have applications in astrophysics, such as understanding magnetic flux tubes in plasmas and vortex formation in neutron stars.

#### Limitations
While powerful, vortex filament models have certain limitations:
- **Inability to Resolve Core Structures**: Filament models treat vortices as infinitely thin lines, which limits their accuracy in situations where core structure plays an important role, such as vortex interactions at very small length scales.
- **Lack of Thermal Effects**: The vortex filament model typically assumes a pure superfluid. At finite temperatures, where normal fluid components and mutual friction become relevant, additional modifications are necessary to account for two-fluid interactions.
- **Empirical Nature of Reconnection Rules**: Vortex reconnections are included via empirical rules, not derived from first principles. This means that simulations rely on assumptions for reconnection dynamics, and the model does not fully capture the microscopic processes involved.

### Summary

Vortex filament models provide a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of [[quantized vortices]] in superfluids, capturing essential phenomena like vortex reconnections, Kelvin waves, and quantum turbulence. While they are an approximation and rely on empirical rules for certain processes, these models are invaluable for simulating large-scale vortex dynamics in superfluid systems where quantum effects play a central role.
