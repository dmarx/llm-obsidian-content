Hubbard Model


**ASSISTANT**

The Hubbard model is a simple yet powerful theoretical framework used to describe the behavior of electrons in a lattice, accounting for both their kinetic energy and their interactions. It plays a crucial role in the study of strongly correlated electron systems, magnetism, and high-temperature superconductivity.

### Key Concepts

1. **Lattice**:
   The Hubbard model considers a system of electrons moving on a discrete lattice, where each lattice site can be occupied by at most two electrons (one with spin up and one with spin down).

2. **Kinetic Energy**:
   Electrons can hop between neighboring lattice sites. The kinetic energy term is represented by the hopping parameter \(t\), which describes the amplitude for an electron to move from one site to an adjacent site.

3. **On-Site Interaction**:
   When two electrons occupy the same lattice site, they experience an on-site Coulomb repulsion described by the interaction parameter \(U\).

### Hubbard Model Hamiltonian

The Hamiltonian of the Hubbard model is given by:
$$
\hat{H} = -t \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle, \sigma} (c_{i\sigma}^\dagger c_{j\sigma} + \text{H.c.}) + U \sum_{i} \hat{n}_{i\uparrow} \hat{n}_{i\downarrow}
$$
where:
- \(c_{i\sigma}^\dagger\) (\(c_{i\sigma}\)) are the creation (annihilation) operators for an electron with spin \(\sigma\) (\(\uparrow\) or \(\downarrow\)) at site \(i\).
- \(\hat{n}_{i\sigma} = c_{i\sigma}^\dagger c_{i\sigma}\) is the number operator for electrons with spin \(\sigma\) at site \(i\).
- \(t\) is the hopping parameter between nearest-neighbor sites \(\langle i,j \rangle\).
- \(U\) is the on-site Coulomb repulsion.

### Limits of the Hubbard Model

1. **Non-Interacting Limit (\(U = 0\))**:
   When \(U = 0\), the Hubbard model reduces to the [[tight-binding model]], where electrons move freely across the lattice without any interaction.

2. **Strong Coupling Limit (\(U \gg t\))**:
   When \(U \gg t\), the model describes a system where the kinetic energy is small compared to the interaction energy. Electrons tend to avoid double occupancy, leading to Mott insulating behavior at half-filling (one electron per site on average).

### Applications and Phenomena

1. **Mott Insulator**:
   At half-filling and in the strong coupling limit, the system can become a Mott insulator, where despite having partially filled bands, electron-electron interactions prevent conduction.

2. **Magnetism**:
   The Hubbard model can describe various magnetic phenomena. At half-filling and in the strong coupling limit, virtual hopping of electrons leads to an effective antiferromagnetic interaction between neighboring spins, which can be described by the Heisenberg model:
   $$
   \hat{H}_{\text{eff}} = J \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} \vec{S}_i \cdot \vec{S}_j
   $$
   where \(J \sim \frac{4t^2}{U}\) is the exchange interaction and \(\vec{S}_i\) is the spin operator at site \(i\).

3. **High-Temperature Superconductivity**:
   The Hubbard model, especially its extension to the t-J model, has been used to study high-temperature superconductivity in cuprate materials. The competition between kinetic energy and strong correlations is believed to play a critical role in the emergence of superconductivity.

### Solution Methods

1. **Exact Diagonalization**:
   This method involves numerically solving the Hubbard Hamiltonian for small lattice sizes by directly diagonalizing the Hamiltonian matrix. It is limited by the exponential growth of the Hilbert space with system size.

2. **Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC)**:
   QMC methods use stochastic sampling to evaluate the properties of the Hubbard model. These methods can handle larger systems but suffer from the "sign problem" at low temperatures and for certain parameter regimes.

3. **Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT)**:
   DMFT approximates the lattice problem by mapping it onto a self-consistent single-site problem. This method captures local correlations accurately and can be extended to include spatial correlations (cluster DMFT).

4. **Variational Methods**:
   Variational approaches, such as the Gutzwiller approximation or variational Monte Carlo, use trial wavefunctions to approximate the ground state of the Hubbard model.

### Extensions of the Hubbard Model

1. **Extended Hubbard Model**:
   Includes additional interaction terms such as nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsion and exchange interactions:
   $$
   \hat{H}_{\text{extended}} = \hat{H} + V \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} \hat{n}_i \hat{n}_j
   $$

2. **t-J Model**:
   Derived from the Hubbard model in the strong coupling limit, focusing on the physics of doped Mott insulators:
   $$
   \hat{H}_{t-J} = -t \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle, \sigma} (c_{i\sigma}^\dagger c_{j\sigma} + \text{H.c.}) + J \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} \vec{S}_i \cdot \vec{S}_j
   $$

### Conclusion

The Hubbard model is a fundamental model in [[condensed matter physics]], providing deep insights into the behavior of strongly correlated electron systems. Its simplicity allows for theoretical and numerical studies, yet it captures essential physics such as Mott insulating behavior, magnetism, and superconductivity. Extensions and modifications of the Hubbard model continue to be important tools for exploring complex phenomena in many-body physics.
