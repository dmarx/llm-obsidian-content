Tannaka–Krein duality


**ASSISTANT**

**Tannaka–Krein duality** is a powerful result in the theory of groups and their representations, which can be understood as a non-commutative generalization of Pontryagin duality. It provides a correspondence between compact groups (or, more generally, quantum groups) and certain categories of their representations. This duality lies at the heart of modern approaches to understanding groups via their actions on vector spaces, specifically through their representations.

The duality is named after Tadao Tannaka and Mark Krein, and their work bridges the study of group representations with abstract category theory. A central theme in Tannaka–Krein duality is reconstructing a group from its category of representations.

### Basic Setup: Representations of Compact Groups

Let \( G \) be a **compact topological group**, which could be abelian or non-abelian. The starting point for Tannaka–Krein duality is the observation that the structure of \( G \) is deeply encoded in its **category of representations**. A **representation** of \( G \) is a homomorphism from \( G \) to the group of automorphisms of a vector space, typically a finite-dimensional vector space over a field \( k \) (usually \( k = \mathbb{C} \)):

$$
\rho: G \to \text{GL}(V),
$$
where \( V \) is a vector space over \( k \).

The key observation is that by studying the **category of finite-dimensional representations** of \( G \), denoted as \( \mathcal{Rep}(G) \), one can reconstruct the group \( G \) itself. The category \( \mathcal{Rep}(G) \) consists of objects (the representations) and morphisms (intertwining operators between representations), which reflect the group's structure.

### Tannaka–Krein Duality: Reconstruction of the Group

The Tannaka–Krein duality theorem asserts that under certain conditions, one can **reconstruct the group** \( G \) from the category of its representations \( \mathcal{Rep}(G) \). More formally, there is an equivalence between the following two kinds of data:

1. **A compact group \( G \)** (up to isomorphism).
2. **A tensor category** with properties like \( \mathcal{Rep}(G) \), which is a rigid, symmetric monoidal category (meaning it has a natural tensor product structure, duals for objects, etc.).

#### Reconstruction Process

To reconstruct the group \( G \) from its category of representations, we use the concept of a **fiber functor**, which encodes information about how representations act on vector spaces.

- A **fiber functor** is a **monoidal functor** \( F: \mathcal{Rep}(G) \to \text{Vect}_k \), from the category of representations to the category of vector spaces over \( k \). This functor assigns to each representation \( \rho: G \to \text{GL}(V) \) its underlying vector space \( V \).

The essence of Tannaka–Krein duality is that, given the category of representations and such a fiber functor, we can reconstruct \( G \) as the group of **natural transformations** of this functor. Specifically, the group \( G \) is isomorphic to the group of automorphisms of the fiber functor \( F \):

$$
G \cong \text{Aut}^{\otimes}(F),
$$
where \( \text{Aut}^{\otimes}(F) \) is the group of automorphisms that preserve the tensor product structure (i.e., the way representations combine).

In other words, by examining how representations "act" on vector spaces (through the fiber functor), we can reverse-engineer the group structure.

### Example: Compact Lie Groups

For a compact Lie group \( G \), its category of representations \( \mathcal{Rep}(G) \) contains information about:

- **Irreducible representations**, which correspond to characters in the abelian case.
- **Intertwining operators**, which describe how different representations relate to each other.
  
Tannaka–Krein duality shows that by analyzing this category, one can reconstruct \( G \). This generalizes the classical Pontryagin duality from abelian groups, where the dual group is formed from the characters (which are irreducible representations in the abelian case).

### Tannaka–Krein Duality for Quantum Groups

Tannaka–Krein duality has been extended to the study of **quantum groups**, where the objects in the category \( \mathcal{Rep}(G) \) are representations of a quantum group rather than a classical group. In this case, the duality helps reconstruct the quantum group from the algebraic structure of its representation category. This is crucial in areas such as the theory of **Hopf algebras** and **[[non-commutative geometry]]**.

### Summary of Key Concepts

- **Representation Category \( \mathcal{Rep}(G) \)**: The category whose objects are representations of \( G \) and morphisms are intertwining operators between them.
- **Tensor Structure**: The category \( \mathcal{Rep}(G) \) has a tensor product, reflecting how the group acts on tensor products of representations.
- **Fiber Functor**: A functor from \( \mathcal{Rep}(G) \) to \( \text{Vect}_k \), capturing the vector space structure of representations.
- **Reconstruction**: The compact group \( G \) is isomorphic to the group of automorphisms of the fiber functor that preserve the tensor product.

### Applications

- **Non-commutative geometry**: Tannaka–Krein duality provides a way to study quantum groups and non-commutative spaces through their representation categories.
- **Lie group theory**: The duality helps analyze the structure of Lie groups by understanding their representation theory.
- **Algebraic geometry**: In the context of algebraic groups, Tannaka duality plays a crucial role in understanding the relationship between group schemes and their representations.

In summary, Tannaka–Krein duality is a categorical approach to understanding groups via their representations, and it plays a fundamental role in modern mathematical physics, representation theory, and [[non-commutative geometry]].
