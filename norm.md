**ASSISTANT**

In mathematics, a **norm** is a function that assigns a strictly positive length or size to all vectors in a vector space—except for the zero vector, which is assigned a length of zero. Norms are essential in various areas of mathematics, including linear algebra, analysis, and applied mathematics, because they provide a way to quantify the size or distance in a vector space. 

### Definition

Formally, a norm on a vector space $V$ over a [[field]] $\mathbb{F}$ (commonly $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$) is a function $\|\cdot\|: V \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ satisfying the following properties for all vectors $u, v \in V$ and all scalars $\alpha \in \mathbb{F}$:

1. **Non-negativity**: $\|v\| \geq 0$ with equality if and only if $v = 0$.
2. **Scalar Multiplication**: $\|\alpha v\| = |\alpha| \|v\|$, where $|\alpha|$ is the absolute value of $\alpha$.
3. **Triangle Inequality**: $\|u + v\| \leq \|u\| + \|v\|$. This states that the norm of the sum of two vectors is less than or equal to the sum of their norms.
4. **Definiteness**: $\|v\| = 0$ if and only if $v = 0$.

### Common Examples of Norms

- **Euclidean Norm (or 2-norm)**: On $\mathbb{R}^n$, the Euclidean norm is defined as $\|x\|_2 = \sqrt{x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \cdots + x_n^2}$, where $x = (x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$. This norm corresponds to the usual geometric length of a vector in $n$-dimensional space.

- **$p$-norm**: More generally, for $1 \leq p < \infty$, the $p$-norm (or Lp norm) is given by $\|x\|_p = (|x_1|^p + |x_2|^p + \cdots + |x_n|^p)^{\frac{1}{p}}$. The Euclidean norm is a special case where $p=2$. The case $p=1$ yields the **Manhattan Norm**, and as $p$ approaches infinity, the $p$-norm converges to the **Infinity Norm** ($\|x\|_\infty$), which is equal to $\max\{|x_1|, |x_2|, ..., |x_n|\}$.

- **Infinity Norm (or max norm)**: This norm measures the size of a vector as the maximum absolute value of its components: $\|x\|_\infty = \max_{i} |x_i|$.

### Properties and Applications

- **Metric**: A norm induces a metric (distance function) $d(u, v) = \|u - v\|$ on the vector space, which measures the distance between any two vectors $u$ and $v$.

- **Unit Sphere**: The set of all vectors with norm equal to one forms the unit sphere in the normed vector space. The shape of this sphere can vary significantly depending on the chosen norm.

- **Topological Structure**: Norms give a vector space a topological structure, allowing for the definition and analysis of concepts like convergence, continuity, and compactness within the space.

- **Applications**: Norms are widely used in numerical analysis to estimate errors, in functional analysis to study function spaces, and in optimization problems where one seeks to minimize or maximize some norm-related quantity.

In summary, norms are central to the structure of vector spaces and the study of linear algebra, providing a powerful way to quantify and compare elements within these spaces. Their versatility and utility extend across pure and applied mathematics, making them indispensable tools in both theoretical and practical contexts.
