# Lambda Diagrams

Lambda diagrams are visual representations of [[lambda calculus]] expressions that provide an intuitive way to understand the structure and execution of [[lambda terms]]. They help visualize the relationships between variables, abstractions, and applications in lambda expressions, making it easier to track [[variable binding]], [[scope]], and [[reduction steps]].

## Basic Notation

### Linear Notation

Before examining the diagrammatic representations, let's recall the standard linear notation for lambda calculus:

1. **Variables**: $x$, $y$, $z$, etc.
2. **Abstractions**: $\lambda x.M$ (a function with parameter $x$ and body $M$)
3. **Applications**: $(M \, N)$ (applying function $M$ to argument $N$)

### Tree Representation

The simplest lambda diagram is a **tree representation**:

- **Variables** are represented as leaf nodes labeled with the variable name
- **Abstractions** ($\lambda x.M$) are represented as nodes labeled $\lambda x$ with a single child for the body $M$
- **Applications** ($M \, N$) are represented as nodes labeled `@` with two children: the function $M$ and the argument $N$

Example: The lambda term $(\lambda x.(\lambda y.(x \, y)) \, z)$ as a tree:
```
    @
   / \
  λx   z
   |
   λy
   |
    @
   / \
  x   y
```

## De Bruijn Notation and Diagrams

### De Bruijn Indices

[[De Bruijn indices]] replace named variables with numeric indices that represent the number of lambda abstractions between the variable occurrence and its binder:

- The index 1 refers to the variable bound by the innermost enclosing lambda
- The index 2 refers to the variable bound by the next enclosing lambda, and so on

Example: $\lambda x.\lambda y.(x \, y)$ becomes $\lambda.\lambda.(2 \, 1)$

### De Bruijn Diagrams

De Bruijn diagrams represent lambda terms using a graph structure where:

- **Abstractions** are represented by nodes with one outgoing edge to the body
- **Applications** are represented by nodes with two outgoing edges (function and argument)
- **Variables** are represented by edges that connect back to their binding lambda (forming loops)

The key feature is that variables are represented by edges pointing back to their binding lambda, eliminating the need for variable names.

## Visual Lambda Notation

[[Visual lambda notation]], developed by [[Alain Marty]], uses geometric shapes to represent lambda expressions:

- **Variables**: Dots or small circles
- **Abstractions**: Enclosing rectangles or ovals with a "socket" (binding site)
- **Applications**: Connected components with function and argument regions

The binding relationship is represented by a line connecting a variable occurrence to its binding site (socket).

## Lambda Interaction Nets

[[Interaction nets]] provide another diagrammatic representation of lambda calculus that focuses on the dynamics of evaluation:

- **Agents**: Nodes with named ports
- **Wires**: Connections between ports

The reduction rules are expressed as graph rewriting operations:

- **Beta reduction**: Replacing a connection between abstraction and application agents with appropriate connections to the argument

This approach is closely related to [[linear logic]] and has applications in efficient implementation of [[functional programming languages]].

## String Diagrams

[[String diagrams]] from [[category theory]] can represent lambda terms by treating:

- Functions as boxes with input and output wires
- Variables as wires
- Abstraction as introducing a new input wire
- Application as connecting the output of one diagram to the input of another

These diagrams are particularly useful for visualizing [[typed lambda calculus]] in the context of [[cartesian closed categories]].

## Combinatory Logic Diagrams

[[Combinatory logic]] provides a variable-free formulation of lambda calculus using combinators like **S**, **K**, and **I**. Diagrams for combinatory logic represent:

- **Combinators** as labeled nodes
- **Applications** as connecting lines

The reduction rules for combinators are visualized as graph transformations:
- **I x** → **x**
- **K x y** → **x**
- **S x y z** → **x z (y z)**

## Visualization of Beta Reduction

Diagrams can effectively illustrate the process of [[beta reduction]]:

### Tree Transformation

In tree diagrams, beta reduction $(\lambda x.M) \, N \to_\beta M[x := N]$ is visualized as:
1. Identifying the application node connecting an abstraction and an argument
2. Replacing all occurrences of the bound variable in the abstraction body with copies of the argument subtree
3. Replacing the application node with the resulting transformed body

### Graph Reduction

In graph-based notations like De Bruijn diagrams or interaction nets, beta reduction is visualized as:
1. Redirecting edges that represented the bound variable
2. Connecting them to the argument node
3. Eliminating the abstraction and application nodes

This approach avoids the explicit copying required in tree transformations, making it more efficient for implementation.

## Applications of Lambda Diagrams

### Educational Tools

Lambda diagrams serve as powerful pedagogical tools for teaching:
- [[Lambda calculus basics]]
- [[Variable binding and scope]]
- [[Evaluation strategies]]
- [[Type systems]]

Visualizations help students develop intuition about abstract concepts in programming language theory.

### Implementation Techniques

Diagrams inspire efficient implementation techniques for [[functional programming languages]]:
- [[Graph reduction]] algorithms
- [[Optimal reduction]] strategies
- [[Garbage collection]] methods
- [[Parallelization]] of evaluation

### Formal Verification

Lambda diagrams support formal verification by:
- Providing visual representations of [[proof terms]]
- Illustrating [[normalization]] processes
- Connecting [[lambda calculus]] to [[proof theory]]
- Visualizing [[logical relations]]

## Formal Systems Based on Diagrams

### Proof Nets

[[Proof nets]] are diagrammatic representations of proofs in [[linear logic]] that have connections to lambda calculus:

- **Linear lambda terms** correspond to specific proof nets
- **Beta reduction** corresponds to cut elimination
- **Types** correspond to formulas

### Interaction Combinators

[[Interaction combinators]] provide a universal graphical formalism for computation based on just three types of agents and simple interaction rules.

This system can represent lambda calculus while providing a more uniform treatment of computation and resources.

## Mathematical Foundation

The correspondence between lambda terms and diagrams can be formalized using concepts from [[graph theory]] and [[category theory]]:

- **Binding graphs**: Directed graphs where edges represent binding relationships
- **Monoidal categories**: Categories with a tensor product operation that can model both sequential and parallel composition
- **Cartesian closed categories**: Categories with objects that represent function spaces, providing semantics for simply typed lambda calculus

## Notation Systems

Various formal notations have been developed for lambda diagrams:

### Linear Lambda Calculus Diagrams

For [[linear lambda calculus]] (where each variable is used exactly once), diagrams can be represented as:

$$\begin{align}
\text{Variable } x &: \circ \text{ labeled } x\\
\text{Abstraction } \lambda x.M &: \lambda x \to M \\
\text{Application } (M \, N) &: M \boxtimes N
\end{align}$$

### Categorical Notation

In the [[categorical approach]], lambda terms are represented using morphisms:

$$\begin{align}
\text{Variable } x_i &: \pi_i : A_1 \times \cdots \times A_n \to A_i \\
\text{Abstraction } \lambda x.M &: \Lambda(M) : \Gamma \to (A \Rightarrow B) \\
\text{Application } (M \, N) &: \text{eval} \circ \langle M, N \rangle : \Gamma \to B
\end{align}$$

where $\Lambda$ is the currying operation and $\text{eval}$ is the evaluation morphism.

## Implementation in Software

Lambda diagrams have been implemented in various software tools:

- [[Visual Lambda]] - Interactive environment for manipulating lambda terms
- [[Alligator]] - Graph-based implementation of functional programming
- [[LambdaScope]] - Educational tool for visualizing lambda calculus reduction
- [[ProofNet]] - Tool for constructing and analyzing proof nets

These tools leverage the visual nature of lambda diagrams to provide intuitive interfaces for working with lambda calculus and related formalisms.
