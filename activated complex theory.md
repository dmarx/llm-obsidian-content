# Activated Complex Theory

Activated Complex Theory (ACT) is a specialized formulation of [[Transition State Theory]] (TST) that focuses on the detailed properties of the [[activated complex]] – the transient, high-energy molecular configuration formed during a chemical reaction. Developed primarily by [[Henry Eyring]], this framework provides a mechanistic interpretation of reaction rates by examining the structure, energetics, and dynamics of this critical intermediate state.

## Fundamental Concept

The central concept of Activated Complex Theory is the formation of an [[activated complex]] (also called the [[transition state]]) – a metastable molecular arrangement poised between reactants and products. This complex represents a saddle point on the [[potential energy surface]], characterized by:

1. Maximum energy along the [[reaction coordinate]]
2. Stable vibrational modes in all directions perpendicular to the reaction coordinate
3. An unstable vibrational mode along the reaction coordinate (represented by an [[imaginary frequency]])

## Mathematical Formalism

### Absolute Rate Expression

Activated Complex Theory expresses the reaction rate constant in terms of molecular properties:

$$k = \kappa \frac{k_B T}{h} \frac{Q^{\ddagger}}{Q_R} e^{-E_0/RT}$$

Where:
- $\kappa$ is the [[transmission coefficient]] (accounts for recrossings)
- $k_B$ is the [[Boltzmann constant]]
- $T$ is the absolute temperature
- $h$ is [[Planck's constant]]
- $Q^{\ddagger}$ is the [[partition function]] of the activated complex (excluding the reaction coordinate)
- $Q_R$ is the partition function of the reactants
- $E_0$ is the [[activation energy]] at 0 K

### Partition Function Treatment

The partition function ratio can be expressed as a product of contributions from different molecular degrees of freedom:

$$\frac{Q^{\ddagger}}{Q_R} = \frac{q_{\text{trans}}^{\ddagger}}{q_{\text{trans}}^R} \cdot \frac{q_{\text{rot}}^{\ddagger}}{q_{\text{rot}}^R} \cdot \frac{q_{\text{vib}}^{\ddagger}}{q_{\text{vib}}^R} \cdot \frac{q_{\text{elec}}^{\ddagger}}{q_{\text{elec}}^R}$$

Where $q_{\text{trans}}$, $q_{\text{rot}}$, $q_{\text{vib}}$, and $q_{\text{elec}}$ represent translational, rotational, vibrational, and electronic partition functions, respectively.

## Structural Aspects of the Activated Complex

### Geometric Properties

The activated complex exhibits specific geometric features:

1. **[[Bond lengths]]**: Partially formed/broken bonds with lengths intermediate between reactants and products
2. **[[Bond angles]]**: Often distorted from equilibrium values
3. **[[Symmetry]]**: May have lower symmetry than either reactants or products
4. **[[Coordination]]**: Altered coordination numbers or hybridization states

### Electronic Structure

The electronic structure of the activated complex is characterized by:

1. **[[Orbital interactions]]**: Mixing or reorganization of molecular orbitals
2. **[[Electron density redistribution]]**: Regions of electron accumulation and depletion
3. **[[Correlation effects]]**: Often requiring advanced computational methods to describe accurately
4. **[[Frontier orbital interactions]]**: Critical HOMO-LUMO interactions governing reaction selectivity

## Thermodynamic Formulation

### Activation Parameters

Activated Complex Theory relates macroscopic activation parameters to the molecular properties of the activated complex:

$$\Delta G^{\ddagger} = \Delta H^{\ddagger} - T\Delta S^{\ddagger}$$

$$\Delta H^{\ddagger} = E_0 + \Delta(PV) + \Delta(\text{ZPE}) + \Delta(\text{thermal energy})$$

$$\Delta S^{\ddagger} = R\ln\left(\frac{Q^{\ddagger}}{Q_R}\right) + \text{thermal contributions}$$

Where:
- $\Delta G^{\ddagger}$ is the [[Gibbs free energy of activation]]
- $\Delta H^{\ddagger}$ is the [[enthalpy of activation]]
- $\Delta S^{\ddagger}$ is the [[entropy of activation]]
- $\Delta(\text{ZPE})$ represents the change in [[zero-point energy]]

### Iso-Kinetic Relationships

Activated Complex Theory predicts [[iso-kinetic relationships]] among families of related reactions:

$$\Delta H^{\ddagger} = \alpha + \beta\Delta S^{\ddagger}$$

Where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are constants for a given reaction series, and $\beta$ is the [[iso-kinetic temperature]].

## Dynamic Aspects

### Transmission Coefficient

The [[transmission coefficient]] $\kappa$ accounts for deviations from the idealized transition state theory:

$$\kappa = \frac{k_{\text{exact}}}{k_{\text{TST}}}$$

Factors affecting $\kappa$ include:
1. **[[Recrossing]]**: Trajectories that cross the dividing surface multiple times
2. **[[Quantum tunneling]]**: Passage through rather than over the energy barrier
3. **[[Non-equilibrium effects]]**: Breakdown of the equilibrium assumption
4. **[[Solvent dynamics]]**: Friction and cage effects in condensed phases

### Reaction Coordinate Dynamics

The motion along the [[reaction coordinate]] is treated specially in Activated Complex Theory:

1. **[[Vibrational to translational energy conversion]]**: As the system crosses the dividing surface
2. **[[Critical velocity]]**: Required to overcome the barrier and proceed to products
3. **[[Momentum conservation]]**: Governing the partitioning of energy in the products
4. **[[Mode coupling]]**: Between the reaction coordinate and other vibrational modes

## Extensions and Specialized Applications
