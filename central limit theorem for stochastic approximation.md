Central Limit Theorem for Stochastic Approximation


**ASSISTANT**

The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) for stochastic approximation (SA) provides an asymptotic distribution for the sequence of iterates produced by stochastic approximation algorithms. These results are crucial for understanding the convergence rate and the variability of the estimates produced by such algorithms.

### Stochastic Approximation Algorithm

Consider a stochastic approximation algorithm of the form:
$$ \theta_{k+1} = \theta_k + \gamma_k (h(\theta_k) + \zeta_k), $$
where:
- \( \theta_k \) is the current iterate.
- \( \gamma_k \) is the step size or learning rate.
- \( h(\theta_k) \) is a function representing the true gradient or update direction.
- \( \zeta_k \) is a noise term.

### Conditions for CLT

To establish the CLT for stochastic approximation, we typically assume:
1. **Step Size Conditions**:
   - \( \gamma_k \) satisfies \( \gamma_k \to 0 \) and \( \sum_{k=1}^\infty \gamma_k = \infty \).
   - Common choice: \( \gamma_k = \frac{\gamma_0}{k} \) for some \(\gamma_0 > 0\).

2. **Noise Conditions**:
   - The noise \(\zeta_k\) is a [[martingale difference sequence]] with respect to the filtration \(\mathcal{F}_k\) (the natural filtration generated by the iterates up to time \(k\)).
   - \( E[\zeta_k | \mathcal{F}_k] = 0 \) almost surely.
   - \( \text{Var}(\zeta_k | \mathcal{F}_k) < \infty \) almost surely.

3. **Regularity Conditions on \(h\)**:
   - \( h(\theta) \) is continuously differentiable.
   - There exists a \(\theta^*\) such that \( h(\theta^*) = 0 \).
   - The Jacobian matrix \( H = \nabla h(\theta^*) \) is negative definite.

### Statement of the CLT

Under these conditions, the sequence of iterates \( \theta_k \) produced by the stochastic approximation algorithm converges to \(\theta^*\) almost surely. Furthermore, the scaled error process converges in distribution to a normal distribution. Formally:

Let \( \theta_k \to \theta^* \) almost surely. Define the error term:
$$ e_k = \theta_k - \theta^*. $$

Then, the scaled error term \( \sqrt{k} e_k \) converges in distribution to a normal distribution:
$$ \sqrt{k} (\theta_k - \theta^*) \xrightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}(0, \Sigma), $$
where \(\Sigma\) is the asymptotic covariance matrix given by:
$$ \Sigma = \gamma_0 \left( 2 H^{-1} A (H^{-1})^T \right), $$
with \(H = \nabla h(\theta^*)\) and \(A\) being the asymptotic covariance of the noise term \(\zeta_k\):
$$ A = \lim_{k \to \infty} \text{Var}(\zeta_k). $$

### Intuition and Proof Sketch

1. **Linearization**:
   Near the optimum \(\theta^*\), the function \(h(\theta)\) can be approximated by its linearization:
   $$ h(\theta_k) \approx H (\theta_k - \theta^*). $$

2. **Martingale Approximation**:
   The noise term \(\zeta_k\) can be treated as a [[martingale difference sequence]]. This allows the use of martingale central limit theorems.

3. **Rescaling**:
   Rescale the error \(e_k\) by \(\sqrt{k}\) and analyze the resulting process. The scaled error process satisfies a recurrence relation that resembles a linear stochastic difference equation with martingale noise.

4. **Application of CLT for Martingales**:
   Use the central limit theorem for martingales to show that the scaled error process converges in distribution to a normal distribution.

### Applications

1. **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**:
   The CLT provides insights into the variability and distribution of the iterates produced by SGD. It helps in understanding the convergence behavior and in setting confidence intervals for the estimates.

2. **Parameter Estimation**:
   In adaptive control and signal processing, the CLT for SA algorithms helps in assessing the quality of parameter estimates obtained from recursive estimation methods.

3. **Optimization Algorithms**:
   The CLT is used to analyze the asymptotic behavior of optimization algorithms, especially those used in machine learning and econometrics.

### Example

Consider the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm for minimizing a convex function \(f(\theta)\) with gradient estimates:
$$ \theta_{k+1} = \theta_k - \gamma_k (\nabla f(\theta_k) + \zeta_k), $$
where \(\zeta_k\) represents the noise in the gradient estimate.

If \( \nabla f(\theta^*) = 0 \) at the minimum \(\theta^*\) and \(\nabla^2 f(\theta^*)\) is positive definite, then the scaled error \( \sqrt{k} (\theta_k - \theta^*) \) converges in distribution to a normal distribution with mean 0 and covariance matrix \(\Sigma\).
