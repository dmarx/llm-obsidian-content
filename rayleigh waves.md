### Rayleigh Waves

Rayleigh waves are a type of surface wave that travel along the surface of an elastic solid, such as the Earth. Named after Lord Rayleigh, who first predicted their existence in 1885, these waves are crucial in various fields, including seismology, materials science, and engineering. Rayleigh waves exhibit unique characteristics, such as elliptical particle motion, and play a significant role in the propagation of seismic energy during earthquakes.

#### Characteristics of Rayleigh Waves

1. **Elliptical Particle Motion**:
   - Particles in a Rayleigh wave move in elliptical paths in the vertical plane, perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation.
   - The motion is retrograde, meaning the particles move in the opposite direction to the wave at the surface.

2. **Surface Localization**:
   - Rayleigh waves decay exponentially with depth, making them most prominent at the surface.
   - The amplitude of Rayleigh waves decreases with depth according to an exponential factor $e^{-kz}$, where $k$ is the wave number and $z$ is the depth.

3. **Wave Speed**:
   - The speed of Rayleigh waves ($c_R$) is slightly less than the shear wave speed ($c_s$) in the same medium.
   - The exact speed depends on the material properties and is given by solving the Rayleigh wave dispersion equation.

#### Mathematical Modeling

The mathematical description of Rayleigh waves involves solving the equations of motion for an elastic solid. The key steps are:

1. **Equations of Motion**:
   - For an isotropic, homogeneous elastic medium, the equations of motion are given by:
     $$ \rho \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = ( \lambda + 2\mu ) \nabla (\nabla \cdot u) - \mu \nabla \times (\nabla \times u) $$
     where $\rho$ is the density, $\lambda$ and $\mu$ are the Lam√© parameters, and $u$ is the displacement vector.

2. **Boundary Conditions**:
   - At the free surface ($z = 0$), the stress components must vanish:
     $$ \sigma_{xz} = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \sigma_{zz} = 0 $$
   - These boundary conditions ensure that there is no normal or shear stress at the surface.

3. **Solution Ansatz**:
   - The displacement components can be expressed in terms of potential functions $\phi$ (scalar potential) and $\psi$ (vector potential):
     $$ u = \nabla \phi + \nabla \times \psi $$
   - For Rayleigh waves, $\psi$ is typically chosen to have only a component in the direction of propagation.

4. **Rayleigh Wave Equation**:
   - By substituting the potential functions into the equations of motion and applying the boundary conditions, we derive the Rayleigh wave equation.
   - The Rayleigh wave speed $c_R$ is found by solving the following characteristic equation:
     $$ (2 - \xi^2)^2 - 4 \sqrt{1 - \xi^2} \sqrt{1 - \frac{\xi^2}{2}} = 0 $$
     where $\xi = \frac{c_R}{c_s}$ is the normalized wave speed.

#### Applications

1. **Seismology**:
   - Rayleigh waves are a major component of seismic surface waves generated by earthquakes.
   - They are used to study the Earth's surface layers and to locate earthquake epicenters.

2. **Non-Destructive Testing**:
   - Rayleigh waves are employed to detect surface cracks and defects in materials.
   - Their sensitivity to surface conditions makes them ideal for evaluating the integrity of structures.

3. **Material Characterization**:
   - The speed and attenuation of Rayleigh waves provide information about the elastic properties and damping characteristics of materials.
   - They are used in geophysical surveys and engineering assessments.

4. **Engineering and Construction**:
   - Understanding Rayleigh wave propagation helps in designing foundations and structures that can withstand seismic surface waves.
   - They are considered in the [[seismic design]] and retrofitting of buildings.
