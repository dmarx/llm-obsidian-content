title: why does the svd give the optimal rotation

why does the SVD give the optimal rotation?


**ASSISTANT**

The use of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) in determining the optimal rotation matrix in Procrustes analysis is foundational, leveraging the orthogonality properties of the matrices involved. The primary objective in Procrustes analysis is to minimize the Frobenius norm of the difference between the matrix $X$ and the transformed matrix $Y$, specifically $||X - sYR||_F$, where $s$ is a scaling factor and $R$ is an orthogonal rotation matrix. We'll explore why SVD provides this optimal $R$ under the constraint that $R$ must be orthogonal.

### Mathematical Setup

Given matrices $X$ and $Y$ (both centered and $Y$ scaled), we seek the matrix $R$ that minimizes the Procrustes distance:

$$d_P(X, Y) = \min_{R} \|X - YR\|_F$$

To minimize this distance, it's equivalent to maximizing the trace of $X^T Y R$, as the Frobenius norm and the trace operator are linked through the identity:

$$\|X - YR\|_F^2 = \|X\|_F^2 + \|YR\|_F^2 - 2 \text{tr}(X^T Y R)$$

Since $\|YR\|_F = \|Y\|_F$ due to the orthogonality of $R$, maximizing $\text{tr}(X^T Y R)$ maximizes the alignment of $X$ and $YR$.

### Application of SVD

The singular value decomposition of $X^T Y$ is given by:

$$X^T Y = U \Sigma V^T$$

Here, $U$ and $V$ are orthogonal matrices containing the left and right singular vectors of $X^T Y$, and $\Sigma$ is a diagonal matrix containing the singular values. The product $U \Sigma V^T$ represents the optimal "stretching" of the axes to align $X$ and $Y$ as closely as possible under linear transformation.

### Deriving the Optimal Rotation

To find the rotation matrix $R$, we use the fact that maximizing $\text{tr}(X^T Y R)$ is equivalent to maximizing $\text{tr}(U \Sigma V^T R)$. The rotation matrix $R$ that maximizes this trace can be shown to be:

$$R = V U^T$$

Hereâ€™s why this $R$ is optimal:

1. **Orthogonality**: Both $U$ and $V$ are orthogonal matrices. The product of two orthogonal matrices is also an orthogonal matrix, hence $R = V U^T$ is orthogonal.

2. **Trace Maximization**: The trace function under rotation is maximized when the columns of $V$ (from $X^T Y$) are aligned with the columns of $U^T$ (from $R$). This alignment maximizes the sum of the diagonal entries (the trace) of $V^T R U$, which by the properties of trace and the diagonal dominance of $\Sigma$, is maximized under the chosen $R$.

3. **Frobenius Norm Minimization**: This alignment effectively maximizes the sum of the squared singular values (which are the diagonal entries of $\Sigma$), thereby minimizing the Frobenius norm difference $\|X - YR\|_F$.

This utilization of SVD in determining $R$ ensures that the transformation of $Y$ to align with $X$ is optimal in terms of least-squares error, satisfying the conditions necessary for optimal alignment in Procrustes analysis. The outcome is a mathematically elegant and computationally efficient solution to the rotation problem in shape analysis.
