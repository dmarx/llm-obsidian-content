the standard model lagrangian


**ASSISTANT**

The **Standard Model Lagrangian** is the mathematical formulation that describes the fundamental interactions of elementary particles, encapsulating the electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces within a single framework. The Standard Model (SM) is a quantum field theory based on the gauge group $SU(3)_C \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$, which represents the symmetries associated with the strong interaction (quantum chromodynamics, or QCD) and the electroweak interaction (which unifies the electromagnetic and weak interactions).

### Components of the Standard Model Lagrangian

The Standard Model Lagrangian can be broken down into several key parts:

1. **Gauge Fields and their Kinetic Terms**: Describes the dynamics of the gauge bosons, which mediate the fundamental forces.
2. **Matter Fields**: Represents the fermions (quarks and leptons) that constitute matter.
3. **Yukawa Interactions**: Interactions between the Higgs field and fermions, which give rise to fermion masses.
4. **Higgs Field and Electroweak Symmetry Breaking**: Includes the Higgs potential and kinetic terms, leading to spontaneous symmetry breaking.
5. **Gauge Fixing and Ghost Terms**: Required to quantize the theory in a consistent manner (in the context of gauge theories).

### The Complete Standard Model Lagrangian

The full Standard Model Lagrangian is quite extensive, but it can be schematically written as:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{SM}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{gauge}} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{fermion}} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{Higgs}} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{Yukawa}},
$$

where:

- $\mathcal{L}_{\text{gauge}}$ describes the kinetic terms for the gauge fields.
- $\mathcal{L}_{\text{fermion}}$ includes the kinetic terms for the fermion fields and their interactions with gauge fields.
- $\mathcal{L}_{\text{Higgs}}$ contains the kinetic and potential terms for the Higgs field.
- $\mathcal{L}_{\text{Yukawa}}$ describes the Yukawa interactions that generate fermion masses after electroweak symmetry breaking.

Letâ€™s go through each of these components in more detail.

### 1. Gauge Fields and their Kinetic Terms

The gauge field Lagrangian describes the dynamics of the gauge bosons, which are the force carriers in the Standard Model:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{gauge}} = -\frac{1}{4} F^a_{\mu \nu} F^{a \, \mu \nu} - \frac{1}{4} W^i_{\mu \nu} W^{i \, \mu \nu} - \frac{1}{4} B_{\mu \nu} B^{\mu \nu}.
$$

Here:

- $F^a_{\mu \nu}$: The field strength tensor for the gluons associated with the $SU(3)_C$ gauge group (quantum chromodynamics). It is defined as $F^a_{\mu \nu} = \partial_\mu G^a_\nu - \partial_\nu G^a_\mu + g_s f^{abc} G^b_\mu G^c_\nu$, where $G^a_\mu$ are the gluon fields, $g_s$ is the strong coupling constant, and $f^{abc}$ are the structure constants of $SU(3)$.
- $W^i_{\mu \nu}$: The field strength tensor for the $SU(2)_L$ gauge bosons (the weak interaction), defined as $W^i_{\mu \nu} = \partial_\mu W^i_\nu - \partial_\nu W^i_\mu + g \epsilon^{ijk} W^j_\mu W^k_\nu$, where $W^i_\mu$ are the weak gauge boson fields, $g$ is the weak coupling constant, and $\epsilon^{ijk}$ are the structure constants of $SU(2)$.
- $B_{\mu \nu}$: The field strength tensor for the $U(1)_Y$ gauge boson (hypercharge gauge field), given by $B_{\mu \nu} = \partial_\mu B_\nu - \partial_\nu B_\mu$, where $B_\mu$ is the gauge field for the hypercharge $Y$ and $g'$ is the $U(1)_Y$ coupling constant.

### 2. Fermion Fields and their Kinetic Terms

The fermion Lagrangian describes the dynamics of the quarks and leptons and their interactions with the gauge fields:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{fermion}} = \sum_{\text{generations}} \left( \overline{Q}_L i \gamma^\mu D_\mu Q_L + \overline{u}_R i \gamma^\mu D_\mu u_R + \overline{d}_R i \gamma^\mu D_\mu d_R + \overline{L}_L i \gamma^\mu D_\mu L_L + \overline{e}_R i \gamma^\mu D_\mu e_R \right).
$$

Here:

- $Q_L = \begin{pmatrix} u_L \\ d_L \end{pmatrix}$: The left-handed quark doublet for each generation.
- $L_L = \begin{pmatrix} \nu_L \\ e_L \end{pmatrix}$: The left-handed lepton doublet for each generation.
- $u_R$, $d_R$, $e_R$: The right-handed up quark, down quark, and electron singlets, respectively.
- $D_\mu$: The covariant derivative, which introduces interactions with gauge fields and is given by:

$$
D_\mu = \partial_\mu + i g_s T^a G^a_\mu + i g \frac{\tau^i}{2} W^i_\mu + i g' \frac{Y}{2} B_\mu,
$$

where $T^a$ are the generators of $SU(3)_C$, $\tau^i$ are the generators of $SU(2)_L$, and $Y$ is the hypercharge.

### 3. Higgs Field and Electroweak Symmetry Breaking

The Higgs field Lagrangian includes the kinetic term for the Higgs field, its self-interactions, and the mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{Higgs}} = (D_\mu \Phi)^\dagger (D^\mu \Phi) - V(\Phi).
$$

Here:

- $\Phi$ is the Higgs doublet, which is a complex scalar field:

$$
\Phi = \begin{pmatrix} \phi^+ \\ \phi^0 \end{pmatrix}.
$$

- $V(\Phi)$ is the Higgs potential:

$$
V(\Phi) = \mu^2 \Phi^\dagger \Phi + \lambda (\Phi^\dagger \Phi)^2.
$$

The parameters $\mu^2$ and $\lambda$ determine the nature of the Higgs field's spontaneous symmetry breaking. If $\mu^2 < 0$, the Higgs field acquires a nonzero vacuum expectation value (vev), leading to the breaking of the $SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$ symmetry down to the $U(1)_{\text{em}}$ of electromagnetism.

### 4. Yukawa Interactions

The Yukawa Lagrangian describes interactions between the Higgs field and fermions, which generate masses for the fermions after the Higgs field acquires a nonzero vev:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{Yukawa}} = - \sum_{i,j} \left( Y^u_{ij} \overline{Q}_{L_i} \tilde{\Phi} u_{R_j} + Y^d_{ij} \overline{Q}_{L_i} \Phi d_{R_j} + Y^e_{ij} \overline{L}_{L_i} \Phi e_{R_j} + \text{h.c.} \right).
$$

Here:

- $Y^u_{ij}$, $Y^d_{ij}$, and $Y^e_{ij}$ are the Yukawa coupling matrices for the up-type quarks, down-type quarks, and charged leptons, respectively.
- $\tilde{\Phi} = i \tau_2 \Phi^* = \begin{pmatrix} \phi^{0*} \\ -\phi^- \end{pmatrix}$ is the conjugate Higgs doublet.
- After spontaneous symmetry breaking, where $\Phi$ acquires a vev $\langle \Phi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ v \end{pmatrix}$ with $v \approx 246$ GeV, these interactions give mass to the fermions:

$$
m_f = \frac{Y_f v}{\sqrt{2}}.
$$

### Full Standard Model Lagrangian

Combining all components, the full Standard Model Lagrangian is:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{SM}} &= -\frac{1}{4} F^a_{\mu \nu} F^{a \, \mu \nu} - \frac{1}{4} W^i_{\mu \nu
