Beta Function


**ASSISTANT**

The beta function is a crucial concept in quantum field theory and the renormalization group, describing how the coupling constants of a theory change with the energy scale. It provides insight into the behavior of a theory at different energy scales, including phenomena such as asymptotic freedom and infrared fixed points.

## Overview

### Definition

The beta function \(\beta(g)\) for a coupling constant \(g\) is defined as:

$$
\beta(g) = \mu \frac{d g}{d \mu}
$$

where \(\mu\) is the energy scale (or renormalization scale). The beta function governs the running of the coupling constant as the energy scale changes.

### Significance

- **Asymptotic Freedom**: If \(\beta(g) < 0\) for large \(g\), the coupling constant decreases with increasing energy, leading to weak coupling at high energies. This is a key feature of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).
- **Infrared Fixed Points**: If \(\beta(g) = 0\) at some non-zero \(g = g^*\), the coupling constant remains constant at this value as the energy scale changes, indicating a fixed point of the theory.

## Calculation

### Perturbative Expansion

In perturbation theory, the beta function is typically expanded in powers of the coupling constant:

$$
\beta(g) = \beta_0 g^3 + \beta_1 g^5 + \beta_2 g^7 + \cdots
$$

The coefficients \(\beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_2, \ldots\) depend on the specific quantum field theory and are computed from Feynman diagrams.

### Example: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)

For QED, the beta function to one-loop order is:

$$
\beta(e) = \frac{e^3}{12\pi^2}
$$

where \(e\) is the electric charge. This positive beta function indicates that the electric charge increases logarithmically with energy, a phenomenon known as the Landau pole.

### Example: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)

For QCD with \(n_f\) quark flavors, the beta function to one-loop order is:

$$
\beta(g) = -\frac{g^3}{16\pi^2} \left( 11 - \frac{2}{3} n_f \right)
$$

where \(g\) is the strong coupling constant. For \(n_f \leq 16\), the coefficient of \(g^3\) is negative, indicating asymptotic freedom.

### Higher-Order Corrections

The beta function can be computed to higher orders in perturbation theory. For example, the two-loop beta function for QCD is:

$$
\beta(g) = -\frac{g^3}{16\pi^2} \left( 11 - \frac{2}{3} n_f \right) - \frac{g^5}{(16\pi^2)^2} \left( 102 - \frac{38}{3} n_f \right)
$$

## Renormalization Group Equations

The running of the coupling constant with the energy scale is described by the renormalization group equation (RGE):

$$
\mu \frac{d g}{d \mu} = \beta(g)
$$

Solving this differential equation provides the running coupling constant \(g(\mu)\) as a function of the energy scale \(\mu\).

### Asymptotic Freedom in QCD

For QCD, solving the RGE with the one-loop beta function gives:

$$
g^2(\mu) = \frac{g^2(\mu_0)}{1 + \frac{b_0 g^2(\mu_0)}{(4\pi)^2} \ln \left( \frac{\mu}{\mu_0} \right)}
$$

where \(b_0 = 11 - \frac{2}{3} n_f\). This shows that \(g(\mu) \to 0\) as \(\mu \to \infty\), confirming asymptotic freedom.

### Landau Pole in QED

For QED, solving the RGE with the one-loop beta function gives:

$$
e^2(\mu) = \frac{e^2(\mu_0)}{1 - \frac{e^2(\mu_0)}{12\pi^2} \ln \left( \frac{\mu}{\mu_0} \right)}
$$

This indicates that \(e(\mu)\) increases with \(\mu\) and becomes infinite at a finite energy scale, known as the Landau pole.

## Applications

### Running Coupling Constants

The beta function allows the calculation of how coupling constants evolve with energy, providing essential insights into the behavior of fundamental forces at different scales.

### Quantum Field Theory

Understanding the beta function and the associated RG flows is crucial for studying the high-energy (UV) and low-energy (IR) behavior of quantum field theories.

### Critical Phenomena

In statistical mechanics, the beta function describes the flow of coupling constants near critical points, providing insights into [[critical phenomena]] and phase transitions.
