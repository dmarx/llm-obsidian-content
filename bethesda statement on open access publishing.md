Bethesda Statement on Open Access Publishing


**ASSISTANT**

The [[Bethesda Statement on Open Access Publishing]] is a pivotal document that outlines specific principles and guidelines for open access publishing. The statement emerged from a meeting held in April 2003, convened by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) in Bethesda, Maryland. This meeting brought together stakeholders from various sectors, including scientists, publishers, and advocates, to discuss and promote open access to scholarly literature.

### Key Principles of the Bethesda Statement

#### Definition of Open Access Publication
The statement defines an open access publication as one that meets the following two conditions:

1. **Free Accessibility**:
   - The publication is freely available on the public internet, permitting any users to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of these articles, crawl them for indexing, pass them as data to software, or use them for any other lawful purpose, without financial, legal, or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to the internet itself.

2. **Rights to Use and Reuse**:
   - The author(s) and copyright holder(s) grant to all users a free, irrevocable, worldwide, perpetual right of access to, and a license to copy, use, distribute, transmit, and display the work publicly and to make and distribute derivative works, in any digital medium for any responsible purpose, subject to proper attribution of authorship.

#### Responsibilities of Stakeholders

The Bethesda Statement outlines the responsibilities of various stakeholders to achieve and support open access:

1. **Authors**:
   - Authors should deposit a complete version of their work in a suitable open access repository immediately upon publication. This includes final peer-reviewed manuscripts.

2. **Institutions and Funders**:
   - Institutions and funding agencies should establish policies that require their researchers to deposit their peer-reviewed articles in open access repositories. They should also support the development of these repositories and provide funding for open access publishing costs.

3. **Libraries**:
   - Libraries should advocate for open access, help develop and maintain repositories, and support open access publishing initiatives.

4. **Publishers**:
   - Publishers should convert their journals to open access, eliminate subscription barriers, and provide licensing that permits unrestricted use and reuse of their published content.

### Implementation Strategies

#### Open Access Repositories
Encouraging the establishment and maintenance of open access repositories where authors can deposit their work. Examples include institutional repositories and subject-specific repositories like [[arXiv]] and [[PubMed Central]].

#### Support for Open Access Journals
Promoting and supporting the creation and sustainability of open access journals that do not charge subscription fees. This includes exploring various funding models, such as:

- **Article Processing Charges (APCs)**: Where the cost of publishing is covered by fees paid by authors or their institutions.
- **Institutional and Government Funding**: Where funding bodies and institutions cover publishing costs to ensure open access.
- **Sponsorship and Subsidies**: Financial support from organizations, societies, and philanthropic entities.

### Impact of the Bethesda Statement

#### Policy Development
The Bethesda Statement has influenced the development of open access policies by research institutions, funding agencies, and governments. Many have adopted mandates requiring open access to the research they fund, aligning with the principles of the Bethesda Statement.

#### Advocacy and Awareness
The statement has played a crucial role in raising awareness about the importance of open access and has been a significant advocacy tool in promoting the open dissemination of scholarly work.

#### Growth of Open Access Resources
Following the Bethesda Statement, there has been a notable increase in the number of open access journals and repositories, contributing to a more open and accessible research landscape.

### Challenges and Ongoing Efforts
Despite the progress facilitated by the Bethesda Statement, challenges remain:

- **Sustainable Funding**: Developing and maintaining sustainable funding models for open access publishing.
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensuring high standards of peer review and avoiding the proliferation of predatory journals.
- **Equity in Publishing**: Addressing the financial barriers that APCs can create for researchers from less wealthy institutions or countries.
