## Simultaneous Multiple Round Auction (SMRA)

The **Simultaneous Multiple Round Auction (SMRA)** is a widely used auction format for selling multiple related items, such as spectrum licenses. It allows bidders to bid on multiple items simultaneously over several rounds, providing transparency and enabling strategic bidding based on current prices and competitors' actions.

### Key Features of SMRA

1. **Simultaneity**: All items are auctioned simultaneously, allowing bidders to bid on multiple items in the same round.
2. **Multiple Rounds**: The auction proceeds in multiple rounds, giving bidders the opportunity to observe prices and adjust their bids.
3. **Ascending Bids**: Prices increase in each round based on the highest bids received in the previous round.
4. **Transparency**: Bidders have visibility into the current highest bids, enabling informed bidding decisions.

### Auction Process

#### Initialization

- **Starting Prices**: Each item (e.g., spectrum license) has a starting price set by the auctioneer.
- **Activity Rules**: Rules that require bidders to be active in a certain percentage of the items they are interested in to maintain eligibility in future rounds.

#### Bidding Rounds

1. **Bidding Phase**:
   - In each round, bidders submit their bids for one or more items.
   - Bids must be higher than the current highest bid plus a minimum increment.
2. **Provisionally Winning Bids**:
   - At the end of each round, the highest bid on each item is recorded as the provisionally winning bid.
   - Provisionally winning bidders must maintain their bids in subsequent rounds unless outbid.
3. **Price Adjustment**:
   - The auctioneer adjusts the prices based on the highest bids, setting new minimum bid levels for the next round.
4. **Bidder Information**:
   - Bidders are informed of the highest bids and identities of provisionally winning bidders (unless the auction is conducted anonymously).

#### Termination

- The auction continues until no new bids are placed on any item.
- The items are awarded to the highest bidders at the final bid prices.

### Example

Consider an SMRA for three spectrum licenses (A, B, and C) with three bidders (X, Y, and Z). The auction proceeds as follows:

#### Round 1:
- **Starting Prices**: $100 each.
- **Bids**: 
  - Bidder X bids $110 for A.
  - Bidder Y bids $120 for B.
  - Bidder Z bids $130 for C.

#### Round 2:
- **New Minimum Prices**: $110 for A, $120 for B, $130 for C.
- **Bids**:
  - Bidder X bids $140 for B.
  - Bidder Y bids $150 for C.
  - Bidder Z bids $160 for A.

#### Round 3:
- **New Minimum Prices**: $160 for A, $140 for B, $150 for C.
- **Bids**:
  - Bidder X bids $170 for A.
  - Bidder Y bids $180 for B.
  - Bidder Z does not place any new bids.

#### Termination:
- No new bids are placed, so the auction ends.
- Final Winners:
  - A: Bidder X at $170
  - B: Bidder Y at $180
  - C: Bidder Y at $150 (since Bidder Z did not outbid in the final round)

### Strategic Considerations

1. **Price Discovery**: Multiple rounds allow bidders to discover the value of items through observed bids.
2. **Switching**: Bidders can switch their bids to different items based on price movements and strategic considerations.
3. **Budget Constraints**: Bidders must manage their budgets and adjust their strategies accordingly to maximize their utility.

### Advantages of SMRA

1. **Efficiency**: Allocates items to the bidders who value them most, promoting efficient resource allocation.
2. **Transparency**: Bidders have visibility into the bidding process, leading to informed decision-making.
3. **Flexibility**: Bidders can adjust their bids across items based on their valuations and competitors' actions.

### Challenges and Limitations

1. **Complexity**: The multi-round format and simultaneous bidding on multiple items can be complex for bidders.
2. **Collusion Risks**: Bidders may attempt to collude to keep prices low, although transparency can also deter collusion.
3. **Exposure Problem**: Bidders may win some but not all of the items they need, leading to suboptimal outcomes. This is particularly relevant in auctions where items are complements.

### Applications

SMRA is extensively used in spectrum auctions by governments worldwide. Notable examples include:

- **FCC Spectrum Auctions**: The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the U.S. uses SMRA to allocate spectrum licenses.
- **European Spectrum Auctions**: Various European countries have used SMRA for auctioning 4G and 5G spectrum licenses.

### Conclusion

The Simultaneous Multiple Round Auction is a powerful and flexible auction format that supports efficient allocation of multiple related items. Its transparency and dynamic bidding process make it suitable for complex auctions like spectrum sales.
