wasserstein geometry


**ASSISTANT**

Wasserstein geometry is a mathematical framework that arises from the theory of optimal transport. It provides a way to measure distances between probability distributions, which is particularly useful in various fields like statistics, machine learning, and economics. The geometry is defined by the **Wasserstein distance** (also known as the **Earth Mover's Distance**), a metric that quantifies the minimum cost required to transform one probability distribution into another.

### 1. **Wasserstein Distance: Definition and Formulation**

Given two probability measures $\mu$ and $\nu$ on a metric space $(\mathcal{X}, d)$, where $d(x, y)$ represents the distance between points $x, y \in \mathcal{X}$, the $p$-th Wasserstein distance $W_p(\mu, \nu)$ for $p \geq 1$ is defined as:

$$
W_p(\mu, \nu) = \left( \inf_{\gamma \in \Pi(\mu, \nu)} \int_{\mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{X}} d(x, y)^p \, d\gamma(x, y) \right)^{1/p},
$$

where:
- $\Pi(\mu, \nu)$ is the set of all *couplings* of $\mu$ and $\nu$. A coupling $\gamma$ is a measure on the product space $\mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{X}$ with marginals $\mu$ and $\nu$, i.e., $\gamma(A \times \mathcal{X}) = \mu(A)$ and $\gamma(\mathcal{X} \times B) = \nu(B)$ for all measurable sets $A, B \subseteq \mathcal{X}$.
- The cost function $d(x, y)^p$ represents the "effort" required to move mass from $x$ to $y$.

For $p = 1$, this is the **first Wasserstein distance**, and for $p = 2$, it is the **second Wasserstein distance**. The case $p = 2$ is often preferred in applications because of its strong connection to Euclidean geometry and its computational properties.

### 2. **Optimal Transport Problem and Geodesics**

The Wasserstein distance originates from the **optimal transport problem**, which was first formulated by Gaspard Monge in 1781. The problem is to find the most cost-effective way to transport mass (represented by $\mu$) to another distribution of mass (represented by $\nu$). The formulation above using couplings $\gamma$ is known as the **Kantorovich formulation**.

In the context of Wasserstein geometry, the **geodesics** or the shortest paths between two probability measures are of interest. A geodesic $(\mu_t)_{t \in [0,1]}$ in the Wasserstein space $(\mathcal{P}_p(\mathcal{X}), W_p)$ connects two measures $\mu_0$ and $\mu_1$. For the case of $W_2$, this geodesic can often be explicitly computed when $\mathcal{X}$ is $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\mu_0$ and $\mu_1$ are absolutely continuous measures.

### 3. **Wasserstein Space: Metric Space Structure**

The space $\mathcal{P}_p(\mathcal{X})$ of probability measures with finite $p$-th moments, equipped with the $p$-th Wasserstein distance $W_p$, forms a metric space known as the **Wasserstein space**. Some key properties of this space include:

- **Non-negativity**: $W_p(\mu, \nu) \geq 0$ and $W_p(\mu, \nu) = 0$ if and only if $\mu = \nu$.
- **Symmetry**: $W_p(\mu, \nu) = W_p(\nu, \mu)$.
- **Triangle inequality**: $W_p(\mu, \nu) \leq W_p(\mu, \lambda) + W_p(\lambda, \nu)$ for any probability measure $\lambda$.
- **Convexity**: The Wasserstein space is a geodesic space, meaning that any two points (probability measures) can be connected by a geodesic along which the distance function is convex.

### 4. **Applications and Importance**

Wasserstein geometry has several important applications:

- **Machine Learning**: In domains like generative modeling (e.g., Generative Adversarial Networks with the Wasserstein loss, or WGANs), where minimizing the Wasserstein distance between data and generated distributions improves training stability and convergence.
- **Statistics**: Provides a framework for comparing distributions, such as in empirical processes, robust statistics, and hypothesis testing.
- **Economics and Game Theory**: Optimal transport problems often model economic scenarios involving resource allocation and cost minimization.
- **Physics and Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)**: Wasserstein metrics are used in the study of gradient flows in the space of probability measures, particularly in the analysis of PDEs like the Fokker-Planck equation.

### 5. **Connection to Other Geometrical Concepts**

Wasserstein geometry is closely related to several other geometric and analytical concepts:

- **Riemannian Geometry**: The Wasserstein space can be endowed with a Riemannian-like structure, especially for $W_2$, leading to a rich interplay with Riemannian geometry.
- **Entropy and Information Geometry**: The geometry also connects with concepts like entropy and divergence measures (e.g., Kullback-Leibler divergence, which does not generally define a metric but has a connection to Wasserstein distance through certain inequalities).

### 6. **Computational Aspects**

Computing the Wasserstein distance exactly is challenging, especially for high-dimensional data. However, several approximation algorithms and computational techniques, such as the Sinkhorn algorithm (using entropy regularization), have been developed to make these computations more tractable.

### 7. **Theoretical Insights and Further Reading**

The study of Wasserstein geometry extends to advanced topics such as:

- **Gradient flows in Wasserstein spaces**: Understanding the behavior of distributions over time under a gradient flow defined by an energy functional.
- **Regularity theory and stability**: Examining the regularity of optimal transport maps and their stability under perturbations of the measures.
