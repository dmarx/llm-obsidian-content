# Thermodynamic Depth

[[Thermodynamic depth]] is a complexity measure proposed by [[Charles Bennett]] that attempts to quantify the amount of computational history inherent in a physical state. It diverges from traditional [[entropy]] measures by focusing on the complexity of processes rather than states.

## Formal Definition

The thermodynamic depth D(x) of a state x is defined as:

D(x) = min{K(h) : h ∈ H(x)}

where:
- H(x) is the set of all possible histories leading to state x
- K(h) is the [[Kolmogorov complexity]] of history h
- min{} selects the simplest (least complex) possible history

## Conceptual Framework

### Historical Ensemble

For any macroscopic state x, we define its [[historical ensemble]] E(x) as:

E(x) = {(h_i, p_i)} 

where:
- h_i represents a possible microscopic history
- p_i is the probability of that history
- ∑p_i = 1

### Depth vs. Entropy

The key distinction between depth and [[thermodynamic entropy]] S can be formalized as:

1. S(x) = -∑p_i log(p_i) 
2. D(x) = min{K(h_i) : p_i > 0}

This highlights that:
- Entropy measures state complexity
- Depth measures process complexity

## Properties

### Fundamental Characteristics

1. **Non-decreasing under physical evolution**:
   D(f(x)) ≥ D(x) for any physical process f

2. **Bounded by physical resources**:
   D(x) ≤ poly(V, T, E) where:
   - V is volume
   - T is time
   - E is energy

3. **Independence of representation**:
   D(x) = D(y) + O(1) for any equivalent representations x, y

### [[Thermodynamic Arrow]]

Depth provides a computational foundation for the arrow of time:

1. Simple initial conditions have low depth
2. Complex evolved states have high depth
3. The difference D(x_t) - D(x_0) quantifies emergence of complexity

## Applications

### Physical Systems

1. **Crystal Formation**
   - Initial gas: Low depth
   - Crystal: High depth
   - D(crystal) reflects assembly process complexity

2. **Biological Evolution**
   - Simple replicators: Low depth
   - Complex organisms: High depth
   - D(organism) captures evolutionary history

### Computational Systems

The depth of a computation C can be formalized as:

D(C) = min{|p| : U(p) simulates C}

where:
- |p| is program length
- U is a universal Turing machine

## Relationship to Other Measures

### [[Logical Depth]]

Logical depth L(x) differs from thermodynamic depth in focusing on computation time:

L(x) = min{t : U(p) outputs x in time t, |p| ≈ K(x)}

### [[Statistical Complexity]]

Statistical complexity C(x) measures pattern information:

C(x) = I(past:future)

where I is mutual information between past and future observations.

## Mathematical Structure

### Depth Spectrum

The [[depth spectrum]] S(x,ε) generalizes basic depth:

S(x,ε) = min{K(h) : P(h|x) > ε}

where:
- ε is a significance threshold
- P(h|x) is the conditional probability of history h given state x

### Depth Rate

The [[depth rate]] r(x) measures complexity accumulation:

r(x) = lim_{t→∞} D(x_t)/t

where x_t represents the state at time t.

## Open Questions

1. Relationship between thermodynamic depth and [[computational irreducibility]]
2. Role of quantum effects in depth accumulation
3. Connection to [[integrated information theory]]
4. Formal relationship to [[physical complexity]]
5. Application to [[emergence]] and [[self-organization]]
