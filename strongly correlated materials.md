**USER**

strongly correlated materials


**ASSISTANT**

Strongly correlated materials are a class of materials where interactions between electrons are so significant that they cannot be described accurately by conventional theories, such as band theory or Fermi liquid theory. These interactions lead to a rich variety of physical phenomena, including high-temperature superconductivity, metal-insulator transitions, heavy fermion behavior, and quantum magnetism.

## Overview

### Characteristics of Strongly Correlated Materials

1. **Strong Electron-Electron Interactions**: The Coulomb repulsion between electrons is comparable to or greater than their kinetic energy.
2. **Emergent Phenomena**: The interactions give rise to complex collective behavior that cannot be understood by considering electrons individually.
3. **Breakdown of Conventional Theories**: Traditional methods like [[density functional theory]] (DFT) in its standard form often fail to capture the physics of these systems accurately.

### Examples of Strongly Correlated Materials

1. **Transition Metal Oxides**: Such as the cuprates (high-temperature superconductors) and manganites (colossal magnetoresistance materials).
2. **Heavy Fermion Compounds**: Containing elements like cerium (Ce), ytterbium (Yb), and uranium (U), exhibiting large effective electron masses.
3. **Organic Conductors**: Such as the Bechgaard salts, which show diverse phases including superconductivity and magnetism.
4. **Actinide Compounds**: Such as URu$_2$Si$_2$ and PuCoGa$_5$, which exhibit unconventional superconductivity and complex magnetic order.

## Theoretical Models

### Hubbard Model

The Hubbard model is one of the simplest and most widely used models for studying strongly correlated electrons:

$$
H = -t \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle, \sigma} (c_{i\sigma}^\dagger c_{j\sigma} + \text{H.c.}) + U \sum_i n_{i\uparrow} n_{i\downarrow}
$$

where:
- \( t \) is the hopping parameter,
- \( U \) is the on-site Coulomb repulsion,
- \( c_{i\sigma}^\dagger \) and \( c_{i\sigma} \) are the creation and annihilation operators for electrons with spin \(\sigma\) at site \(i\),
- \( n_{i\sigma} = c_{i\sigma}^\dagger c_{i\sigma} \) is the number operator.

The Hubbard model captures the competition between electron mobility (hopping) and localization due to repulsive interactions.

### Anderson Model

The Anderson impurity model describes a localized impurity state hybridizing with a sea of conduction electrons, relevant for understanding phenomena like the Kondo effect:

$$
H = \sum_{k,\sigma} \epsilon_k c_{k\sigma}^\dagger c_{k\sigma} + \sum_{\sigma} \epsilon_d d_{\sigma}^\dagger d_{\sigma} + U n_{d\uparrow} n_{d\downarrow} + \sum_{k,\sigma} (V_k c_{k\sigma}^\dagger d_{\sigma} + \text{H.c.})
$$

where:
- \( \epsilon_d \) is the impurity level energy,
- \( V_k \) is the hybridization term,
- \( U \) is the on-site Coulomb interaction for the impurity,
- \( d_{\sigma}^\dagger \) and \( d_{\sigma} \) are the impurity state operators.

### Kondo Lattice Model

The Kondo lattice model extends the Anderson model to a lattice of magnetic impurities interacting with conduction electrons:

$$
H = \sum_{k,\sigma} \epsilon_k c_{k\sigma}^\dagger c_{k\sigma} + J \sum_i \mathbf{S}_i \cdot \mathbf{s}_i
$$

where:
- \( J \) is the Kondo coupling between localized spins \( \mathbf{S}_i \) and conduction electron spins \( \mathbf{s}_i \).

## Computational Methods

### Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT)

DMFT treats local electron correlations exactly while approximating the rest of the system using a mean-field approach. It is particularly powerful for studying systems where local interactions are strong:

- **Self-Consistent Mapping**: Maps the lattice problem to a self-consistent single-site impurity problem.
- **Hybridization Function**: Captures the effect of the rest of the lattice on the impurity site.

### Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC)

QMC methods use stochastic sampling to solve many-body problems. They are versatile and can be used to study finite-temperature properties and dynamic correlations:

- **Auxiliary Field QMC**: Introduces auxiliary fields to decouple interactions, facilitating the evaluation of the partition function.
- **Path Integral QMC**: Uses path integrals to represent quantum states and perform simulations.

### Exact Diagonalization (ED)

ED involves directly diagonalizing the Hamiltonian matrix, providing exact results for small systems:

- **Finite Clusters**: Suitable for studying finite clusters of atoms or molecules.
- **Benchmarks**: Provides benchmarks for testing approximations and other computational methods.

## Key Phenomena

### Metal-Insulator Transition

In strongly correlated materials, the balance between electron localization and itinerancy can lead to a metal-insulator transition (MIT). This transition is driven by electron-electron interactions rather than by band structure alone, as described by the Mott criterion.

### High-Temperature Superconductivity

Cuprate and iron-based superconductors exhibit high-temperature superconductivity. The pairing mechanism in these materials is believed to be mediated by magnetic fluctuations rather than phonons, and understanding this requires dealing with strong correlations.

### Heavy Fermion Behavior

In [[heavy fermion systems]], the effective mass of the quasiparticles is dramatically enhanced due to the hybridization between localized f-electrons and conduction electrons, leading to exotic ground states such as unconventional superconductivity and quantum criticality.

### Quantum Criticality

Near a quantum critical point, fluctuations dominate the behavior of the system, leading to non-Fermi liquid behavior and scaling laws that differ from those in classical phase transitions.
