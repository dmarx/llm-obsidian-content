### Data Leakage

**Data leakage** refers to the unintended exposure of information in a dataset or model that unfairly influences predictions, leading to overly optimistic evaluation metrics. It is a critical issue in machine learning and statistical modeling, as it undermines the generalizability of a model to unseen data. Leakage can occur in various stages of the data pipeline, including data preparation, feature engineering, and model validation.

### Types of Data Leakage

#### 1. **Training-Testing Leakage**
This occurs when information from the test dataset "leaks" into the training process, leading to artificially high performance metrics. This violates the fundamental principle of evaluating models on unseen data.

- **Example**: Splitting the dataset into training and testing subsets *after* applying preprocessing steps such as normalization or scaling.

**Mathematical Formalism**:
Let \( \mathcal{D} \) be the dataset, partitioned as:
$$
\mathcal{D} = \mathcal{D}_{\text{train}} \cup \mathcal{D}_{\text{test}}, \quad \mathcal{D}_{\text{train}} \cap \mathcal{D}_{\text{test}} = \emptyset.
$$
If a transformation \( T \) is applied to \( \mathcal{D} \) (e.g., scaling), and \( T \) uses global statistics (mean, variance, etc.) from \( \mathcal{D} \), the test set \( \mathcal{D}_{\text{test}} \) indirectly influences the training process.

---

#### 2. **Target Leakage**
This occurs when features used in training include data that will not be available at prediction time or are directly derived from the target variable.

- **Example**: Predicting loan defaults using a feature that includes whether the loan was repaid.

**Formalization**:
Let \( \mathbf{X} \) be the feature matrix and \( \mathbf{y} \) be the target variable. If a feature \( X_i \in \mathbf{X} \) is a deterministic function of \( \mathbf{y} \):
$$
X_i = g(\mathbf{y}),
$$
then \( X_i \) introduces leakage since it provides direct information about \( \mathbf{y} \), making predictions trivially correct during training but unusable in real-world scenarios.

---

#### 3. **Feature Leakage**
This involves features that encode future information or violate the chronological order in time-series or event-based datasets.

- **Example**: Predicting stock prices using features derived from future price movements.

**Formalization**:
In a time-series dataset \( \{ (\mathbf{x}_t, y_t) \}_{t=1}^T \), if a feature \( X_i(t) \) depends on \( y_{t+k} \) for \( k > 0 \):
$$
X_i(t) = f(y_{t+k}),
$$
then \( X_i(t) \) leaks future information into the training process, resulting in inflated performance.

### How to Detect Data Leakage

1. **Domain Knowledge**:
   - Evaluate whether a feature could be available at the time of prediction. If not, it is likely causing leakage.
   
2. **Unrealistically High Performance**:
   - Sudden jumps in accuracy, precision, or recall may signal leakage.

3. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Check for unusually high correlations between features and the target variable.

4. **Time-Series Validation**:
   - Use time-based splits to ensure features from future observations do not influence past predictions.

---

### Preventing Data Leakage

1. **Proper Train-Test Splits**:
   - Apply preprocessing steps (e.g., scaling, encoding) *after* splitting the data to avoid contaminating the test set.
   
2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Ensure that features do not include future information or are derived from the target variable.

3. **Pipeline Isolation**:
   - Use tools like [[scikit-learn]]'s `Pipeline` to encapsulate preprocessing steps and prevent leakage during cross-validation.

4. **Time-Aware Modeling**:
   - For time-series data, use techniques like walk-forward validation or block holdout methods.

---

### Example of Data Leakage

Consider a binary classification problem to predict hospital readmission within 30 days based on patient records.

- **Leaky Feature**: `Discharge-to-Home` (indicating discharge location). If this feature depends on whether the patient was readmitted, it introduces target leakage, as it is indirectly correlated with the outcome.
  
- **Solution**: Remove such features or engineer time-limited features that reflect information available *at admission time* only.
