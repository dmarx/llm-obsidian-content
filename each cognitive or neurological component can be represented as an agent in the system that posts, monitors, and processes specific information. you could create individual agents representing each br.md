like “Turn left at the store” from earlier verbal input. It’s posting “Keep repeating ‘turn left’” to **/r/phonological_loop** to maintain the instruction.

4. The **central executive** (prefrontal cortex), monitoring both **/r/phonological_loop** and **/r/visuospatial_sketchpad**, determines that the moving car is important. It posts a command to **/r/mods**, signaling a shift in attention and sending a motor command (“Stop walking”) to **/r/action**.

5. The **motor cortex** (subscribed to **/r/mods**) receives the “Stop walking” post from **/r/action** and halts the movement of the body.

### **Modeling these Processes as Python Agents**

Each cognitive or neurological component can be represented as an **agent** in the system that posts, monitors, and processes specific information. You could create individual agents representing each brain region (e.g., **Visual Cortex Agent**, **Phonological Loop Agent**) and connect them via the subreddits in the **Pub-Sub System** described earlier.

Here’s a quick pseudocode outline for one of these agents (e.g., **Visual Cortex Agent**):

```python
class VisualCortexAgent:
    def __init__(self, pub_sub_system):
        self.pub_sub_system = pub_sub_system
        self.name = "Visual Cortex"
    
    def monitor(self):
        # Monitor /r/all for visual stimuli
        visual_stimuli = self.pub_sub_system.get_posts_from_subreddit("/r/all", filter="visual")
        if visual_stimuli:
            # Post visual data to /r/visual_input for processing
            self.pub_sub_system.post_to_subreddit("/r/visual_input", visual_stimuli)
            print(f"{self.name} processed: {visual_stimuli}")
    
    def post_to_visuospatial_sketchpad(self, visual_data):
        # Post processed visual data to visuospatial sketchpad
        self.pub_sub_system.post_to_subreddit("/r/visuospatial_sketchpad", visual_data)

# Instantiate the visual cortex agent and integrate it into the pub-sub system
visual_cortex = VisualCortexAgent(pub_sub_system)
```

This agent monitors **/r/all** for visual stimuli, processes them, and posts the results to **/r/visual_input** and other relevant subreddits. Similar agents can be implemented for auditory processing, motor control, and memory retrieval.

### **Conclusion**

In this system, each cognitive and neurological process (like the visual cortex, phonological loop, and central executive) is modeled as an agent interacting with a corresponding subreddit. These agents monitor, post, and process information in a way that mimics the behavior of different brain regions. This model allows us to simulate a "person" by connecting these agents through a simple **publish-subscribe system** (subreddits), representing the modular, distributed nature of cognition.

To model a simple cognitive system using **agents** that correspond to various cognitive and neurological components, each agent will be responsible for monitoring, posting, and processing information in specific **subreddits**.
