# Econophysics

[[Econophysics]] is an interdisciplinary research field that applies methodologies, concepts, and models from [[statistical physics]] to understand economic phenomena. Emerging in the mid-1990s, it represents a convergence of [[complex systems theory]], [[statistical mechanics]], and [[financial economics]], offering novel perspectives on economic behaviors and market dynamics.

## Theoretical Foundations

### Statistical Physics Framework

Econophysics applies the mathematical machinery of statistical physics to economic systems:

- **[[Ensemble theory]]**: Economic agents are treated as interacting particles, with macroeconomic properties emerging from microscopic interactions
- **[[Statistical ensembles]]**: Markets are modeled as ensembles of trading agents with various constraints
- **[[Maximum entropy principle]]**: Used to derive least-biased probability distributions under given constraints
- **[[Phase transitions]]**: Economic regime shifts viewed as transitions between different equilibrium states

### Key Physics Concepts Applied to Economics

- **[[Scaling laws]]**: Identifying power-law relationships in economic data
- **[[Self-organized criticality]]**: Markets as systems that naturally evolve toward critical states
- **[[Non-extensive statistical mechanics]]**: Using [[Tsallis entropy]] to model fat-tailed distributions in financial returns
- **[[Multifractal analysis]]**: Characterizing time-varying scaling properties of financial time series

## Mathematical Formalism

### Statistical Analysis of Financial Data

1. **Return Distributions**: For asset price $S(t)$, the logarithmic return over time interval $\Delta t$ is:

   $$r(t, \Delta t) = \ln \frac{S(t+\Delta t)}{S(t)}$$

   Empirically, these returns exhibit:
   - Non-Gaussian distributions with heavy tails
   - Scaling properties across different time intervals
   - Asymmetric negative skewness

2. **[[Inverse cubic law]]**: The probability density function of normalized returns follows:

   $$P(r) \sim |r|^{-\alpha}$$

   where $\alpha \approx 3$ for various markets, time periods, and assets.

### Stochastic Processes

Econophysics has developed specialized stochastic models:

1. **[[Generalized random walks]]**:
   $$S(t+\Delta t) = S(t) \exp[\mu \Delta t + \sigma(t,S) \Delta W(t)]$$
   where $\Delta W(t)$ represents increments of a stochastic process.

2. **[[Heston model]]** with stochastic volatility:
   $$\begin{align}
   dS(t) &= \mu S(t) dt + \sqrt{v(t)} S(t) dW_1(t) \\
   dv(t) &= \kappa(\theta - v(t)) dt + \sigma_v \sqrt{v(t)} dW_2(t)
   \end{align}$$
   where $v(t)$ is the stochastic variance process.

3. **[[Multifractal random walks]]**:
   $$r(t, \Delta t) = \epsilon(t) \cdot \sigma(t) \cdot \Delta t^{H(t)}$$
   where $H(t)$ is a time-varying Hurst exponent.

### Agent-Based Models

[[Agent-based models]] simulate market dynamics from the bottom up:

1. **[[Minority Game]]**: Agents compete to be in the minority group, leading to complex dynamics:
   $$a_i(t+1) = \text{sgn}\left[\sum_{j=1}^m w_{ij}(t) \cdot h_j(t)\right]$$
   where $a_i(t)$ is the action of agent $i$ at time $t$, $w_{ij}(t)$ are adaptive weights, and $h_j(t)$ are input signals.

2. **[[Cont-Bouchaud model]]**: Random clusters of agents make collective buy/sell decisions:
   $$\Delta P(t) = \lambda \cdot \left[\sum_{i=1}^N \phi_i(t) \cdot s_i\right]$$
   where $\phi_i(t)$ is the decision of cluster $i$, $s_i$ is the cluster size, and $\lambda$ is a market impact parameter.

### Network Models

[[Economic networks]] are analyzed using methodologies from [[graph theory]]:

1. **[[Financial networks]]** representation:
   - Nodes: Financial institutions, markets, or agents
   - Edges: Bilateral exposures, trading relationships, or correlations
   - Edge weights $w_{ij}$: Strength of financial connections

2. **[[Systemic risk]]** quantification through network measures:
   - [[DebtRank]]: $R_i = \sum_{j \neq i} v_j (1 - \exp(-\alpha x_{ji}))$
   - [[Contagion centrality]]: $C_i = \sum_{j \neq i} \sum_{\text{paths } p_{ij}} \prod_{(k,l) \in p_{ij}} \beta_{kl}$

## Empirical Findings

### Universal Scaling Laws

1. **[[Pareto wealth distribution]]**: Wealth $w$ follows:
   $$P(w > x) \sim x^{-\alpha}$$
   where $\alpha \approx 1.5-2.5$ across different economies.

2. **[[Firm size distribution]]**:
   $$P(s) \sim s^{-\beta} e^{-s/s_0}$$
   where $s$ is firm size, $\beta \approx 2$, and $s_0$ is a characteristic size.

3. **[[Zipf's law]]** for city sizes:
   $$P(S > s) \sim s^{-1}$$
   where $S$ is the city population.

### Financial Market Anomalies

1. **[[Volatility clustering]]**: Quantified through autocorrelation of absolute returns:
   $$C(|\Delta P_t|, |\Delta P_{t+\tau}|) \sim \tau^{-\gamma}$$
   with $\gamma \approx 0.2-0.4$ across different markets.

2. **[[Leverage effect]]**: Asymmetric correlation between returns and subsequent volatility:
   $$\text{Corr}(r_t, \sigma_{t+\Delta t}^2) < 0$$

3. **[[Trading volume scaling]]**:
   $$\langle V \rangle \sim \langle |r| \rangle^\beta$$
   where $V$ is trading volume and $\beta \approx 1.5-2$.

## Methodological Approaches

### Data Analysis Techniques

1. **[[Detrended fluctuation analysis]]** (DFA):
   - Measures long-range dependence in time series
   - Fluctuation function $F(n) \sim n^H$ where $H$ is the Hurst exponent
   - $H > 0.5$ indicates persistence, $H < 0.5$ indicates anti-persistence

2. **[[Multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis]]** (MFDFA):
   - Extends DFA to capture multifractal properties
   - Generalized Hurst exponent $h(q)$ depends on moment order $q$
   - Multifractal spectrum $f(\alpha)$ characterizes the heterogeneity of scaling

3. **[[Wavelet transform]]**:
   - Decomposes financial time series across different timescales
   - Wavelet coefficients $W_\psi[r](a,t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}} \int r(s) \psi\left(\frac{s-t}{a}\right) ds$
   - Reveals scale-dependent correlations and cross-correlations

### Complex Network Analysis

1. **[[Correlation-based networks]]**:
   - Nodes: Stocks or financial assets
   - Edges: Thresholded correlations $\rho_{ij} > \rho_c$
   - [[Minimum spanning tree]] extraction to identify backbone structure

2. **[[Community detection]]** algorithms:
   - [[Modularity maximization]]: $Q = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{ij} \left[A_{ij} - \frac{k_i k_j}{2m}\right] \delta(c_i, c_j)$
   - Hierarchical clustering of correlation matrices
   - Identification of market sectors and risk clusters

3. **[[Centrality measures]]** for systemic importance:
   - [[Eigenvector centrality]]: $x_i = \frac{1}{\lambda} \sum_{j=1}^N A_{ij} x_j$
   - [[PageRank]]: $PR(i) = \frac{1-d}{N} + d \sum_{j \in M(i)} \frac{PR(j)}{L(j)}$
   - [[Entropy-based centrality]]: $C_i = - \sum_{j} p_{ij} \log p_{ij}$

## Theoretical Models

### Kinetic Wealth Exchange Models

[[Kinetic wealth exchange models]] simulate wealth distributions through pairwise interactions:

$$\begin{align}
w_i' &= w_i - \Delta w\\
w_j' &= w_j + \Delta w
\end{align}$$

where $\Delta w$ represents wealth transferred during a transaction. Different variants include:

1. **[[Dragulescu-Yakovenko model]]**: Fixed saving propensity
2. **[[Chakraborti-Chakrabarti model]]**: Heterogeneous saving propensities
3. **[[Yard-Sale model]]**: Multiplicative wealth exchange process

### Market Crash Models

1. **[[Log-Periodic Power Law Singularity]]** (LPPLS) model:
   $$\ln P(t) \approx A + B(t_c-t)^{\beta} \left[1 + C \cos(\omega \ln(t_c-t) + \phi) \right]$$
   where $t_c$ is the critical time (crash time), $\beta$ is the scaling exponent, and $\omega$ is the log-periodic frequency.

2. **[[Self-Organized Criticality]]** model:
   - Market as a complex system that naturally evolves toward critical states
   - Cascades of failures follow power-law distributions
   - Endogenous crash dynamics without external triggers

### Spin Models of Financial Markets

[[Ising-type models]] represent market participants as interacting spins:

$$H = -J \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} s_i s_j - h \sum_i s_i$$

where:
- $s_i = \pm 1$ represents buy/sell positions
- $J$ quantifies the strength of imitation
- $h$ represents external information

## Formal Mathematical Framework

To provide a unified framework for econophysics, we introduce the following notation:

- $\mathcal{A} = \{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_N\}$: Set of economic agents
- $\mathcal{S}_i$: State space of agent $i$
- $\mathcal{S} = \prod_{i=1}^N \mathcal{S}_i$: Full system state space
- $\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{S})$: Probability measure over system states
- $\mathcal{H}: \mathcal{S} \to \mathbb{R}$: System Hamiltonian
- $\mathcal{T}: \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{S} \to \mathbb{R}^+$: Transition probability function
- $\mathcal{O}: \mathcal{S} \to \mathbb{R}^m$: Observable functions

This formalism enables rigorous development of econophysics models while maintaining connection to both economic theory and statistical physics.
