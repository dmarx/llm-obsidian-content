Preservation of Vision


**ASSISTANT**

**Preservation of vision** refers to maintaining the original intent, meaning, and aesthetic integrity of a creator's work. This concept is crucial for ensuring that a work remains true to its creator's original ideas and message, without unauthorized alterations or misrepresentations that could distort its essence. Preservation of vision is closely tied to moral rights, particularly the [[right of integrity]], and plays a vital role in protecting the personal and artistic interests of creators.

## Key Aspects of Preservation of Vision

### Definition

Preservation of vision involves:
1. Ensuring that a work is presented, performed, or reproduced in a manner that respects the creator's original intent.
2. Protecting the work from unauthorized alterations, distortions, or modifications.
3. Maintaining the aesthetic and conceptual integrity of the work.

### Legal Basis

#### Moral Rights

The concept of preservation of vision is rooted in [[moral rights under copyright law]]. These rights are distinct from economic rights and focus on protecting the personal and reputational interests of creators.

- **Right of Integrity**: This right allows creators to object to any distortion, mutilation, modification, or other derogatory actions in relation to their works that would be prejudicial to their honor or reputation.
- **Right of Paternity**: This right ensures that creators are properly credited for their works, helping to maintain the authenticity and recognition of their vision.

#### Berne Convention

- **Article 6bis**: The Berne Convention explicitly provides for the [[right of integrity]] and the [[right of paternity]], which are essential for the preservation of vision. These rights remain with the creator even after the transfer of economic rights.

### Implications

#### Artistic Control

- **Creative Freedom**: Preservation of vision allows artists and authors to freely express their ideas without fear of unauthorized changes that could distort their message.
- **Authenticity**: Ensures that works are experienced as the creator intended, maintaining their original meaning and impact.

#### Reputation Management

- **Professional Standing**: By protecting their works from unauthorized alterations, creators can safeguard their professional reputation and standing in the creative community.
- **Legacy Protection**: Ensuring that works are preserved in their authentic form helps protect the creator's legacy for future generations.

### Examples

#### Literature

- **Editing and Adaptations**: An author can prevent unauthorized edits or adaptations of their books that alter the narrative or misrepresent the original story.

#### Visual Arts

- **Art Exhibitions**: An artist can object to the display of their artwork in a context that distorts its meaning or misrepresents its intent, such as inappropriate lighting or placement.

#### Music

- **Remixes and Covers**: A composer can prevent unauthorized remixes or covers of their music that change the composition in a way that undermines the original artistic vision.

#### Film and Theatre

- **Directorial Control**: A film director can ensure that their film is not re-edited or modified in a way that distorts the original narrative or artistic expression.

### Case Studies

#### Gilliam v. American Broadcasting Companies, Inc.

- **Background**: Members of Monty Python sued ABC for broadcasting heavily edited versions of their TV shows without authorization.
- **Outcome**: The court recognized the importance of maintaining the [[creative integrity]] of the original work, upholding the creators' right to prevent unauthorized edits that distorted their content.

#### Visual Artists Rights Act (VARA) Cases

- **Carter v. Helmsley-Spear, Inc. (1995)**: Artists successfully asserted their [[right of integrity]] under VARA, preventing the alteration and destruction of their sculptures in a commercial building, thereby maintaining their [[creative integrity]].

## Strategies for Preservation of Vision

### Proactive Measures

- **Contracts and Agreements**: Including specific clauses in contracts that protect the creator's vision, such as approval rights over modifications and adaptations.
- **Creative Control**: Retaining creative control over the work through clear agreements with publishers, producers, and other stakeholders.

### Legal Actions

- **Litigation**: Taking legal action to prevent unauthorized alterations or misrepresentations of the work.
- **Injunctions**: Seeking court orders to stop ongoing or prevent future unauthorized changes to the work.

### Advocacy and Education

- **Raising Awareness**: Educating stakeholders, including publishers, producers, and the public, about the importance of preserving the creator's vision.
- **Advocacy**: Advocating for stronger legal protections and industry practices that respect and uphold the creator's vision.
