**ASSISTANT**

**Economic Dispatch (ED)** refers to the optimization problem of determining the generation levels of a set of power generation units to meet a specific power demand at the lowest cost, while satisfying operational and system constraints. It is a fundamental problem in power systems engineering and operations research, critical for ensuring the efficient and cost-effective operation of electric power grids. 

### Problem Statement

The goal of economic dispatch can be formalized as:

$$
\text{Minimize: } \quad C(P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_N) = \sum_{i=1}^N C_i(P_i)
$$

where:
- $C_i(P_i)$ is the cost function of the $i$-th generator, which is typically a convex function representing fuel costs.
- $P_i$ is the power output of the $i$-th generator.
- $N$ is the total number of generators.

#### Subject to:
1. **Power Balance Constraint**:
   $$
   \sum_{i=1}^N P_i = P_D
   $$
   where $P_D$ is the total power demand.

2. **Generator Limits**:
   $$
   P_i^{\text{min}} \leq P_i \leq P_i^{\text{max}}, \quad \forall i = 1, 2, \ldots, N
   $$
   where $P_i^{\text{min}}$ and $P_i^{\text{max}}$ are the minimum and maximum power output levels of the $i$-th generator.

### Cost Functions
The cost function $C_i(P_i)$ is often represented as a quadratic polynomial:
$$
C_i(P_i) = a_i + b_i P_i + c_i P_i^2
$$
where:
- $a_i$, $b_i$, and $c_i$ are coefficients specific to the generator.

### Solution Methods

Economic dispatch is a constrained optimization problem, commonly solved using:
1. **Lagrange Multipliers**:
   To incorporate the power balance constraint, the Lagrangian function is defined as:
   $$
   \mathcal{L}(P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_N, \lambda) = \sum_{i=1}^N C_i(P_i) + \lambda \left(P_D - \sum_{i=1}^N P_i\right)
   $$
   The necessary conditions for optimality are:
   - $\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial P_i} = \frac{dC_i}{dP_i} - \lambda = 0 \quad \forall i$
   - $\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \lambda} = P_D - \sum_{i=1}^N P_i = 0$

   Solving these equations yields:
   $$
   \frac{dC_i}{dP_i} = \lambda \quad \forall i
   $$
   The economic dispatch principle ensures that the marginal cost of generation is equal across all generators.

2. **Linear Programming**:
   If cost functions are linear, economic dispatch can be formulated as a linear program.

3. **Iterative Methods**:
   - The **Lambda Iteration Method** is widely used for quadratic cost functions.
   - **Dynamic Programming** can handle non-linear cost functions or systems with discrete constraints.

4. **Modern Techniques**:
   - [[Genetic Algorithms|Genetic algorithms]] and [[Particle Swarm Optimization|particle swarm optimization]] are applied to handle non-convex cost functions or other complexities like prohibited operating zones.

### Extensions of Economic Dispatch
1. **Security-Constrained Economic Dispatch (SCED)**:
   Incorporates network security constraints such as transmission limits.

2. **Emission-Constrained Economic Dispatch**:
   Minimizes costs while also accounting for emissions limits or trading costs of pollutants.

3. **Unit Commitment (UC)**:
   Economic dispatch is typically embedded within the larger [[unit commitment]] problem, which determines the on/off status of generators in addition to power levels.

4. **Dynamic Economic Dispatch**:
   Considers time-varying demand and generation costs over a planning horizon.

### Practical Considerations
- **Ramp Rate Limits**: Some generators cannot change output instantaneously, requiring ramp rate constraints.
- **Prohibited Operating Zones**: Certain ranges of $P_i$ may be disallowed due to stability or mechanical issues.
- **Renewables Integration**: Stochastic renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, introduce uncertainty, leading to [[stochastic programming]] approaches to economic dispatch.
