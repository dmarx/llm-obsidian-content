Budapest Open Access Initiative


**ASSISTANT**

The [[Budapest Open Access Initiative]] (BOAI) is a significant milestone in the history of the [[open access movement]]. It was conceived at a meeting convened in Budapest by the Open Society Institute (OSI) on December 1-2, 2001, and the resulting declaration was published on February 14, 2002. The BOAI provided one of the earliest and most influential definitions and strategies for achieving open access to peer-reviewed scholarly literature.

### Key Aspects of the BOAI

#### Definition of Open Access
The BOAI defined open access as the free availability of scholarly research on the public internet, permitting any user to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of these articles, crawl them for indexing, pass them as data to software, or use them for any other lawful purpose, without financial, legal, or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to the internet itself.

#### Strategies for Achieving Open Access
The BOAI proposed two primary strategies for achieving open access:

1. **Self-Archiving**:
   - Authors are encouraged to deposit copies of their peer-reviewed articles in open electronic archives, known as repositories.
   - These repositories could be institutional (hosted by universities or research institutions) or discipline-specific.
   - The act of self-archiving does not interfere with the traditional peer review process but ensures that the article is freely accessible.

2. **Open Access Journals**:
   - Encourage the creation and support of open access journals that provide free access to their contents immediately upon publication.
   - These journals must maintain high standards of quality control and peer review.
   - Open access journals might employ various funding models, such as sponsorships, subsidies, or article processing charges (APCs).

### Impact of the BOAI

#### Influence on Policies and Practices
The BOAI has had a profound impact on shaping open access policies and practices worldwide. Many funding agencies, research institutions, and governments have adopted policies that align with the principles outlined in the BOAI, requiring or encouraging open access to publicly funded research.

#### Growth of Open Access Repositories
Following the BOAI, the number of open access repositories grew significantly, making it easier for researchers to self-archive their work. Examples of widely used repositories include [[arXiv]], [[PubMed Central]], and institutional repositories at universities.

#### Proliferation of Open Access Journals
The BOAI inspired the launch of numerous open access journals across various disciplines. Prominent examples include PLOS ONE, BMC (BioMed Central) series, and the Frontiers journals. The [[Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ)]] was established to index and provide access to high-quality open access, peer-reviewed journals.

### Continuing Challenges
Despite the progress made since the BOAI, several challenges remain:

- **Sustainability**: Developing sustainable funding models for open access journals, especially those that do not charge APCs.
- **Equity**: Ensuring that researchers from less wealthy institutions or countries can participate in open access publishing without financial barriers.
- **Quality Control**: Maintaining rigorous peer review and avoiding the proliferation of predatory journals that exploit the open access model.
