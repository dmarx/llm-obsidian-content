# Moral Entrepreneurs

The concept of moral entrepreneurs was introduced by sociologist Howard S. Becker in his seminal work "Outsiders: Studies in the Sociology of Deviance" (1963). Moral entrepreneurs are individuals or groups who take the initiative to create and enforce new rules and norms within society. They play a critical role in the social construction of deviance and morality by campaigning to change public perceptions and institutional policies.
