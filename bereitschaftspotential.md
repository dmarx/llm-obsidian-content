### Bereitschaftspotential

**Definition:** Bereitschaftspotential (BP), also known as the readiness potential, is a measure of brain activity that occurs before voluntary muscle movements. It is a slow negative shift in electrical potential that can be detected using electroencephalography (EEG). The BP is typically observed over the motor cortex and begins several hundred milliseconds before the onset of a voluntary movement.

### Discovery and Historical Context

The Bereitschaftspotential was first described by German neurologists Hans Helmut Kornhuber and LÃ¼der Deecke in the 1960s. Their groundbreaking work demonstrated that preparatory brain activity precedes voluntary movement, providing insight into the neural processes underlying motor planning and initiation.

### Characteristics and Phases

#### Early BP (BP1)

- **Timeframe:** Starts approximately 1-2 seconds before movement onset.
- **Location:** Primarily originates from the supplementary motor area (SMA) and pre-SMA.
- **Function:** Associated with the initial stages of motor planning and preparation.

#### Late BP (BP2)

- **Timeframe:** Begins approximately 400-500 milliseconds before movement onset.
- **Location:** Involves primary motor cortex (M1) and premotor cortex.
- **Function:** Linked to the final stages of motor preparation and the execution of movement.

### Measurement and Detection

#### Electroencephalography (EEG)

The Bereitschaftspotential is measured using EEG, which records electrical activity from the scalp. The BP is identified as a gradual buildup of negative electrical potential over the motor cortex, detected through electrodes placed on the scalp.

- **Setup:** EEG electrodes are placed according to the international 10-20 system, with a focus on areas overlying the motor cortex.
- **Analysis:** The EEG signal is averaged over multiple trials to enhance the BP signal, which is typically weak and requires averaging to be clearly discernible.

### Theoretical Implications

#### Motor Planning and Execution

The Bereitschaftspotential provides evidence for the brain's role in planning and initiating voluntary movements. It suggests that the decision to move is preceded by a period of neural preparation, challenging the notion of instantaneous movement initiation.

#### Free Will and Consciousness

The discovery of the BP has significant implications for discussions about free will and conscious decision-making. Studies, such as those conducted by Benjamin Libet, have shown that the BP occurs before individuals report a conscious intention to move. This raises questions about the relationship between unconscious neural processes and conscious volition.

- **Libet's Experiments:** Libet found that the BP begins several hundred milliseconds before participants report the conscious intention to move, suggesting that unconscious brain processes initiate movement before conscious awareness.

### Applications

#### Clinical Neurophysiology

The Bereitschaftspotential has applications in clinical neurophysiology for understanding and diagnosing motor disorders. It is used to study conditions such as Parkinson's disease, where abnormalities in motor preparation and execution are evident.

- **Parkinson's Disease:** Patients with Parkinson's disease often exhibit altered BP, reflecting disruptions in the motor planning processes.

#### Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs)

BCIs leverage the BP for controlling external devices. By detecting the BP, BCIs can predict movement intentions and translate them into actions, aiding individuals with motor impairments.

- **BCI Development:** Detecting BP allows for the development of BCIs that can assist in communication and movement for patients with severe motor disabilities.

### Criticisms and Challenges

#### Interpretation of BP

One challenge in BP research is the interpretation of its significance. While the BP is clearly associated with motor preparation, its exact role and the extent to which it reflects conscious intention versus automatic processes remain debated.

#### Methodological Issues

Accurately measuring the BP requires sophisticated EEG setups and extensive data averaging, making it a complex and resource-intensive process. Variability in experimental conditions can also affect the reliability of BP detection.

### Summary

Bereitschaftspotential (BP) is a measure of brain activity that precedes voluntary muscle movements, indicating the brain's preparatory processes. Discovered by Kornhuber and Deecke, the BP has profound implications for understanding motor planning, consciousness, and free will. It has practical applications in clinical neurophysiology and brain-computer interfaces, although challenges remain in its interpretation and measurement. The study of BP continues to provide valuable insights into the neural mechanisms underlying voluntary movement.
