**USER**

alt.humor


**ASSISTANT**

**`alt.humor`** is a Usenet newsgroup within the **`alt.*` hierarchy** that focuses on humor, jokes, and lighthearted content. It is part of the larger **`alt.*` hierarchy**, which was known for its flexibility, as new newsgroups could be created without requiring formal approval from the Usenet community. This made the `alt.*` groups a hub for more informal, diverse, and sometimes offbeat or niche discussions, including humor.

### Purpose and Content of `alt.humor`

The **`alt.humor`** newsgroup was primarily a space for users to share jokes, humorous stories, and satirical content. It was often populated with short jokes, one-liners, puns, funny anecdotes, and humorous commentary on current events. The freeform nature of the group allowed for a wide range of comedic styles, from lighthearted jokes to more absurd or edgy humor. 

Since Usenet is a text-based medium, much of the humor in `alt.humor` relied heavily on the written word, playing on linguistic nuances, wordplay, and textual timing.

### Subgroups and Related Newsgroups

Due to the popularity of humor-related content, **`alt.humor`** spawned a variety of related newsgroups that catered to more specific types of humor:
- **`alt.humor.best-of-[[usenet]]`**: A group for sharing the "best" humorous posts from other parts of Usenet.
- **`alt.humor.puns`**: Focused specifically on puns and wordplay.
- **`alt.humor.jewish`**: Centered around Jewish humor, exploring cultural and religious jokes.
- **`alt.humor.jokes`**: A more general group for sharing all types of jokes, often less satirical and more structured like traditional joke-telling.

### Cultural Impact and Memes

Usenet, and especially groups like **`alt.humor`**, played a crucial role in the early dissemination of **internet memes** and jokes. Some well-known internet phenomena either originated in or were popularized by `alt.humor` and its subgroups. For example:
- **"The Dancing Baby"** meme (one of the first viral internet memes) was shared on Usenet in the 1990s.
- **Godwin's Law** (the observation that as an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches 1) was formulated in the context of Usenet discussions and later became a running joke in humor groups like `alt.humor`.

### User-Generated Humor and DIY Culture

The humor in **`alt.humor`** was almost entirely user-generated. Unlike modern humor websites or social media platforms that often aggregate content from various sources, Usenet humor groups were about contributing original content. This fostered a **DIY culture** where people crafted their own jokes, played off others’ posts, and developed in-jokes specific to the Usenet community.

### Legacy and Decline

As with much of Usenet, the activity in **`alt.humor`** and its related groups has significantly declined since the late 1990s and early 2000s due to the rise of web-based forums, social media, and dedicated humor websites (e.g., **Reddit**, **9gag**, **Twitter**). However, the early discussions in groups like `alt.humor` laid the groundwork for the humor cultures that would later flourish on platforms like Reddit's **r/funny** or 4chan’s **/b/** board.

Despite the decline in mainstream use, some Usenet humor groups continue to exist and are accessed by niche communities, particularly for nostalgic or archival purposes. The **early internet culture** that flourished in `alt.humor` remains an important part of the history of online humor and meme culture.
