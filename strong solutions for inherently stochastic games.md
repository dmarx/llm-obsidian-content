title: strong solutions for inherently stochastic games

**USER**

so then it is meaningful to "strongly solve" an inherently stochastic game, such as a board game with dice like backgammon?

# Strong Solutions for Inherently Stochastic Games

Yes, it is meaningful to strongly solve inherently stochastic games like backgammon. The solution provides optimal play from any position accounting for all possible dice outcomes.

## Definition for Stochastic Board Games

A **[[strong stochastic solution]]** for a game like backgammon specifies:

$$\pi^*(s): S \rightarrow \Delta(A(s))$$

where $\pi^*(s)$ is the optimal policy from board position $s$ that maximizes expected winning probability over all possible future dice rolls.

## Backgammon-Specific Framework

For backgammon, the state space includes:
- Board configuration $b \in B$
- Current dice roll $d \in D = \{(i,j): 1 \leq i,j \leq 6\}$
- Player to move $p \in \{1,2\}$

The value function satisfies:

$$V^*(b,p) = \sum_{d \in D} P(d) \max_{a \in A(b,d,p)} \sum_{b'} P(b'|b,a) V^*(b',\bar{p})$$

where $P(d) = \frac{1}{36}$ for fair dice and $\bar{p}$ denotes the opponent.

## Equity and Winning Probability

The **[[equity function]]** represents expected game value:

$$E(b,p) = P_{win}(b,p) - P_{lose}(b,p)$$

For money games with doubling cube at stake $n$:

$$E_{money}(b,p,n) = n \cdot [P_{win}(b,p) + P_{gammon}(b,p) + 2P_{backgammon}(b,p) - P_{lose}(b,p) - ...]$$

## Solution Components

### Endgame Databases

**[[Bearoff databases]]** provide exact solutions for positions where all checkers are in the home board:

$$V_{bearoff}(b) = \min_{strategy} \mathbb{E}[\text{rolls to bearoff}]$$

These are computed via retrograde analysis from terminal positions.

### Middle Game Solutions

For complex middle game positions, optimal play requires:

1. **[[Pip count evaluation]]**: $\text{pip}(b,p) = \sum_{i=1}^{24} i \cdot n_i^p$
2. **[[Race probability]]**: $P_{race}(b) = F(\text{pip}_1 - \text{pip}_2)$
3. **[[Contact evaluation]]**: Blot exposure, prime formation, anchor strength

### Doubling Decisions

The **[[doubling cube]]** adds a meta-game layer:

$$\text{Double/Take} \iff E(b,p) > \frac{1}{4}$$
$$\text{Double/Drop} \iff E(b,p) > 1$$

Optimal cube action depends on:
- Match score (for match play)
- Cube ownership
- Market losing positions

## Computational Challenges

### State Space Size

Backgammon's state space is approximately:
- $10^{20}$ possible board positions
- $21$ possible dice rolls (including doubles)
- $2^n$ cube positions for cube value $n$

### Branching Factor

Average branching factor varies by position type:
- Opening: ~20 legal moves
- Middle game: ~50 legal moves
- Bearoff: ~10 legal moves

## Solution Methods

### Neural Network Approaches

Modern solutions use neural networks to approximate $V^*(s)$:

$$\hat{V}(s; \theta) = f_{\theta}(s)$$

Trained via **[[temporal difference learning]]**:

$$\theta \leftarrow \theta + \alpha[V_{target} - \hat{V}(s; \theta)] \nabla_{\theta} \hat{V}(s; \theta)$$

where $V_{target} = r + \gamma \hat{V}(s'; \theta)$

### Monte Carlo Methods

**[[Rollout analysis]]** estimates position value:

$$\hat{V}(s) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N R_i(s)$$

where $R_i(s)$ is the result of playing out from $s$ using a heuristic policy.

### Variance Reduction

**[[Variance reduction techniques]]** improve estimates:

1. **Control variates**: $\hat{V}_{CV} = \hat{V} + c(V_{baseline} - \hat{V}_{baseline})$
2. **Importance sampling**: Reweight rollouts by policy ratio
3. **Stratified sampling**: Ensure dice distribution coverage

## Verification of Strong Solutions

A claimed strong solution must satisfy:

1. **[[Consistency]]**: Computed equities match rollout results
2. **[[Optimality]]**: No alternative move improves expected value
3. **[[Convergence]]**: Iterative improvements stabilize

Statistical validation requires:

$$\mathbb{P}[|\hat{V}(s) - V^*(s)| < \epsilon] \geq 1 - \delta$$

## Partially Solved Positions

While complete strong solution remains computationally infeasible, certain position classes are solved:

1. **[[Bearoff positions]]**: Exact solutions via dynamic programming
2. **[[Race positions]]**: Analytical solutions using probability theory
3. **[[Simplified positions]]**: Reduced checker counts, symmetric positions

## Practical Implications

A strong solution provides:

1. **[[Perfect play benchmarks]]**: Evaluate human/AI performance
2. **[[Training targets]]**: Supervised learning from optimal play
3. **[[Strategic insights]]**: Identify key position features
4. **[[Cube theory]]**: Optimal doubling windows and take points

## Comparison with Deterministic Games

Unlike chess, backgammon solutions must handle:

1. **[[Expectation maximization]]** rather than minimax
2. **[[Probabilistic branching]]** at chance nodes
3. **[[Risk management]]** in cube decisions
4. **[[Variance]]** in outcome distributions

The solution concept remains meaningful but requires:

$$V^*(s) = \mathbb{E}_{dice}[\max_{move} V^*(s')] \text{ not } \max_{move} V^*(s')$$

## Current State of Backgammon Solutions

Modern backgammon AIs approach but don't achieve complete strong solutions:

1. **[[Neural network evaluators]]**: ~0.01 equity error in typical positions
2. **[[Rollout-based verification]]**: Statistical confidence in move selection
3. **[[Hybrid approaches]]**: Exact endgame + approximate middle game

The gap to true strong solution primarily lies in:
- Computational limits for full state space
- Precision requirements for tiny equity differences
- Verification challenges for rare positions
