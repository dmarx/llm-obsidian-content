# Perturbative Expansion

Perturbative expansion is a powerful mathematical technique in [[theoretical physics]] and [[applied mathematics]] used to approximate solutions to complex problems by expressing them as series expansions in terms of a small parameter. This approach is fundamental to many areas of physics, particularly [[quantum field theory]], [[statistical mechanics]], and [[many-body theory]], where exact solutions are often mathematically intractable.

## Mathematical Foundation

### Basic Formalism

A perturbative expansion represents the solution to a problem as a power series in a small parameter $\lambda$:

$$f(x, \lambda) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \lambda^n f_n(x)$$

Where:
- $f(x, \lambda)$ is the quantity being approximated
- $\lambda$ is the perturbation parameter (typically $\lambda \ll 1$)
- $f_n(x)$ are the perturbative corrections of order $n$

The zeroth-order term $f_0(x)$ represents the unperturbed solution, while higher-order terms account for successive corrections.

### Perturbation of Differential Equations

For a differential equation of the form:

$$\mathcal{L}f(x, \lambda) + \lambda \mathcal{V}f(x, \lambda) = 0$$

Where $\mathcal{L}$ is an operator with known solutions and $\mathcal{V}$ is a perturbing operator, the perturbative expansion leads to a hierarchy of equations:

$$\mathcal{L}f_0(x) = 0$$
$$\mathcal{L}f_1(x) + \mathcal{V}f_0(x) = 0$$
$$\mathcal{L}f_2(x) + \mathcal{V}f_1(x) = 0$$

Each equation determines the next order correction using the solutions from lower orders.

## Quantum Mechanical Applications

### Time-Independent Perturbation Theory

In [[quantum mechanics]], for a Hamiltonian $H = H_0 + \lambda V$ where $H_0$ has known eigenstates $|n^{(0)}\rangle$ and eigenvalues $E_n^{(0)}$, the perturbed energy levels are:

$$E_n = E_n^{(0)} + \lambda E_n^{(1)} + \lambda^2 E_n^{(2)} + \ldots$$

Where:
- $E_n^{(1)} = \langle n^{(0)} | V | n^{(0)} \rangle$ (first-order correction)
- $E_n^{(2)} = \sum_{m \neq n} \frac{|\langle m^{(0)} | V | n^{(0)} \rangle|^2}{E_n^{(0)} - E_m^{(0)}}$ (second-order correction)

Similarly, the eigenstates can be expanded as:

$$|n\rangle = |n^{(0)}\rangle + \lambda |n^{(1)}\rangle + \lambda^2 |n^{(2)}\rangle + \ldots$$

Where:
- $|n^{(1)}\rangle = \sum_{m \neq n} \frac{\langle m^{(0)} | V | n^{(0)} \rangle}{E_n^{(0)} - E_m^{(0)}} |m^{(0)}\rangle$

### Time-Dependent Perturbation Theory

For time-dependent Hamiltonians $H(t) = H_0 + \lambda V(t)$, the transition amplitude between states is:

$$c_i^{(1)}(t) = -i \int_0^t dt' e^{i\omega_{if}t'} \langle f | V(t') | i \rangle$$

Where $\omega_{if} = (E_f - E_i)/\hbar$ is the transition frequency.

This leads to results like [[Fermi's golden rule]]:

$$\Gamma_{i \rightarrow f} = \frac{2\pi}{\hbar} |\langle f | V | i \rangle|^2 \rho(E_f)$$

Where $\rho(E_f)$ is the density of final states.

## Field Theory Methods

### Feynman Diagrams

In [[quantum field theory]], perturbative expansions are often represented graphically using [[Feynman diagrams]], where:

1. Each diagram corresponds to a specific term in the perturbative series
2. Lines represent propagation of particles
3. Vertices represent interactions, each contributing a factor of the coupling constant $\lambda$
4. The mathematical value of a diagram is computed using [[Feynman rules]]

The scattering amplitude is then:

$$\mathcal{M} = \mathcal{M}^{(0)} + \lambda \mathcal{M}^{(1)} + \lambda^2 \mathcal{M}^{(2)} + \ldots$$

Where each $\mathcal{M}^{(n)}$ represents the sum of all diagrams with $n$ vertices.

### Path Integral Formulation

In the [[path integral formulation]], the generating functional is expanded as:

$$Z[J] = Z_0[J] \exp\left(i \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-i\lambda)^n}{n!} \int d^4x_1 \ldots d^4x_n \frac{\delta^n S_{\text{int}}[\phi]}{\delta\phi(x_1) \ldots \delta\phi(x_n)} \frac{\delta^n}{\delta J(x_1) \ldots \delta J(x_n)}\right) Z_0[J]$$

Where $Z_0[J]$ is the generating functional for the free theory and $S_{\text{int}}[\phi]$ is the interaction part of the action.

## Methods in Statistical Physics

### High-Temperature Expansion

In [[statistical mechanics]], the [[high-temperature expansion]] expresses thermodynamic quantities as series in the inverse temperature $\beta = 1/k_B T$:

$$Z = \text{Tr}(e^{-\beta H}) = \text{Tr}(e^{-\beta H_0} e^{-\beta V}) \approx \text{Tr}\left(e^{-\beta H_0}\left(1 - \beta V + \frac{\beta^2 V^2}{2} - \ldots\right)\right)$$

This is useful for systems where thermal fluctuations dominate over interaction effects.

### Low-Temperature Expansion

Conversely, the [[low-temperature expansion]] focuses on the ground state and low-lying excitations:

$$F = E_0 + k_B T \sum_n \ln(1 - e^{-\beta E_n})$$

Where $E_0$ is the ground state energy and $E_n$ are excitation energies.

### Virial Expansion

The [[virial expansion]] expresses the equation of state as a series in powers of density:

$$\frac{PV}{Nk_B T} = 1 + B_2(T) \rho + B_3(T) \rho^2 + \ldots$$

Where $B_n(T)$ are the [[virial coefficients]] and $\rho = N/V$ is the number density.

## Convergence Issues

### Asymptotic Series

Many perturbative expansions in physics are [[asymptotic series]] rather than convergent series, meaning:

1. They do not converge for any non-zero value of the expansion parameter
2. However, truncating at an optimal order gives a good approximation
3. The error in truncating at order $n$ is typically proportional to $\lambda^{n+1}$

For an asymptotic series, there exists an optimal truncation point $n_{\text{opt}} \approx 1/\lambda$ beyond which adding more terms worsens the approximation.

### Regularization and Renormalization

In [[quantum field theory]], perturbative expansions often encounter [[divergences]] that require [[regularization]] and [[renormalization]]:

1. **Regularization**: Introducing a cutoff or dimensional parameter to make integrals finite
2. **Renormalization**: Absorbing infinities into redefinitions of physical parameters

This procedure leads to the [[renormalization group]] equations:

$$\mu \frac{d \lambda}{d\mu} = \beta(\lambda)$$

Where $\mu$ is the renormalization scale and $\beta(\lambda)$ is the [[beta function]].

## Resummation Techniques

### Padé Approximants

[[Padé approximants]] replace the truncated power series with rational functions:

$$[m/n]_f(x) = \frac{P_m(x)}{Q_n(x)} = \frac{a_0 + a_1 x + \ldots + a_m x^m}{1 + b_1 x + \ldots + b_n x^n}$$

The coefficients are determined by matching the power series expansion of the rational function to the original series up to order $m+n$.

### Borel Resummation

[[Borel resummation]] improves convergence by:

1. Forming the Borel transform: $\tilde{f}(t) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f_n}{n!} t^n$
2. Analytically continuing $\tilde{f}(t)$ if possible
3. Computing the Laplace transform: $f(x) = \int_0^{\infty} e^{-t} \tilde{f}(xt) dt$

This technique can sometimes give meaning to divergent series.

### Dyson Series

In [[quantum mechanics]], the [[Dyson series]] expresses the time-evolution operator as:

$$U(t, t_0) = \mathcal{T} \exp\left(-\frac{i}{\hbar} \int_{t_0}^{t} H(t') dt'\right) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} U_n(t, t_0)$$

Where $\mathcal{T}$ is the time-ordering operator and:

$$U_n(t, t_0) = \left(-\frac{i}{\hbar}\right)^n \int_{t_0}^{t} dt_1 \int_{t_0}^{t_1} dt_2 \ldots \int_{t_0}^{t_{n-1}} dt_n H(t_1) H(t_2) \ldots H(t_n)$$

## Advanced Methods

### Linked Cluster Expansion

The [[linked cluster theorem]] states that the logarithm of the partition function can be written as a sum of connected diagrams:

$$\ln Z = \sum_{\text{connected diagrams}} \frac{1}{S} D$$

Where $S$ is the symmetry factor of the diagram. This simplifies the calculation of thermodynamic quantities.

### Large-N Expansion

The [[large-N expansion]] organizes the perturbative series in powers of $1/N$, where $N$ is a parameter like the number of field components:

$$f(g, N) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{f_k(g)}{N^k}$$

This approach is particularly useful for systems with internal symmetries.

### Method of Steepest Descent

The [[method of steepest descent]] (or [[saddle-point approximation]]) approximates integrals of the form:

$$I(\lambda) = \int_a^b f(x) e^{\lambda g(x)} dx$$

For large $\lambda$ by expanding around the maximum of $g(x)$, leading to a perturbative expansion in powers of $1/\lambda$.

## Applications in Modern Physics

### Effective Field Theories

[[Effective field theories]] use perturbative expansions in a systematic way to describe physics at a given energy scale:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{eff}} = \mathcal{L}_0 + \sum_i \frac{c_i}{\Lambda^{d_i-4}} \mathcal{O}_i$$

Where:
- $\mathcal{L}_0$ is the renormalizable part of the Lagrangian
- $\mathcal{O}_i$ are higher-dimensional operators
- $c_i$ are Wilson coefficients
- $\Lambda$ is the cutoff scale
- $d_i$ is the mass dimension of the operator $\mathcal{O}_i$

### AdS/CFT Correspondence

In the [[AdS/CFT correspondence]], perturbative expansions in the coupling constant of the gauge theory correspond to expansions in the curvature of the gravitational theory:

$$\frac{1}{g_{\text{YM}}^2 N} \leftrightarrow \frac{\alpha'}{R^2}$$

Where $g_{\text{YM}}$ is the Yang-Mills coupling, $N$ is the number of colors, $\alpha'$ is the string tension, and $R$ is the AdS radius.

1. [[Richardson extrapolation]]: Combining approximations at different orders

### Symbolic Computation

[[Computer algebra systems]] enable:

1. Automated generation of high-order terms
2. Manipulation of symbolic expressions
3. Application of resummation techniques

2. [[Pseudo-arclength continuation]]: Parameterize by curve length
3. [[Bifurcation analysis]]: Identify qualitative changes in behavior
