**USER**

probability [[generating function]]


**ASSISTANT**

The probability [[generating function]] (PGF) is a powerful tool in probability theory, particularly useful for studying discrete random variables, especially those taking non-negative integer values. The PGF encapsulates the probabilities of a random variable into a single function, facilitating various types of analysis and manipulation, such as finding moments and solving problems involving sums of independent random variables.

## Definition

For a discrete random variable \( X \) that takes non-negative integer values, the probability [[generating function]] \( G_X(s) \) is defined as:

$$
G_X(s) = \mathbb{E}[s^X] = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} P(X = k) s^k,
$$

where \( P(X = k) \) is the probability that \( X \) takes the value \( k \), and \( s \) is a real or complex variable.

## Properties

### Evaluation at Specific Points

- \( G_X(1) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} P(X = k) = 1 \) because it sums all probabilities, which equals 1.
- \( G_X(0) = P(X = 0) \) because it picks out the probability of \( X \) being zero.

### Moments

The moments of \( X \) can be derived from the PGF. The \( n \)-th moment about the origin can be found using the \( n \)-th derivative of \( G_X(s) \) evaluated at \( s = 1 \):

$$
\mathbb{E}[X] = G_X'(1),
$$

$$
\mathbb{E}[X(X-1)] = G_X''(1),
$$

and in general,

$$
\mathbb{E}[X^n] = \left. \left( s \frac{d}{ds} \right)^n G_X(s) \right|_{s=1}.
$$

### Sum of Independent Random Variables

If \( X \) and \( Y \) are independent discrete random variables with PGFs \( G_X(s) \) and \( G_Y(s) \), respectively, then the PGF of their sum \( Z = X + Y \) is the product of their PGFs:

$$
G_Z(s) = G_X(s) G_Y(s).
$$

### Convolution Property

For two independent random variables \( X \) and \( Y \), the probability that their sum \( X + Y = k \) can be derived from the product of their PGFs. This property is particularly useful in branching processes and queuing theory.

## Examples

### Bernoulli Distribution

For a Bernoulli random variable \( X \) with parameter \( p \) (i.e., \( P(X = 1) = p \) and \( P(X = 0) = 1 - p \)), the PGF is:

$$
G_X(s) = (1-p) + ps.
$$

### Binomial Distribution

For a binomial random variable \( X \) with parameters \( n \) (number of trials) and \( p \) (success probability), the PGF is:

$$
G_X(s) = \left( (1-p) + ps \right)^n.
$$

### Poisson Distribution

For a Poisson random variable \( X \) with parameter \( \lambda \) (rate), the PGF is:

$$
G_X(s) = e^{\lambda(s-1)}.
$$

### Geometric Distribution

For a geometric random variable \( X \) with parameter \( p \) (success probability), the PGF is:

$$
G_X(s) = \frac{ps}{1 - (1-p)s}, \quad |s| < \frac{1}{1-p}.
$$

## Applications

### Deriving Moments

To find the mean and variance of a random variable \( X \) using its PGF, \( G_X(s) \):

1. **Mean**:
   $$ \mathbb{E}[X] = G_X'(1). $$

2. **Variance**:
   $$ \text{Var}(X) = G_X''(1) + G_X'(1) - (G_X'(1))^2. $$

### Compound Distributions

In risk theory and actuarial science, the PGF is used to study compound distributions. If \( N \) is the number of claims with PGF \( G_N(s) \) and \( X_i \) are the claim sizes with common PGF \( G_X(s) \), then the total claim size \( S = \sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i \) has a PGF given by:

$$
G_S(s) = G_N(G_X(s)).
```

### Branching Processes

In branching processes, the PGF helps describe the distribution of the total number of offspring in subsequent generations. The Galton-Watson process is a classic example where the PGF plays a crucial role in understanding extinction probabilities and expected population sizes over generations.
