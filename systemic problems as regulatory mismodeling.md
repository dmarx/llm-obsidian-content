title: systemic problems as regulatory mismodeling
---

**USER**

I meant more in the sense that "Every Good Regulator of a System Must Be a Model of That System". So if you have a bad model of a system (the system was parameterized incorrectly in your model), your attempts to regulate regulate that system will necessarily be in tension with the desirable states you are trying to drive the system towards (=def systemic problems)

# Systemic Problems as Regulatory Mismodeling

"Systemic problems" emerge when a regulator operates with an inaccurate [[model]] of the system it attempts to regulate, directly following from the [[Good Regulator Theorem]]: "Every Good Regulator of a System Must Be a Model of That System" (Conant & Ashby, 1970). When the system is parameterized incorrectly in the regulator's model, any regulatory actions will necessarily create tensions with the desirable states toward which the regulator is attempting to drive the system.

## Mathematical Formalization

Let $S$ be the actual system with dynamics:

$$\frac{d\mathbf{x}}{dt} = f_S(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{u}, \boldsymbol{\theta}_S)$$

Where:
- $\mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{X}$ is the system state
- $\mathbf{u} \in \mathcal{U}$ is the control input
- $\boldsymbol{\theta}_S$ represents the true system parameters

Let $M$ be the regulator's model of $S$ with dynamics:

$$\frac{d\mathbf{\hat{x}}}{dt} = f_M(\mathbf{\hat{x}}, \mathbf{u}, \boldsymbol{\theta}_M)$$

Where $\boldsymbol{\theta}_M$ represents the parameters in the regulator's model.

A systemic problem arises when:

$$\boldsymbol{\theta}_M \neq \boldsymbol{\theta}_S$$

This parameterization mismatch leads to a [[model error]] $\varepsilon$:

$$\varepsilon(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{u}) = \|f_S(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{u}, \boldsymbol{\theta}_S) - f_M(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{u}, \boldsymbol{\theta}_M)\|$$

## Regulatory Tension

The regulator attempts to drive the system toward a desirable state $\mathbf{x}_d$ by computing control inputs:

$$\mathbf{u}^* = \arg\min_{\mathbf{u} \in \mathcal{U}} \|\mathbf{\hat{x}}(T) - \mathbf{x}_d\|^2$$

Where $\mathbf{\hat{x}}(T)$ is the predicted state at time $T$ according to the model $M$.

However, when applied to the actual system $S$, these inputs produce a trajectory that deviates from the predicted one, creating a [[regulatory tension]]:

$$\mathcal{T} = \|\mathbf{x}(T) - \mathbf{\hat{x}}(T)\|$$

This tension manifests as [[systemic problems]] - persistent deviations from desired outcomes despite ongoing regulatory efforts.

## Varieties of Parametric Mismodeling

### 1. Structural Mismatch

The regulator's model has a fundamentally different structure than the actual system:

$$f_M \in \mathcal{F}_M, f_S \in \mathcal{F}_S, \text{ where } \mathcal{F}_M \cap \mathcal{F}_S = \emptyset$$

This creates irreconcilable tensions regardless of parameter tuning.

### 2. Dimensional Reduction

The regulator's model operates in a lower-dimensional space than the actual system:

$$\dim(\boldsymbol{\theta}_M) < \dim(\boldsymbol{\theta}_S)$$

Important dynamics are ignored or abstracted away, leading to unexpected behaviors.

### 3. Parameter Misestimation

The regulator's model has the correct structure but incorrect parameter values:

$$f_M = f_S \text{ but } \boldsymbol{\theta}_M \neq \boldsymbol{\theta}_S$$

This creates quantitative prediction errors that accumulate over time.

### 4. Feedback Misspecification

The regulator misunderstands how interventions affect the system:

$$\frac{\partial f_M}{\partial \mathbf{u}} \neq \frac{\partial f_S}{\partial \mathbf{u}}$$

This leads to incorrectly designed control strategies.

## The Variety-Attenuator Problem

By the [[Law of Requisite Variety]], a regulator must have sufficient variety (complexity) to manage the variety in the system being regulated:

$$V_R \geq V_S - K$$

Where:
- $V_R$ is the variety of the regulator
- $V_S$ is the variety of the system
- $K$ is the variety reduction through constraints

Parametric mismodeling effectively reduces $V_R$, creating a variety deficit that manifests as an inability to reach desirable states.

## Information-Theoretic Perspective

The mismatch between model and reality can be quantified using the [[Kullback-Leibler divergence]]:

$$D_{KL}(P_S \| P_M) = \int_{\mathcal{X}} P_S(\mathbf{x}) \log\frac{P_S(\mathbf{x})}{P_M(\mathbf{x})} d\mathbf{x}$$

Where $P_S$ and $P_M$ are the probability distributions over states in the actual system and model, respectively.

This divergence represents the information loss when using $M$ to approximate $S$, directly relating to the severity of systemic problems.

## Cybernetic Feedback Loops

Systemic problems create [[second-order cybernetic]] challenges:

1. **Misattribution**: The regulator attributes failure to reach desirable states to external disturbances rather than model inadequacy
2. **Compensatory Actions**: The regulator adds complexity to its control strategy rather than improving its model
3. **Goal Distortion**: Eventually, the original desirable states are abandoned or redefined to match achievable outcomes

## Applications Across Domains

### Economic Policy

Central banks using misparameterized models of the economy create systemic problems:
- Incorrect Phillips curve parameterizations leading to simultaneous inflation and unemployment
- Mismodeled financial contagion parameters resulting in ineffective crisis interventions

### Healthcare Systems

Healthcare regulators operating with misparameterized models create:
- Iatrogenic illness through inappropriate interventions
- Resource misallocations due to incorrect understanding of disease dynamics
- Perverse incentives from mismodeled payment structures

### Educational Systems

Educational policies based on misparameterized models of learning lead to:
- Teaching to tests rather than developing actual competencies
- Curriculum designs misaligned with cognitive development
- Resource allocations that exacerbate rather than remedy inequalities

## Detection and Correction

### Model Inadequacy Testing

$$\chi^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}$$

Where $O_i$ are observed outcomes and $E_i$ are model-predicted outcomes.

### Bayesian Model Updating

$$P(\boldsymbol{\theta}_M | \mathbf{D}) \propto P(\mathbf{D} | \boldsymbol{\theta}_M) P(\boldsymbol{\theta}_M)$$

Where $\mathbf{D}$ is observed data from the actual system.

### Robust Control Theory

Design controllers that acknowledge model uncertainty:

$$\mathbf{u}^* = \arg\min_{\mathbf{u} \in \mathcal{U}} \max_{\boldsymbol{\theta} \in \Theta} \|\mathbf{x}(T, \boldsymbol{\theta}) - \mathbf{x}_d\|^2$$

## Philosophical Implications

The parameterization perspective connects to:
- [[Map-territory relation]] in epistemology
- [[Goodhart's Law]] in social systems
- [[Campbell's Law]] in performance measurement
- [[Ontological uncertainty]] in complex systems management

## Research Frontiers

1. Developing methods to quantify model-reality divergence in real-time
2. Creating adaptive regulatory frameworks that acknowledge fundamental uncertainty
3. Understanding the role of [[meta-modeling]] in effective regulation
4. Exploring the ethical dimensions of regulatory modeling choices
