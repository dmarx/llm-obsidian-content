Acquaintance Hypothesis


**ASSISTANT**

### Acquaintance Hypothesis

**Definition:** The acquaintance hypothesis is a response to the knowledge argument posed by Frank Jackson’s thought experiment, Mary's Room. It suggests that when Mary experiences color for the first time, she does not gain new propositional knowledge (knowledge-that), but rather becomes acquainted with new phenomenal knowledge (knowledge-how or acquaintance knowledge).

### Core Ideas

#### Propositional Knowledge vs. Acquaintance Knowledge

- **Propositional Knowledge (Knowledge-That):** This is factual knowledge, such as knowing that the sky is blue or that water is composed of hydrogen and oxygen.
- **Acquaintance Knowledge (Knowledge-How):** This type of knowledge refers to knowing what it is like to have a particular experience or to be directly acquainted with a sensory phenomenon.

The acquaintance hypothesis posits that Mary's new experience upon seeing color does not provide her with new propositional knowledge about the physical world. Instead, it provides her with a new kind of knowledge—acquaintance knowledge—of what it is like to see colors.

### Philosophical Implications

#### Addressing the Knowledge Argument

The knowledge argument suggests that physicalism is incomplete because Mary gains new knowledge (the experience of color) that she could not have learned from physical facts alone. The acquaintance hypothesis addresses this by differentiating the types of knowledge involved:

- **No New Propositional Knowledge:** Mary already knew all the physical facts about color vision; her new experience does not add to this body of propositional knowledge.
- **New Acquaintance Knowledge:** What Mary gains is a direct acquaintance with the experience of seeing red, which is a different kind of knowledge not captured by propositional knowledge.

#### Supporting Physicalism

By emphasizing the distinction between propositional knowledge and acquaintance knowledge, the acquaintance hypothesis aims to preserve the integrity of physicalism:

- **Physicalism Completeness:** Physicalism can be seen as complete in terms of propositional knowledge. The subjective experience (qualia) that Mary gains does not imply new physical facts but rather a different way of knowing the same facts.
- **Reduction of the Knowledge Argument:** The hypothesis reduces the impact of the knowledge argument by framing the new knowledge Mary gains as non-propositional, thereby maintaining that all factual knowledge about the world is physical.

### Criticisms of the Acquaintance Hypothesis

#### Qualitative Distinction

Critics argue that the acquaintance hypothesis may downplay the qualitative distinctiveness of Mary’s new experience. The sheer difference in experiencing color for the first time might still seem to introduce something fundamentally new that propositional knowledge cannot capture.

#### Persistence of the Explanatory Gap

Even with the acquaintance hypothesis, the [[explanatory gap]] between physical processes and subjective experience remains. Critics argue that explaining how physical processes produce qualia is still unresolved, regardless of the type of knowledge Mary gains.

### Examples

#### Practical Analogies

Consider learning to ride a bicycle:

- **Propositional Knowledge:** One might know all the physics and mechanics of riding a bicycle (e.g., balance, pedaling).
- **Acquaintance Knowledge:** Actually riding a bicycle provides a new type of experiential knowledge—what it feels like to balance and pedal—which cannot be fully conveyed through propositional knowledge alone.

### Summary

The acquaintance hypothesis offers a nuanced response to the knowledge argument by emphasizing the distinction between propositional knowledge and acquaintance knowledge. It suggests that while Mary gains new experiential knowledge upon seeing color for the first time, this does not constitute new propositional knowledge. This approach helps to defend physicalism by arguing that all propositional knowledge about the world remains within the domain of the physical, even as it acknowledges the unique nature of subjective experiences.
