Notable recent examples of the "Starve the Beast" strategy in contemporary U.S. politics primarily involve significant tax cuts enacted with the expectation or hope that they will lead to a reduction in government spending. Here are a couple of key examples from the last decade:

1. **The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017**: This major tax reform legislation, passed during the Trump administration, is a significant example of a "Starve the Beast" strategy. The act included substantial tax cuts for individuals and corporations, reducing the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and creating new tax brackets and rates for individuals. The rationale, in part, was that by reducing the federal revenue through these tax cuts, there would subsequently be a pressure to reduce federal spending. However, contrary to the "Starve the Beast" ideology, federal spending did not decrease in the years following the tax cuts. In fact, the federal deficit grew, and spending increased, partly due to increased military expenditures and entitlement programs that continued to grow【67†source】【68†source】.

2. **Budget Proposals and Discussions**: Various budget proposals from Republican lawmakers, including attempts by former House Speaker Paul Ryan, have reflected a "Starve the Beast" mentality. These proposals typically included significant cuts to entitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid, arguing that cutting federal spending was necessary to address the federal deficit exacerbated by tax cuts. While these proposals often did not become law, they reflect ongoing efforts aligned with the "Starve the Beast" strategy【67†source】【68†source】.

In both cases, the outcomes illustrate the challenges and complexities of implementing the "Starve the Beast" strategy effectively. Despite intentions to reduce government spending through lower tax revenues, actual legislative and economic dynamics have frequently led to increased federal deficits and sustained or increased government spending levels.

Certainly! Here are some specific details about budget proposals and discussions related to the "Starve the Beast" strategy, particularly those influenced by former House Speaker Paul Ryan:

### Paul Ryan's Budget Proposals

Paul Ryan, who served as the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives and was a prominent Republican lawmaker, was known for his budget plans, often referred to as the "Ryan Budgets." These proposals were significant for their approach to reforming major entitlement programs as a means to reduce federal spending:

1. **Path to Prosperity**: Ryan's most famous budget proposal, often called the "Path to Prosperity," was first introduced around 2011 and updated in subsequent years. It proposed dramatic changes to Medicare and Medicaid. The plan suggested transforming Medicare into a voucher-like system where future retirees would receive a fixed dollar amount to purchase health insurance. This was aimed at controlling the federal cost of Medicare over time.

2. **Medicaid Block Grants**: The Ryan Budget proposed converting Medicaid funding into block grants. This would give states a set amount of money rather than matching state spending with federal funds. The idea was to limit federal expenditure on Medicaid, giving states more flexibility to manage their programs but with less federal support.

3. **Non-Defense Discretionary Spending**: Ryan’s budgets often proposed significant reductions in non-defense discretionary spending, which includes a wide range of federal programs outside of defense and mandatory spending categories like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.

### Impact and Criticism

- **Deficit Reduction**: Ryan argued that his proposals were necessary to address the rapidly increasing federal deficit and overall national debt. He maintained that without significant reforms to entitlement programs, the fiscal health of the U.S. government would deteriorate.
  
- **Criticism from Democrats and Advocacy Groups**: These proposals were heavily criticized by Democrats and various advocacy groups who argued that they would strip away necessary benefits from vulnerable populations, including seniors and low-income families. Critics also contended that the savings from these cuts were often used to justify tax cuts, particularly for the wealthy, rather than to genuinely reduce the deficit.

- **Legislative Outcomes**: While Ryan’s budgets did pass the House of Representatives when Republicans had control, they were not adopted into law. The proposals served more as a statement of priorities and a vision for conservative fiscal policy rather than practical policy shifts, given the political reality of needing Senate approval and to avoid a presidential veto.

These specific aspects of Paul Ryan's budget proposals illustrate the practical application of the "Starve the Beast" philosophy in recent American politics. The strategy aims to force spending cuts by reducing the funds available, mainly through reforms to entitlement programs and other spending reductions, which were also intended to counterbalance the fiscal effects of tax cuts.
