### Hawk-Dove Game Overview

The Hawk-Dove game, also known as the Chicken or Snowdrift game in different contexts, is a fundamental model in [[Evolutionary Game Theory|evolutionary game theory]] that illustrates how aggressive and peaceful strategies compete and evolve in a population. The game models conflict over a shared resource and is used to analyze how different behaviors (Hawk vs. Dove) affect individual fitness and population dynamics.

### Game Setup and Payoffs

In the Hawk-Dove game, two individuals contest a resource. Each individual can adopt one of two strategies:
- **Hawk**: Aggressively fight for the resource.
- **Dove**: Display non-aggression; either share the resource or withdraw if faced with aggression.

The payoffs for each strategy depend on the opponent's actions:
- If Hawk meets Dove, the Hawk wins the resource without a fight, gaining a significant benefit ($V$), while the Dove gains nothing, avoiding injury.
- If Dove meets Dove, they share the resource, each receiving a benefit of $V/2$.
- If Hawk meets Hawk, they fight, with the winner gaining the resource ($V$) and the loser getting injured (cost $C$). The expected payoff for each Hawk in this scenario is $(V - C) / 2$.

The typical payoff matrix for this game, assuming $V = 1$ and $C = 2$, might look like this:

|        | Hawk | Dove  |
|--------|------|-------|
| **Hawk**  | $-0.5$  | $1$   |
| **Dove** | $0$    | $0.5$ |

### Analysis and Evolutionary Stable Strategies (ESS)

The ESS of the Hawk-Dove game depends on the values of $V$ (value of the resource) and $C$ (cost of conflict):

1. **If $C > V$ (cost of conflict exceeds the value of the resource)**: The best response to a Hawk (aggression) is to be a Dove (avoidance), and the best response to a Dove (sharing) is to be a Hawk (exploit). This typically results in a mixed ESS where each strategy is adopted with a certain probability that balances the population such that no one strategy can outright invade and replace the mixed strategy.

2. **If $C < V$**: Aggression (Hawk) might dominate if the benefit outweighs the cost significantly, though this is less common as unsustainable aggression can be detrimental to the population.

3. **Calculation of Mixed ESS**: The frequency of Hawks ($p$) and Doves ($1-p$) in the mixed ESS can be calculated where each strategy has the same payoff:

$$
p \cdot (V - C) / 2 + (1-p) \cdot V = p \cdot V
$$

Solving for $p$ gives the proportion of Hawks in the population as a function of $V$ and $C$:

$$
p = \frac{V}{C}
$$

This balance ensures that neither Hawks nor Doves can be better off by unilaterally changing their strategy.

### Applications

The Hawk-Dove game is widely used to model and understand conflict and cooperation in biological contexts, such as:
- Territorial disputes among animals.
- Behavioral strategies in mating and resource allocation.
- Human conflict and negotiation scenarios.

### Conclusion

The Hawk-Dove game is a powerful model for exploring how aggressive and peaceful strategies balance out in nature, providing insights into the evolution of behaviors based on the costs and benefits of conflict and cooperation. It is a classic example of how game theory intersects with evolutionary biology to explain complex social behaviors.
