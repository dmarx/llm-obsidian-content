Rapid wargaming techniques


**ASSISTANT**

**Rapid Wargaming Techniques** are streamlined methods used to quickly simulate and evaluate potential Courses of Action (COAs) in time-sensitive and dynamic operational environments. Unlike traditional, more detailed wargaming methods, rapid wargaming is designed to facilitate quick decision-making by focusing on the most critical elements of an operation, allowing commanders and staff to rapidly assess the feasibility, risks, and potential outcomes of different COAs. Rapid wargaming techniques are especially valuable in tactical situations where time is limited, and decisions need to be made quickly to maintain operational tempo and initiative.

## Objectives of Rapid Wargaming

1. **Facilitate Quick Decision-Making**: Enable commanders and staff to make timely decisions by rapidly evaluating COAs without extensive delays.
2. **Identify Key Risks and Opportunities**: Quickly assess potential risks, opportunities, and decision points associated with each COA to ensure that the chosen plan is both feasible and effective.
3. **Maintain Synchronization and Coordination**: Ensure that all actions are synchronized with the overall mission plan and aligned with the commander’s intent, even as adjustments are made in real-time.
4. **Enhance Flexibility and Adaptability**: Allow for rapid adjustments to plans based on real-time information and feedback from the operational environment.
5. **Support Commander's Intent**: Ensure that all decisions and actions remain aligned with the commander’s intent and contribute to achieving mission objectives.

## Key Principles of Rapid Wargaming

1. **Focus on Critical Elements**: Rapid wargaming concentrates on the most critical aspects of the operation, such as key tasks, decision points, and enemy actions, rather than detailed planning.
2. **Speed and Efficiency**: The process is designed to be fast and efficient, avoiding unnecessary detail and complexity to focus on key outcomes and decisions.
3. **Iterative Process**: Rapid wargaming allows for multiple iterations to refine COAs and adjust plans as needed based on evolving information and conditions.
4. **Commander-Centric**: The wargaming process is driven by the commander’s intent, with the staff providing analysis and recommendations to support the commander’s decision-making.
5. **Simplicity and Clarity**: Emphasizes simple and clear communication of key points and decisions to ensure that all participants understand the plan and can execute it effectively.

## Steps in Rapid Wargaming

Rapid wargaming typically involves a simplified version of the traditional wargaming process, focusing on key steps to quickly evaluate COAs and make informed decisions.

### 1. **Preparation**

**Purpose**: To quickly prepare the necessary materials and establish the context for the wargame.

- **Tasks**:
  - **Define the Objective**: Clearly define the purpose of the wargame, such as evaluating a specific COA or assessing a critical decision point.
  - **Select Participants**: Identify key participants, including the commander, key staff members, and subject matter experts relevant to the COA being wargamed.
  - **Gather Necessary Materials**: Quickly gather maps, overlays, intelligence reports, and any other materials needed to conduct the wargame.

- **Outputs**:
  - Clear understanding of the wargame’s objective and scope.
  - Key participants identified and briefed.
  - Materials and tools prepared for the wargame.

### 2. **Action-Reaction-Counteraction**

**Purpose**: To simulate the actions and reactions of friendly and enemy forces in a dynamic environment to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of the COA.

- **Tasks**:
  - **Identify Key Actions**: Identify the initial actions of friendly forces based on the COA being wargamed. Focus on key tasks and movements critical to the operation.
  - **Determine Enemy Reactions**: Predict the likely reactions of enemy forces to the friendly actions. Consider enemy capabilities, tactics, and intent.
  - **Assess Friendly Counteractions**: Develop potential counteractions that friendly forces could take in response to the enemy’s reactions. Consider alternative options and adjustments that could be made to the COA.

- **Outputs**:
  - A series of action-reaction-counteraction sequences for the COA being wargamed.
  - Identification of potential challenges, risks, and opportunities associated with the COA.
  - Quick assessment of the COA’s feasibility and effectiveness.

### 3. **Identify Decision Points and Critical Events**

**Purpose**: To identify key decision points and critical events that will impact the success of the COA and require command attention.

- **Tasks**:
  - **Highlight Decision Points**: Identify moments during the operation where critical decisions will need to be made, such as committing reserves or shifting the main effort.
  - **Determine Critical Events**: Identify events that could significantly impact the operation, such as enemy reinforcements, terrain obstacles, or logistical challenges.
  - **Assess Impact and Timing**: Evaluate the potential impact of these decision points and critical events on the overall operation and determine their timing.

## Techniques for Rapid Wargaming

1. **Mental Simulation**

**Mental Simulation** involves quickly visualizing the sequence of events in the mind, considering possible actions, reactions, and counteractions. This technique relies on the experience and intuition of the commander and staff to rapidly assess the feasibility and effectiveness of a COA.

- **Advantages**: Quick, requires minimal resources, and can be done on the fly.
- **Disadvantages**: Less detailed than other methods, potentially missing subtle details or risks.

2. **Tabletop Exercises**

**Tabletop Exercises** are informal discussions where participants use maps, charts, or sand tables to simulate the actions and reactions of friendly and enemy forces. These exercises are guided by a facilitator who helps participants quickly evaluate COAs and identify key decision points.

- **Advantages**: Allows for group input and discussion, quick to set up, and easy to adjust.
- **Disadvantages**: Can be less precise than digital simulations, may rely on subjective judgments.

3. **Quick Digital Simulations**

**Quick Digital Simulations** use software tools to rapidly model the operational environment and simulate the execution of a COA. These simulations can quickly incorporate variables such as terrain, weather, and enemy capabilities to provide a rapid assessment of COA viability.

- **Advantages**: Provides more data-driven analysis, can model complex interactions quickly.
- **Disadvantages**: Requires access to digital tools and some setup time.

4. **War-Gaming by Matrix**

**War-Gaming by Matrix** involves creating a matrix that lays out possible friendly and enemy actions and the corresponding outcomes. This method allows planners to quickly evaluate the potential results of different decisions and identify the most favorable COA.

- **Advantages**: Structured and systematic, easy to compare multiple COAs.
- **Disadvantages**: Can be oversimplified and may not capture all nuances.

5. **Action-Reaction Drill**

**Action-Reaction Drills** involve quickly running through the most likely actions of friendly and enemy forces and their immediate reactions. This is done rapidly and focuses on the most critical aspects of the COA to identify potential friction points and opportunities.

- **Advantages**: Fast-paced, focused on critical elements, and easy to repeat.
- **Disadvantages**: May overlook less obvious factors or longer-term considerations.
