feynman's path integral


**ASSISTANT**

**Feynman's Path Integral** is a formulation of quantum mechanics that expresses the probability amplitude for a quantum system to transition from one state to another as a sum (integral) over all possible paths that the system can take between these states. This approach was developed by [[Richard Feynman]] and provides a powerful alternative to the standard formulations of quantum mechanics, such as the Schrödinger equation and the Heisenberg matrix mechanics. The path integral formulation is particularly useful in quantum field theory and statistical mechanics, and it plays a central role in modern theoretical physics.

### Basics of the Path Integral Formulation

In the path integral approach, the quantum amplitude for a particle to travel from point $\mathbf{x}_i$ at time $t_i$ to point $\mathbf{x}_f$ at time $t_f$ is given by an integral over all possible paths $\mathbf{x}(t)$ that the particle could take between these points. The contribution of each path to the total amplitude is weighted by a phase factor $e^{iS[\mathbf{x}(t)]/\hbar}$, where $S[\mathbf{x}(t)]$ is the classical action associated with that path:

$$
\langle \mathbf{x}_f, t_f | \mathbf{x}_i, t_i \rangle = \int \mathcal{D}[\mathbf{x}(t)] \, e^{i S[\mathbf{x}(t)] / \hbar}.
$$

Here, $\mathcal{D}[\mathbf{x}(t)]$ denotes the measure for the integration over all possible paths $\mathbf{x}(t)$ from $\mathbf{x}_i$ to $\mathbf{x}_f$, and $S[\mathbf{x}(t)]$ is the action given by the time integral of the Lagrangian $L(\mathbf{x}(t), \dot{\mathbf{x}}(t))$ of the system:

$$
S[\mathbf{x}(t)] = \int_{t_i}^{t_f} L(\mathbf{x}(t), \dot{\mathbf{x}}(t)) \, dt.
$$

### The Classical Action and Path Integrals

The **action** $S[\mathbf{x}(t)]$ is a functional that, for a given path $\mathbf{x}(t)$, returns a scalar value. In classical mechanics, the path that a particle takes between two points is the one that makes the action stationary (the **Principle of Stationary Action**). However, in quantum mechanics, all paths contribute to the probability amplitude, but the paths close to the classical path (where the action is nearly stationary) contribute most constructively due to phase coherence.

### Derivation and Intuition

1. **Discretization**: To define the path integral more rigorously, one starts by discretizing time into $N$ intervals of size $\epsilon = (t_f - t_i)/N$. For each interval, the particle's position $\mathbf{x}(t)$ is approximated by a discrete set of points $\{\mathbf{x}_0, \mathbf{x}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_N\}$, where $\mathbf{x}_0 = \mathbf{x}_i$ and $\mathbf{x}_N = \mathbf{x}_f$.

2. **Action for Discrete Paths**: The action $S[\mathbf{x}(t)]$ for a discretized path is then approximated by a sum:

$$
S[\mathbf{x}(t)] \approx \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \epsilon \, L\left( \frac{\mathbf{x}_{n+1} + \mathbf{x}_n}{2}, \frac{\mathbf{x}_{n+1} - \mathbf{x}_n}{\epsilon} \right).
$$

3. **Path Integral in Discrete Form**: The transition amplitude becomes a multidimensional integral over all possible positions $\mathbf{x}_n$ at the intermediate times:

$$
\langle \mathbf{x}_f, t_f | \mathbf{x}_i, t_i \rangle = \lim_{N \to \infty} \int \prod_{n=1}^{N-1} d^d\mathbf{x}_n \, \exp\left( \frac{i}{\hbar} S[\mathbf{x}_n] \right),
$$

where $d$ is the number of spatial dimensions.

4. **Continuum Limit**: Taking the limit as $N \to \infty$ and $\epsilon \to 0$, the sum becomes an integral, and we obtain the formal expression for the path integral:

$$
\langle \mathbf{x}_f, t_f | \mathbf{x}_i, t_i \rangle = \int \mathcal{D}[\mathbf{x}(t)] \, e^{i S[\mathbf{x}(t)] / \hbar}.
$$

### Applications of the Path Integral Formulation

The path integral formulation provides several significant advantages and insights in both quantum mechanics and quantum field theory:

1. **Quantum Field Theory**: In quantum field theory (QFT), the path integral formalism is extended to fields instead of particles. The action $S$ is now a functional of field configurations $\phi(x)$, and the path integral sums over all possible field configurations:

   $$
   Z = \int \mathcal{D}[\phi(x)] \, e^{i S[\phi(x)] / \hbar},
   $$

   where $Z$ is the partition function or generating functional, and $\mathcal{D}[\phi(x)]$ represents the measure over field configurations. This framework naturally incorporates relativistic effects and is essential for the development of [[Quantum Electrodynamics]] (QED) and the Standard Model.

2. **Connection to Classical Mechanics**: In the classical limit $\hbar \to 0$, the phase oscillations become rapid for paths far from the classical path, leading to destructive interference. Thus, the path integral formulation recovers the classical principle of stationary action.

3. **Statistical Mechanics**: The path integral formulation also finds applications in statistical mechanics, where time evolution in quantum systems is analogized to evolution in "imaginary time" $\tau = it$. The partition function for a quantum system at temperature $T$ can be expressed as a path integral in imaginary time, linking quantum and statistical fields.

4. **Perturbation Theory and Feynman Diagrams**: The path integral provides a convenient basis for developing perturbative expansions, which are diagrammatically represented by [[Feynman Diagrams]]. These diagrams provide a visual and calculational method for understanding particle interactions in quantum field theories.

### Path Integral for a Free Particle

For a free particle of mass $m$, the Lagrangian is $L = \frac{1}{2} m \dot{\mathbf{x}}^2$. The classical action for a path $\mathbf{x}(t)$ between two points $(\mathbf{x}_i, t_i)$ and $(\mathbf{x}_f, t_f)$ is:

$$
S[\mathbf{x}(t)] = \int_{t_i}^{t_f} \frac{1}{2} m \dot{\mathbf{x}}^2 \, dt.
$$

The path integral for the free particle can be computed explicitly using Gaussian integrals, yielding the well-known quantum mechanical propagator:

$$
\langle \mathbf{x}_f, t_f | \mathbf{x}_i, t_i \rangle = \left( \frac{m}{2 \pi i \hbar (t_f - t_i)} \right)^{d/2} \exp \left( \frac{i m (\mathbf{x}_f - \mathbf{x}_i)^2}{2 \hbar (t_f - t_i)} \right).
$$

This result shows the amplitude for a free particle to move from $\mathbf{x}_i$ to $\mathbf{x}_f$ in time $t_f - t_i$.

### Conclusion

Feynman's Path Integral formulation of quantum mechanics is a profound generalization of classical principles to the quantum domain, offering a framework that is especially powerful in field theory and in describing systems with an infinite number of degrees of freedom. Its flexibility and deep connection to classical action principles make it a cornerstone of modern theoretical physics, providing tools and insights across quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, and statistical mechanics.
