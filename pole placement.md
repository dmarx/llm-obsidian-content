Pole Placement

### Pole Placement

Pole placement is a [[control system design]] technique that allows engineers to place the closed-loop poles of a system at desired locations in the complex plane. This method is particularly useful in state-space control design for achieving specific performance criteria such as stability, damping, and transient response.

### Key Concepts

1. **Closed-Loop Poles**: The poles of the system's closed-loop transfer function, which determine the stability and dynamic response of the system.
2. **State Feedback**: A control strategy where the control input is a linear combination of the state variables.
3. **Controllability**: A property that determines whether it is possible to move the system from any initial state to any desired final state within finite time using appropriate control inputs.

### State-Space Representation

Consider a linear time-invariant (LTI) system in state-space form:

$$
\dot{x}(t) = A x(t) + B u(t),
$$

$$
y(t) = C x(t) + D u(t),
$$

where:
- \( x(t) \) is the state vector.
- \( u(t) \) is the control input.
- \( y(t) \) is the output.
- \( A \) is the state matrix.
- \( B \) is the input matrix.
- \( C \) is the output matrix.
- \( D \) is the feedthrough (or direct transmission) matrix.

### State Feedback Control Law

In state feedback control, the control input \( u(t) \) is designed as:

$$
u(t) = -K x(t) + r(t),
$$

where:
- \( K \) is the state feedback gain matrix.
- \( r(t) \) is the reference input.

The closed-loop system dynamics are then given by:

$$
\dot{x}(t) = (A - BK)x(t) + Br(t).
$$

### Controllability

Before applying pole placement, it is essential to ensure that the system is controllable. The controllability matrix \( \mathcal{C} \) is:

$$
\mathcal{C} = [B \ AB \ A^2B \ \ldots \ A^{n-1}B],
$$

where \( n \) is the number of states. The system is controllable if \( \mathcal{C} \) has full rank (i.e., rank \( n \)).

### Desired Pole Locations

Choose the desired locations for the closed-loop poles based on the performance specifications. These poles determine the transient response, stability, and damping of the system.

### Pole Placement Procedure

1. **Determine the Characteristic Polynomial**: For the desired pole locations, determine the desired characteristic polynomial.

2. **Compute the Feedback Gain Matrix \( K \)**: Use the desired characteristic polynomial to compute the state feedback gain matrix \( K \) that places the closed-loop poles at the desired locations.

### Example: Pole Placement Design

Consider a system with the [[state-space representation]]:

$$
\dot{x}(t) = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -2 & -3 \end{bmatrix} x(t) + \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} u(t),
$$

$$
y(t) = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} x(t).
$$

#### Step 1: Check Controllability

The controllability matrix is:

$$
\mathcal{C} = \begin{bmatrix} B & AB \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & -3 \end{bmatrix}.
$$

Since \( \det(\mathcal{C}) = -1 \neq 0 \), the system is controllable.

#### Step 2: Desired Pole Locations

Assume we want the closed-loop poles to be at \( -2 \) and \( -3 \). The desired characteristic polynomial is:

$$
(s + 2)(s + 3) = s^2 + 5s + 6.
$$

#### Step 3: Compute the Feedback Gain Matrix \( K \)

The characteristic polynomial of the closed-loop system with state feedback is:

$$
\det(sI - (A - BK)) = s^2 + (a_{11} + a_{22} - k_1)s + (a_{11}a_{22} - a_{12}a_{21} - a_{22}k_1 + b_{2}k_2).
$$

For the given system:

$$
\dot{x}(t) = (A - BK)x(t),
$$

where \( K = \begin{bmatrix} k_1 & k_2 \end{bmatrix} \).

Substitute \( A \) and \( B \) and match coefficients with the desired characteristic polynomial:

$$
A - BK = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -2 & -3 \end{bmatrix} - \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} k_1 & k_2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -2 - k_1 & -3 - k_2 \end{bmatrix}.
$$

The characteristic equation is:

$$
s^2 + (3 + k_2)s + (2 + k_1) = s^2 + 5s + 6.
$$

Matching coefficients:

$$
3 + k_2 = 5 \implies k_2 = 2,
$$

$$
2 + k_1 = 6 \implies k_1 = 4.
$$

So, the state feedback gain matrix is:

$$
K = \begin{bmatrix} 4 & 2 \end{bmatrix}.
$$

### Full-State Feedback Controller

For the given system:

$$
u(t) = -Kx(t) + r(t) = -\begin{bmatrix} 4 & 2 \end{bmatrix} x(t) + r(t).
$$

### Implementing Pole Placement in MATLAB

Here's a MATLAB example to perform pole placement:

```matlab
% Define the state-space matrices
A = [0 1; -2 -3];
B = [0; 1];
C = [1 0];
D = 0;

% Desired closed-loop pole locations
desired_poles = [-2 -3];

% Compute the state feedback gain matrix K
K = place(A, B, desired_poles);

% Display the gain matrix K
disp('State feedback gain matrix K:');
disp(K);

% Simulate the closed-loop system
sys_cl = ss(A - B*K, B, C, D);

% Step response of the closed-loop system
figure;
step(sys_cl);
title('Step Response of the Closed-Loop System');
```

### Conclusion

Pole placement is a powerful technique in state feedback control that allows for precise control over the closed-loop system dynamics. By placing the poles at desired locations, engineers can achieve specific performance criteria, such as stability, transient response, and damping.
