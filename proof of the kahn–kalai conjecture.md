A PROOF OF THE KAHN–KALAI CONJECTURE
JINYOUNG PARK AND HUY TUAN PHAM
ABSTRACT. Proving the “expectation-threshold” conjecture of Kahn and Kalai, we show that for any increasing
property F on a finite set X,
pc(F) = O(q(F) log `(F)),
where pc(F) and q(F) are the threshold and “expectation threshold” of F, and `(F) is the maximum of 2 and
the maximum size of a minimal member of F.
1. INTRODUCTION
Given a finite set X, write 2
X for the power set of X. For p ∈ [0, 1], let µp be the product measure on 2
X
given by µp(A) = p
|A|
(1 − p)
|X\A|
. In this paper F ⊆ 2
X always denotes an increasing property, meaning
that if B ⊇ A ∈ F, then B ∈ F. We say that an increasing property F is nontrivial if F 6= ∅, 2
X. It is a
well-known fact that µp(F)(:= P
A∈F µp(A)) is continuous and strictly increasing in p for any nontrivial
increasing property F. The threshold, pc(F), is then the unique p for which µp(F) = 1/2. In this paper,
we resolve a conjecture of Kahn and Kalai [16], reiterated by Talagrand [23], relating the threshold and the
”expectation-threshold” (definition is below).
Following [23], we say F is p-small if there is G ⊆ 2
X such that
F ⊆ hGi := [
S∈G
{T : T ⊇ S} (1)
and
X
S∈G
p
|S| ≤ 1/2. (2)
We say that G is a cover of F if (1) holds. The expectation-threshold of F, q(F), is defined to be the maximum
p such that F is p-small. Observe that q(F) is a trivial lower bound on pc(F), since
µp(F) ≤ µp(hGi) ≤
X
S∈G
p
|S|
. (3)
Note that, with Xp the random variable whose distribution is µp, the right-hand side of (3) is E[|{S ∈ G :
S ⊆ Xp}|].
Given an increasing property F, let `0(F) be the size of a largest minimal element of F, and let `(F) =
max(`0(F), 2). Our main theorem resolves the following conjecture of Kahn and Kalai [16].
Theorem 1.1 (The Kahn-Kalai Conjecture). There is a universal constant K such that for every finite set X and
nontrivial increasing property F ⊆ 2
X,
pc(F) ≤ Kq(F) log `(F).

Roughly speaking, Theorem 1.1 says that for any increasing property, the threshold is never far from its
trivial lower bound given by the expectation threshold.
Thresholds have been a central subject in the study of random discrete structures since its initiation
by Erdos and R ˝ enyi [ ´ 6, 7], the study of which has flourished in random graph theory, computer science
[17, 23], and statistical physics [12]. The definition of the threshold above is finer than the original Erdos- ˝
Renyi notion, according to which ´ p
∗ = p
∗
(n) is a threshold for F = Fn if µp(F) → 0 when p  p
∗ and
µp(F) → 1 when p  p
∗
. That pc(F) is always an Erdos-R ˝ enyi threshold follows from [ ´ 4], in which it was
observed that every increasing F admits a threshold in the Erdos-R ˝ enyi sense. While much work has been ´
done identifying thresholds for specific properties (see [3, 14]), another intensively studied direction in the
study of thresholds is “sharpness” of thresholds: we refer interested readers to [10, 11].
To emphasize the strength of Theorem 1.1, we point out that, in [16], Kahn and Kalai wrote that “It would
probably be more sensible to conjecture that it is not true.” The expectation threshold is the most naive
(and often the easiest) approach to estimating the threshold, and Theorem 1.1 says that for every nontrivial
increasing property, its threshold is only within a logarithmic factor of this naive estimate. In particular,
many important works in this area have been on thresholds for specific properties, and Theorem 1.1 easily
implies some of those very hard results on the location of thresholds, for example, the appearance of perfect
matchings in random r-uniform hypergraphs in seminal work of Johansson, Kahn and Vu [15], and the
appearance of a given bounded degree spanning tree in a random graph in recent work of Montgomery
[19] (we note that Montgomery shows a stronger “universality” result that above the correct threshold we
actually have containment of all bounded degree spanning trees, which is not recoverable from Theorem
1.1). For more discussion on the significance and applications of this theorem, we refer the readers to [8], in
which a weaker fractional relaxation of Theorem 1.1 was proved.
Two recent breakthroughs related to Theorem 1.1 are the significant progress on the Erdos-Rado sun- ˝
flower conjecture by Alweiss, Lovett, Wu and Zhang [1] and the resolution of the fractional Kahn-Kalai
conjecture by Frankston, Kahn, Narayanan and the first author [8]. The main lemma of [1] gives a sufficient
condition to guarantee that Xp likely satisfies an increasing property, and is shown via a beautiful argument
inspired from ideas in Razborov’s proof [21] of Hastad’s switching lemma [ ˚ 13]. In [8], the authors observed
the relevance of the developments in [1] to thresholds and used an improved version of the argument in [1],
achieved via separating typical “non-pathological” and atypical “pathological” cases, to establish Theorem
1.2 below. Theorem 1.2 is a sharper version of the main lemma of [1] and a weaker version of Theorem 1.1.
We say F is weakly p-small if there is a λ : 2V → R
+ (:= [0, ∞)) such that
X
S⊆F
λS ≥ 1 for all F ∈ F (4)
and
X
S
λSp
|S| ≤ 1/2. (5)
Note that if we restrict the range of λ to {0, 1}, then we would recover the definition of the p-small property.
Define qf (F) = max{p : F is weakly p-small} to be the fractional expectation-threshold of F. It follows from
the definitions that
q(F) ≤ qf (F) ≤ pc(F), (6)
2
and the main theorem of [8] resolves the following conjecture of Talagrand [23, Conjecture 8.5], which is a
weakening of Theorem 1.1.
Theorem 1.2. There is a universal K such that for every finite X and nontrivial increasing F ⊆ 2
X,
pc(F) < Kqf (F) log `(F).
Talagrand [23, Conjecture 6.3] also conjectured that the parameters q and qf are in fact always of the same
order:
Conjecture 1.3. There is an absolute constant L > 0 such that, for any nontrivial increasing F, q(F) ≥ qf (F)/L.
This of course implies equivalence of Theorems 1.1 and 1.2, and up until now, proving Conjecture 1.3 has
been regarded as the most likely direction to prove Theorem 1.1. However, as Talagrand observes, even
simple instances of Conjecture 1.3 are not easy to establish. The two “test cases” suggested by Talagrand,
which are now proved respectively in [5] and [9], already necessitate nontrivial arguments, and proving
the full version of the conjecture is considered as a much harder task.
Our proof of Theorem 1.1 takes a surprisingly simple and direct approach rather than the indirect approach suggested by Conjecture 1.3. Part of our proof is inspired by the argument in [1, 8], though our
implementation is significantly different from the ideas in previous works [1, 8, 18]. In all of those papers,
the notion of “spread” plays a key role in the proofs. In particular, it provides the starting point of the proof
of Theorem 1.2 using linear programming duality, while in the setting of Theorem 1.1, where one cannot exploit linear programming duality, this starting point immediately disappears. In the proof of Theorem 1.1,
we completely avoid the use of spread, which is the essential workhorse of the proofs in [1, 8, 18]. This is
one of the most surprising points of our proof. A key technical insight in our proof is the notion of minimum
fragments. With the minimum fragments, our proof allows to utilize a direct argument in the spirit of [1],
thus giving a simplified proof of the main lemma of [8] as well as the main result of [18] without separating
pathological cases. It also suggests a clear intuition behind the linear relation between pc(F) and q(F); see
Remark 2.2 and a recent paper by Bell and Frieze [2].
The use of minimum fragments in the present paper is in fact inspired by our resolution [20] of a conjecture of Talagrand ([22, Problem 4.1], [23, Conjecture 5.7] and [24, Research Problem 13.2.3]) and a question
of Talagrand ([25] and a problem posed in [22]). The argument in [20] uses a significantly more delicate
and elaborate argument that shares some ideas with those in this paper. Importantly, even to address the
weaker fractional relaxation version of these conjectures and questions of Talagrand, we need to use the
full strength of the ideas in this paper as well as additional ideas in [20].
Reformulation. In Section 2 we prove Theorem 1.4 below, which implies Theorem 1.1.
A hypergraph on X is a collection H of subsets of X, and a set in the collection H is called an edge of H.
We say H is `-bounded if each of its edges has size at most `. Recall that hHi =
S
S∈H{T : T ⊇ S}. Note
that we can extend the definition of p-small to H without any modification. For an integer m, we use an
m-subset of X for a subset of X of size m, and Xm for a uniformly random m-subset of X.
Theorem 1.4. Let ` ≥ 2. There is a universal constant L such that for any nonempty `-bounded hypergraph H on
X that is not p-small,
a uniformly random ((Lp log `)|X|)-element subset of X belongs to hHi with probability 1 − o`→∞(1). (7)
3
Remark 1.5. It is easy to see from the proof that one can obtain a quantitative bound for the o`→∞(1) term of the
form (log `)
−c
for c > 0.
Derivation of Theorem 1.1 from Theorem 1.4. Let F be as in Theorem 1.1. We assume Theorem 1.4 and derive
that if q > q(F) then, with p = Kq log `(F) (K is a universal constant to be determined), we have P(Xp ∈
F) > 1/2. Here, we recall that for 0 ≤ p ≤ 1, we denote by Xp the random variable with distribution µp.
Let H be the set of minimal elements of F (so hHi = F). Then H is `(F)-bounded and not q-small
(since q > q(F)). Let C be a (universal) constant for which, with ` = C`(F), the exceptional probability in
Theorem 1.4 is less than 1/4.
Let m = (Lq log `)|X| and p
0 = 2Lq log `, and choose K sufficiently large so that p ≥ p
0
. Theorem 1.1
vacuously holds if p
0 > 1, so we can assume that p
0 ≤ 1, in which case
P(Xp0 ∈ hHi) ≥ P(Xm ∈ hHi) P(|Xp0 | ≥ m) ≥ (3/4) P(|Xp0 | ≥ m) > 1/2,
where the last inequality follows from standard concentration bound, upon noting that H is not q-small
implies |X|q > 1/2 (since {{x} : x ∈ X} covers H) and hence m > (Llog `)/2 (so is somewhat large). This
concludes the derivation.
Notations and Conventions. All logarithms are base 2 unless specified otherwise. We have not made an
attempt to optimize the absolute constants. For the sake of clarity of presentation, we omit floor and ceiling
signs when they are not essential.
2. PROOF OF THEOREM 1.4
Before going through the proof in detail, we first give an informal overview of our strategy. A hypergraph H is p-small if H admits a “cheap” cover, where being cheap refers to the condition in (2). Our proof
uses a randomized iterative process. Starting with H0 = H, at the ith step for i ≥ 1, we assume that we have
some hypergraph Hi−1 produced from the (i − 1)th step for which |Si−1| ≤ 0.9
i−1
` for all Si−1 ∈ Hi−1, and
consider Wi which is a random subset of X \ (
S
1≤j<i Wj ) of size wi ≈ Lpn (we will see later in the proof
that for the purpose of producing a tail bound going to 0 with `, it is helpful to choose slightly larger wi
towards the last iterations). We will show that there is a sub-hypergraph Gi of Hi−1 that admits a cover Ui
which has small cost with high probability, as well as a hypergraph Hi with the following key properties:
Hi−1 \ Gi ⊆ hHii, (8)
(
[
j≤i
Wj ) ∪ Si ∈ hHi for all Si ∈ Hi
, and (9)
|Si
| ≤ 0.9
i
` for all Si ∈ Hi
. (10)
The choices of Gi
, Ui and Hi depend on Wi
. In the (i + 1)th step we repeat our process with the hypergraph
Hi
. Property (8) reduces the task of finding a cover of the “leftover” Hi−1 \ Gi to finding a cover of Hi
.
Property (10) implies that for γ > log0.9
(1/`), either Hγ is empty, or Hγ only contains the empty set. In
the former case, one can check that S
i Ui
is a cover of H; and in the latter case, one has from (9) that
W =
S
i Wi ∈ hHi. Since H does not admit a cheap cover (as it does not satisfy (2)), and the cover S
i Ui
has small cost with high probability, we conclude that W ∈ hHi with high probability. Theorem 1.4 then
follows.
4
In Section 2.1 we describe our construction of the cheap cover U = Ui (in each step), and in Section 2.2
we analyze our iteration, concluding our proof.
2.1. Constructing a cover. We use n for |X|. Let L be large enough to support our conclusion and let H
be `-bounded. In the following argument, we always assume that S, S0
, S00
, Sˆ ∈ H and W ∈
X
w

, where
w := Lpn (as usual, X
w

is the collection of w-subsets of X).
The following notion of a minimum fragment is key in our proof. Given S and W, we say that T = T(S, W)
is a minimum (S, W)-fragment if T is the set of the smallest size (possibly empty) such that T can be written
as S
0 \ W for some S
0 ∈ H with S
0 ⊆ W ∪ S (breaking ties arbitrarily). Note that such S
0
exists as S ∈ H
and S ⊆ W ∪ S. We use t = t(S, W) for |T(S, W)|.
Given W, G = G(W) is the collection of S whose minimum fragment with respect to W is “large;”
formally,
G(W) := {S ∈ H : t(S, W) ≥ 0.9`}.
Then we define U(W), a cover of G(W), as
U(W) := {T(S, W) : S ∈ G(W)}
(the fact that U(W) covers G(W) follows since each minimum fragment T(S, W) is a subset of S).
Note that the edges in H \ G(W) are not necessarily covered by U(W). We define
H0 = H0
(W) = {T(S, W) : S ∈ H \ G(W)}; (11)
the hypergraph H0
, which is .9`-bounded, will be the host hypergraph in the next iteration step (see (19)).
Note that H \ G(W) ⊆ hH0
i (as promised in (8)), so in particular,
a cover of H0 also covers H \ G(W). (12)
The following lemma is our key lemma, which says that the cover U(W) of G(W) has small cost with
high probability (over the randomness of W).

Proof of (14). Given W and m ≥ 0.9`, let
Gm(W) := {S ∈ H : t(S, W) = m}
and
Um(W) := {T(S, W) : S ∈ Gm(W)}.
Note that for any U ∈ Um(W) we have |U| = m, so P

. (15)
We bound the number of choices of W and T = T(S, W)’s in the collection in (15) using the following
specification steps.
Step 1. Pick Z := W ∪ T. Since |Z| = w + m (note W and T are always disjoint), the number of possibilities
for Z is at most (recalling w = Lpn)

Step 2. Note that Z (= W ∪ T) must contain an edge of H by the definition of minimum fragment. Make a
choice of Sˆ ⊆ Z arbitrarily so that the choice of Sˆ only depends on Z. In particular, the choice of Sˆ
is free given Z. Here a crucial observation is that, since T(S, W) is a minimum fragment,
T ⊆ S. ˆ (16)
Indeed, since Sˆ is contained in T ∪ W ⊆ S ∪ W, the failure of (16) implies that Sˆ ⊂ S ∪ W has
|Sˆ \ W| < |T|, contradicting the minimality of T.
The property (16) enables us to specify T as a subset of Sˆ, the number of possibilities of which is
at most 2
`
.
Note that (W, T) is determined upon fixing a choice of Z and T. In sum, we have

Remark 2.2. The proofs of the main lemma of [1] and [8, 18] also use similar-looking specification steps. By replacing
their definition of Z (:= W ∪ S) with the one in the above proof (Z := W ∪ T), one can remove the “pathological”
case analysis in [8, 18] and thus obtain a simplification of the argument there.
2.2. Iteration. Recall that n = |X|, ` → ∞, and L is a large constant. Let γ = blog0.9
(1/`)c + 1. In the
following definitions, i = 1, 2, . . . , γ. Let `i = 0.9
i
` and note that
0.9 ≤ `γ < 1. (17)
Let X0 = X and Wi be uniform from Xi−1
wi

, where Xi = Xi−1 \ Wi and wi = Lipn with
Li =



At the end, W := Sγ
i=1 Wi
is a uniformly random (CLp log `)n-subset of X where C ≤ C

for some absolute
constant C
0 > 0. Note that there is an absolute constant c > 0 for which
`i > exp(c
√
log `) for all i < γ −
p
log0.9
(1/`). (18)
By iteratively applying our argument in Section 2.1, we produce a sequence {Hi} with H0 = H and
Hi = H0
i−1
(19)
(see (11) to recall the definition of H0
). Note that each Hi
is `i-bounded, and associated to each set Wi
in
step i, we have Gi = Gi(Wi) ⊆ Hi−1 and a cover Ui = Ui(Wi) of Gi
. Properties (8), (10), and inductively
Property (9), can be easily verified from our construction of Gi
, Ui and Hi
. Indeed, assuming that Property
(9) holds for Hi−1, then, since each hyperedge Si ∈ Hi has the form Si = T(Si−1, Wi) = S
0
i−1
\ Wi for some
Si−1, S0
i−1 ∈ Hi−1, we have
(

i−1 \ Wi) ⊇ (
[
j≤i−1

i−1 ∈ hHi.
Proposition 2.3. We have that either W ∈ hHi or U := S
i≤γ U(Wi) covers H.
Proof. Note that `γ < 1, hence either Hγ = ∅ or Hγ = {∅}.
In the former case (Hγ = ∅), we show that U covers H. Indeed, for S ∈ H, let S = S0, S1, S2, . . . (Si ∈ Hi)
be the evolution of S in the iteration process, i.e., Si
:= T(Si−1, Wi). In each iteration, either Si ∈ Gi and is
covered by Ui
, or otherwise, Si+1 ∈ Hi+1. Since Hγ = ∅, there exists j < γ for which Sj ∈ Gj . Hence, S is
covered by U.
In the latter case (Hγ = {∅}), we show that W ∈ hHi. Indeed, by Property (9), W1 ∪ . . . ∪ Wγ ∪ ∅ ∈ hHi,
and hence W ∈ hHi.
Let E be the event that U covers H. By Proposition 2.3, we have
P(W ∈ hHi) + P(E) ≥ 1;
equivalently,
P(W ∈ hHi) ≥ 1 − P(E).
To bound P(E), note that the expected “cost” for the cover U is

## Proof of the Kahn–Kalai Conjecture

In their paper "A Proof of the Kahn–Kalai Conjecture," Jinyoung Park and Huy Tuan Pham provide a detailed proof of the expectation-threshold conjecture formulated by Kahn and Kalai. The conjecture relates the threshold \( p_c(\mathcal{F}) \) and the expectation-threshold \( q(\mathcal{F}) \) of an increasing property \(\mathcal{F}\) on a finite set \(X\). Here, we will summarize the main results and the proof structure.

### Key Concepts

1. **Increasing Property**: A family \(\mathcal{F} \subseteq 2^X\) is increasing if \(A \subseteq B\) and \(A \in \mathcal{F}\) imply \(B \in \mathcal{F}\).

2. **Threshold**: \( p_c(\mathcal{F}) \) is the probability \(p\) at which the property \(\mathcal{F}\) has a probability of \(1/2\) under the product measure \(\mu_p\), where each element of \(X\) is included independently with probability \(p\).

3. **Expectation-Threshold**: \( q(\mathcal{F}) \) is the maximum \(p\) such that there exists a cover \(G \subseteq 2^X\) satisfying \( \mathcal{F} \subseteq \langle G \rangle \) and \( \sum_{S \in G} p^{|S|} \leq 1/2 \).

4. **Minimal Elements**: The size of the largest minimal element in \(\mathcal{F}\) is denoted as \(\ell_0(\mathcal{F})\), and \(\ell(\mathcal{F}) = \max(\ell_0(\mathcal{F}), 2)\).

### The Main Theorem

**Theorem 1.1 (Kahn–Kalai Conjecture)**: There exists a universal constant \( K \) such that for every finite set \(X\) and nontrivial increasing property \(\mathcal{F} \subseteq 2^X\),
$$
p_c(\mathcal{F}) \leq K q(\mathcal{F}) \log \ell(\mathcal{F}).
$$

### Proof Outline

The proof revolves around showing that the threshold \( p_c(\mathcal{F}) \) is bounded above by a function of the expectation-threshold \( q(\mathcal{F}) \) and the logarithm of the maximum size of a minimal member of \(\mathcal{F}\).

#### Key Steps in the Proof

1. **Hypergraph Representation**: The proof utilizes a hypergraph \( H \) to represent the increasing property \(\mathcal{F}\). Each edge in the hypergraph corresponds to a minimal member of \(\mathcal{F}\).

2. **Randomized Iterative Process**: A randomized iterative process is used to construct a sequence of hypergraphs \( H_i \) where each step reduces the size of the minimal elements. This involves selecting random subsets and constructing covers with small cost.

3. **Minimum Fragments**: The notion of minimum fragments \( T(S, W) \) is introduced to facilitate the construction of covers. These are subsets of minimal elements that are not too small and can be used to cover the remaining elements in subsequent iterations.

4. **Bounding the Cost of Covers**: Lemma 2.1 establishes that the expected cost of the cover \( U(W) \) of \( H_i \) is small with high probability. This is achieved through careful probabilistic analysis and combinatorial arguments.

5. **Concentration Bounds**: Using standard concentration inequalities, the proof shows that the probability of a random subset belonging to the cover \( \langle H \rangle \) is high, ensuring that the property \(\mathcal{F}\) is satisfied with high probability for the appropriate choice of \( p \).

6. **Final Bound**: Combining the results from the iterative process and concentration bounds, the main theorem is derived by showing that \( p_c(\mathcal{F}) \) is within a logarithmic factor of \( q(\mathcal{F}) \).

### Significance and Implications

The proof of the Kahn–Kalai conjecture provides a significant advancement in the understanding of thresholds in random discrete structures. It shows that the threshold for any increasing property is closely tied to its expectation-threshold, a much more easily computable quantity. This result has far-reaching implications in various areas such as random graph theory, computer science, and statistical physics.

The result implies that for many important properties, the naive expectation-threshold provides a good approximation of the actual threshold, simplifying the analysis of random structures.
