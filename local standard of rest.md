# Local Standard of Rest

The [[Local Standard of Rest]] (LSR) represents a theoretical reference frame in which the mean motion of stars in the immediate solar neighborhood averages to zero. This construct is fundamental to [[stellar kinematics]] and [[galactic dynamics]].

## Mathematical Definition

Consider a local volume V centered on the Sun's position. The LSR velocity $\vec{v}_{LSR}$ is defined by:

```
\vec{v}_{LSR} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \vec{v}_i = 0
```
where:
- $\vec{v}_i$ represents individual stellar velocities relative to the LSR
- N is the number of stars in volume V
- The sum is taken over all stars of a specific [[stellar population]]

## Types of LSR

### [[Dynamical LSR]]

Defined by forces:
```
\nabla \Phi_{gal}(\vec{r}_{LSR}) \times \vec{v}_{LSR} = 0
```
where $\Phi_{gal}$ is the [[galactic potential]].

### [[Kinematical LSR]]

Based on observed stellar motions:
```
\langle U \rangle = \langle V \rangle = \langle W \rangle = 0
```
for local stars.

## Solar Motion

The Sun's velocity relative to the LSR (solar motion) is typically decomposed as:
```
\vec{v}_⊙ = (U_⊙, V_⊙, W_⊙)
```
Modern values (in km/s):
- U_⊙ ≈ 11.1 (toward galactic center)
- V_⊙ ≈ 12.2 (in direction of rotation)
- W_⊙ ≈ 7.3 (toward north galactic pole)

## Applications

### [[Velocity Corrections]]

For observed velocities:
```
\vec{v}_{LSR} = \vec{v}_{helio} + \vec{v}_⊙
```

### [[Asymmetric Drift]]

Systematic lag of stellar populations:
```
v_a = \langle V_{LSR} \rangle - v_c
```
where v_c is the [[circular velocity]].

## Statistical Properties

### [[Velocity Dispersion]]

Characterized by:
```
σ_i² = \frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{j=1}^N (v_{i,j})²
```
for each component i.

### [[Age-Velocity Relation]]

Dispersion increases with stellar age:
```
σ_i ∝ t^α
```
where α ≈ 0.2-0.5.

## Methodological Considerations

### [[Reference Population Selection]]

Critical factors:
- [[Metallicity]] distribution
- [[Age]] distribution
- [[Spatial distribution]]
- [[Kinematic bias]]

### [[Systematic Effects]]

Major sources:
- [[Vertex Deviation]]
- [[Phase Space Substructure]]
- [[Selection Effects]]
- [[Measurement Uncertainties]]

## Modern Applications

### [[Galactic Structure]]

Used in studies of:
- [[Spiral Arms]]
- [[Resonances]]
- [[Bar Dynamics]]
- [[Dark Matter Distribution]]

### [[Stellar Populations]]

Analysis of:
- [[Moving Groups]]
- [[Stellar Streams]]
- [[Kinematic Substructure]]
- [[Population Gradients]]
