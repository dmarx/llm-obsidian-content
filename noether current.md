Noether current


**ASSISTANT**

The concept of the Noether current is deeply tied to [[Noether's Theorem|Noether's theorem]], one of the most profound results in theoretical physics and the calculus of variations. Named after Emmy Noether, the theorem elucidates the fundamental connection between symmetries and conservation laws. In this context, a Noether current is associated with a specific kind of symmetry of the action of a physical system and corresponds to a conserved quantity.

### Background

To fully appreciate the Noether current, it's crucial to understand the principle of least action, which is a cornerstone in the formulation of classical mechanics, field theory, and quantum mechanics. The action, $S$, is defined as the integral over time of a Lagrangian, $L$, which itself is a function of the generalized coordinates, their derivatives, and possibly time:

$$S = \int L(q_i, \dot{q}_i, t) dt$$

The principle of least action states that the path taken by a system between two states is the one for which the action $S$ is stationary (usually a minimum).

### Noether's Theorem and Conservation

Noether's theorem states that for every continuous symmetry of the action, there is a corresponding conserved quantity. Continuous symmetry means that the action does not change under a continuous transformation of the system's coordinates and fields.

A Noether current, $J^\mu$, is a conserved current derived from this symmetry. The conservation law is expressed as:

$$\partial_\mu J^\mu = 0$$

where $\partial_\mu$ denotes the four-dimensional partial derivative with respect to spacetime coordinates, and $\mu$ runs over the spacetime indices (0 for time, and 1-3 for spatial dimensions in a 4-dimensional spacetime). This equation signifies that the Noether current is conserved throughout the spacetime evolution of the system.

### Mathematical Formulation

Consider a field $\phi(x)$ and its infinitesimal transformation $\delta\phi(x)$ that leaves the action invariant. The Noether current associated with this transformation can be expressed as:

$$J^\mu = \frac{\partial L}{\partial(\partial_\mu \phi)} \delta \phi - F^\mu$$

where $L$ is the Lagrangian density, $\frac{\partial L}{\partial(\partial_\mu \phi)}$ is the functional derivative of $L$ with respect to the derivative of the field, and $F^\mu$ is a function that compensates for any explicit coordinate dependence in the transformation. 

### Examples

1. **[[Translation Symmetry and Momentum Conservation|Translation Symmetry]]**: For a system invariant under spatial translations, the Noether current is the momentum density of the system. Conservation of momentum is the corresponding conserved quantity.

2. **[[Rotational Symmetry and Angular Momentum Conservation|Rotational Symmetry]]**: Invariance under rotation leads to conservation of angular momentum, with the Noether current being the angular momentum density.

3. **[[Time Translation and Energy Conservation|Time Translation]]**: If a system is invariant under translations in time, the associated Noether current is the energy density, leading to the conservation of energy.

### Conclusion

Noether's theorem and the concept of the Noether current highlight the deep interplay between symmetry and conservation laws in physics. They provide a unifying principle that applies across various domains of physics, from classical mechanics to quantum field theory, underscoring the fundamental role of symmetries in the natural world.
