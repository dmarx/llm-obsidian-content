# Process Algebra

[[Process algebra]] (also known as [[process calculus]]) provides a formal framework for describing and analyzing concurrent, distributed systems through algebraic means. It represents a mathematical approach to understanding how components of systems interact, communicate, and evolve over time.

## Formal Definition

A process algebra consists of:
- A set P of [[processes]]
- A set Σ of [[actions]] or [[events]]
- A set of [[operators]] that combine processes
- A set of [[algebraic laws]] governing process behavior

### Core Operators

The fundamental operators typically include:

1. **Sequential Composition** (denoted as ;)
   For processes p, q ∈ P:
   p ; q represents p followed by q

2. **Choice** (denoted as +)
   For processes p, q ∈ P:
   p + q represents nondeterministic choice between p and q

3. **Parallel Composition** (denoted as ||)
   For processes p, q ∈ P:
   p || q represents concurrent execution of p and q

4. **Restriction** (denoted as \)
   For process p ∈ P and action a ∈ Σ:
   p\{a} represents p where action a is hidden/restricted

## Key Process Algebras

### [[CCS]] (Calculus of Communicating Systems)
Developed by [[Robin Milner]], CCS focuses on synchronous communication between processes. Its syntax can be defined recursively:

p ::= 0 | α.p | p + p | p || p | p\L | x | rec x.p

where:
- 0 represents the inactive process
- α represents an atomic action
- x represents a process variable
- rec represents recursion

### [[CSP]] (Communicating Sequential Processes)
Developed by [[Tony Hoare]], CSP emphasizes patterns of communication between processes. It introduces concepts like:
- [[Channel]]-based communication
- [[Deterministic choice]] (□) vs [[Nondeterministic choice]] (⊓)
- [[Alphabetized parallelism]]

### [[π-calculus]]
An extension of CCS that adds the capability to communicate channel names, enabling dynamic network reconfiguration. Its syntax includes:

p ::= 0 | π.p | p + p | p || p | (νx)p | !p

where:
- π represents input/output prefixes
- (νx) represents name restriction
- ! represents replication

## Behavioral Equivalences

Process algebras define various notions of behavioral equivalence:

1. [[Trace Equivalence]] (≡tr)
   Processes are equivalent if they can perform the same sequences of actions

2. [[Bisimulation]] (∼)
   Processes are equivalent if they can simulate each other's behavior step by step

3. [[Testing Equivalence]] (≡te)
   Processes are equivalent if they pass the same tests

Formally, for processes p, q:
p ∼ q ⟺ ∀α∈Σ . (p →α p' ⟹ ∃q' . q →α q' ∧ p' ∼ q')
                ∧ (q →α q' ⟹ ∃p' . p →α p' ∧ p' ∼ q')

## Applications

Process algebras find application in:
- [[Protocol verification]]
- [[Distributed systems]] design
- [[Security protocol]] analysis
- [[Model checking]]
- [[Concurrent program]] verification

## Mathematical Properties

Key properties include:
- [[Compositionality]]: The behavior of a complex system can be understood through the behavior of its components
- [[Congruence]]: Behavioral equivalences are preserved by algebraic operators
- [[Abstraction]]: Internal actions can be hidden to focus on external behavior

## Extended Formalisms

Modern extensions include:
- [[Timed Process Algebra]]
- [[Probabilistic Process Algebra]]
- [[Stochastic Process Algebra]]
- [[Mobile Process Algebra]]

These extensions add capabilities for modeling time, probability, and mobility while maintaining the algebraic foundation of classical process algebra.
