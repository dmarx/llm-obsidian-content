### Underemployment as a Corporate Strategy to Subsidize Worker Salaries with Public Taxes

**Underemployment** can sometimes be used as a corporate strategy where companies hire workers part-time or at low wages, relying on public assistance programs to supplement the workers' income. This approach allows businesses to reduce labor costs while externalizing the burden of providing adequate income to taxpayers. Below, we explore the implications, empirical evidence, and policy recommendations related to this issue.

### Key Issues and Implications

1. **Cost Savings for Corporations:**
   - **Reduced Wage Expenses:** By hiring part-time or low-wage workers, companies can save on wages, benefits, and other labor-related costs.
   - **Flexibility:** This strategy provides companies with greater flexibility in managing labor costs and adjusting workforce size based on demand.

2. **Burden on Public Assistance Programs:**
   - **Increased Public Expenditure:** Workers earning low wages often rely on public assistance programs such as food stamps, Medicaid, and housing subsidies to meet their basic needs.
   - **Taxpayer Subsidies:** These public assistance programs are funded by taxpayers, effectively subsidizing corporate labor costs and shifting the financial burden from employers to the public sector.

3. **Economic and Social Impacts:**
   - **Poverty and Inequality:** Underemployment can contribute to higher levels of poverty and income inequality, as workers are unable to earn sufficient income to achieve financial stability.
   - **Reduced Consumer Spending:** Low wages and underemployment reduce workers' disposable income, which can negatively impact consumer spending and overall economic growth.

### Empirical Evidence

1. **Prevalence of Public Assistance Among Low-Wage Workers:**
   - **UC Berkeley Labor Center Study:** A study by the UC Berkeley Labor Center found that a significant percentage of workers in the fast-food industry rely on public assistance programs. For example, 52% of fast-food workers' families are enrolled in one or more public assistance programs, costing taxpayers approximately $7 billion annually.
   - **Walmart and Public Assistance:** Research has shown that many employees of large retail corporations like Walmart also rely on public assistance, highlighting the extent to which taxpayers subsidize low-wage work.

2. **Cost to Taxpayers:**
   - **Public Assistance Expenditure:** The Economic Policy Institute (EPI) reports that low wages in the retail and fast-food industries cost taxpayers billions of dollars each year in public assistance. For instance, EPI estimated that reliance on public assistance programs by low-wage workers in the retail industry costs taxpayers $13 billion annually.

3. **Corporate Profits vs. Worker Wages:**
   - **Profit Margins:** Many companies employing low-wage workers, particularly in retail and fast food, report substantial profits and high executive compensation. This disparity underscores the potential for these companies to pay higher wages without significantly impacting their financial performance.

### Policy Recommendations

1. **Raising the Minimum Wage:**
   - **Living Wage Standards:** Increasing the minimum wage to a living wage level can ensure that full-time workers earn enough to cover their basic living expenses without needing public assistance.
   - **Indexing to Inflation:** Linking the minimum wage to inflation can prevent future erosion of purchasing power and help maintain workers' financial stability.

2. **Strengthening Labor Standards:**
   - **Fair Scheduling Laws:** Implementing fair scheduling laws can provide workers with more predictable hours and income, reducing the incidence of involuntary part-time employment.
   - **Pro-Rated Benefits:** Requiring employers to provide pro-rated benefits to part-time workers can reduce the reliance on public assistance programs.

3. **Tax and Subsidy Reforms:**
   - **Employer Responsibility Penalties:** Introducing penalties for large employers who have a significant number of employees relying on public assistance can incentivize higher wages and better benefits.
   - **Targeted Tax Credits:** Providing tax credits or subsidies to small businesses that offer living wages and benefits can support these businesses while encouraging fair labor practices.

4. **Expanding Access to Education and Training:**
   - **Skill Development Programs:** Investing in education and training programs can help workers develop the skills needed for higher-paying jobs and reduce underemployment.
   - **Apprenticeships and Internships:** Expanding apprenticeships and internship opportunities can provide workers with on-the-job training and pathways to full-time employment.

5. **Supporting Unionization:**
   - **Collective Bargaining:** Strengthening the rights of workers to unionize and engage in collective bargaining can help improve wages and working conditions in low-wage industries.
   - **Worker Cooperatives:** Promoting the development of worker cooperatives can provide workers with greater control over their wages and working conditions.

### Conclusion

Underemployment as a corporate strategy to subsidize worker salaries with public taxes is a significant issue that places a financial burden on taxpayers and exacerbates economic inequality. Addressing this issue requires comprehensive policy interventions, including raising the minimum wage, strengthening labor standards, reforming tax and subsidy policies, expanding access to education and training, and supporting unionization. By implementing these strategies, policymakers can help ensure that workers receive fair wages and benefits, reducing reliance on public assistance programs and promoting economic stability and growth.
