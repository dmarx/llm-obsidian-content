### Summary and Key Points

1. **Gauge Symmetry**: The Standard Model is a gauge theory based on the symmetry group $SU(3)_C \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$, representing the strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces.
2. **Matter Content**: The matter fields consist of three generations of quarks and leptons, including both left-handed doublets and right-handed singlets.
3. **Electroweak Symmetry Breaking**: The Higgs mechanism spontaneously breaks the $SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$ symmetry down to $U(1)_{\text{em}}$, giving mass to the weak bosons ($W^\pm$, $Z$) and fermions.
4. **Yukawa Interactions**: The Yukawa terms generate fermion masses proportional to the Higgs vacuum expectation value, explaining the mass differences among fermions.

The Standard Model Lagrangian is a comprehensive theory of the known fundamental particles and their interactions, except for gravity. It has been remarkably successful in predicting and explaining experimental results, though it is widely believed to be an incomplete theory, serving as a low-energy effective field theory that will eventually be superseded by a more fundamental framework.

Electroweak Theory


**ASSISTANT**

**Electroweak theory** is the unification of the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces, two of the four fundamental forces of nature, into a single theoretical framework. This unification was developed in the 1960s by [[Sheldon Glashow]], [[Abdus Salam]], and [[Steven Weinberg]], who were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1979 for their work.

### Overview of Electroweak Theory

The electroweak theory is a quantum field theory based on the gauge group $SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$. This group structure reflects the symmetries of the weak force, associated with the $SU(2)_L$ group, and the hypercharge $Y$, associated with the $U(1)_Y$ group. The electromagnetic force and the weak nuclear force emerge as different manifestations of this unified electroweak interaction after spontaneous symmetry breaking.

### Gauge Symmetry and Fields in Electroweak Theory

The electroweak theory introduces four gauge fields:
- **$W^1_\mu$, $W^2_\mu$, $W^3_\mu$**: The gauge fields associated with the $SU(2)_L$ group, which are responsible for the weak interaction.
- **$B_\mu$**: The gauge field associated with the $U(1)_Y$ group, which is related to the hypercharge.

These gauge fields interact with matter fields (fermions) through the covariant derivative, ensuring local gauge invariance under the $SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$ transformations.

### Electroweak Lagrangian

The **electroweak Lagrangian** $\mathcal{L}_{\text{EW}}$ contains several key components:

1. **Gauge Field Kinetic Terms**: Describing the dynamics of the $SU(2)_L$ and $U(1)_Y$ gauge fields.
2. **Fermion Kinetic Terms**: Describing the dynamics of fermions (quarks and leptons) and their interactions with the gauge fields.
3. **Higgs Field Terms**: Describing the dynamics of the Higgs field, which is responsible for breaking the electroweak symmetry.
4. **Yukawa Interactions**: Providing masses to the fermions after the Higgs field acquires a vacuum expectation value (vev).

The electroweak Lagrangian can be written as:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{EW}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{gauge}} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{fermion}} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{Higgs}} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{Yukawa}},
\]

where each component has a specific role in the theory.

#### 1. Gauge Field Kinetic Terms

The kinetic terms for the gauge fields are given by:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{gauge}} = -\frac{1}{4} W^i_{\mu \nu} W^{i \, \mu \nu} - \frac{1}{4} B_{\mu \nu} B^{\mu \nu}.
\]

Here:
- $W^i_{\mu \nu}$ is the field strength tensor for the $SU(2)_L$ gauge fields:

\[
W^i_{\mu \nu} = \partial_\mu W^i_\nu - \partial_\nu W^i_\mu + g \epsilon^{ijk} W^j_\mu W^k_\nu,
\]

where $g$ is the coupling constant of $SU(2)_L$ and $\epsilon^{ijk}$ are the structure constants of the $SU(2)$ group.

- $B_{\mu \nu}$ is the field strength tensor for the $U(1)_Y$ gauge field:

\[
B_{\mu \nu} = \partial_\mu B_\nu - \partial_\nu B_\mu,
\]

where $g'$ is the coupling constant of $U(1)_Y$.

#### 2. Fermion Kinetic Terms

The fermion kinetic terms describe the behavior of the matter fields (quarks and leptons) and their interactions with the gauge fields:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{fermion}} = \sum_{\text{generations}} \left( \overline{L}_L i \gamma^\mu D_\mu L_L + \overline{e}_R i \gamma^\mu D_\mu e_R + \overline{Q}_L i \gamma^\mu D_\mu Q_L + \overline{u}_R i \gamma^\mu D_\mu u_R + \overline{d}_R i \gamma^\mu D_\mu d_R \right).
\]

Here:

- $L_L = \begin{pmatrix} \nu_L \\ e_L \end{pmatrix}$: Left-handed lepton doublet.
- $Q_L = \begin{pmatrix} u_L \\ d_L \end{pmatrix}$: Left-handed quark doublet.
- $e_R$, $u_R$, $d_R$: Right-handed charged lepton, up-type quark, and down-type quark singlets, respectively.

The **covariant derivative** $D_\mu$ introduces interactions with gauge fields:

\[
D_\mu = \partial_\mu + i g \frac{\tau^i}{2} W^i_\mu + i g' \frac{Y}{2} B_\mu,
\]

where $\tau^i$ are the Pauli matrices representing $SU(2)_L$ transformations, and $Y$ is the hypercharge associated with $U(1)_Y$.

#### 3. Higgs Field and Electroweak Symmetry Breaking

The Higgs field $\Phi$ is a complex scalar field in the $SU(2)_L$ doublet representation:

\[
\Phi = \begin{pmatrix} \phi^+ \\ \phi^0 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The Lagrangian for the Higgs field includes both its kinetic term and potential:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{Higgs}} = (D_\mu \Phi)^\dagger (D^\mu \Phi) - V(\Phi),
\]

where:

- The **Higgs potential** $V(\Phi)$ is given by:

\[
V(\Phi) = \mu^2 \Phi^\dagger \Phi + \lambda (\Phi^\dagger \Phi)^2.
\]

If $\mu^2 < 0$, the Higgs field acquires a nonzero vacuum expectation value (vev), breaking the electroweak symmetry $SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$ down to $U(1)_{\text{em}}$:

\[
\langle \Phi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ v \end{pmatrix},
\]

where $v = \sqrt{-\mu^2 / \lambda} \approx 246 \, \text{GeV}$ is the Higgs vev.

#### 4. Yukawa Interactions

Yukawa interactions generate masses for fermions after electroweak symmetry breaking:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{Yukawa}} = - \sum_{i,j} \left( Y^u_{ij} \overline{Q}_{L_i} \tilde{\Phi} u_{R_j} + Y^d_{ij} \overline{Q}_{L_i} \Phi d_{R_j} + Y^e_{ij} \overline{L}_{L_i} \Phi e_{R_j} + \text{h.c.} \right),
\]

where:

- $Y^u_{ij}$, $Y^d_{ij}$, and $Y^e_{ij}$ are the Yukawa matrices for the up-type quarks, down-type quarks, and charged leptons, respectively.
- $\tilde{\Phi} = i \tau_2 \Phi^* = \begin{pmatrix} \phi^{0*} \\ -\phi^- \end{pmatrix}$ is the conjugate Higgs doublet.

### Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking and Mass Generation

When the Higgs field acquires a nonzero vev, the $SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$ symmetry is spontaneously broken to $U(1)_{\text{em}}$. This breaking mechanism explains how particles acquire mass:

- **Gauge Boson Masses**: The gauge bosons of the electroweak theory mix to form the physical $W^\pm$ bosons, $Z$ boson, and the photon $\gamma$:
  - The charged $W^\pm$ bosons gain masses: $M_W = \frac{gv}{2}$.
  - The neutral $Z$ boson gains mass: $M_Z = \frac{v}{2} \sqrt{g^2 + g'^2}$.
  - The photon remains massless.
  
- **Fermion Masses**: The Yukawa interactions provide masses to the fermions proportional to their Yukawa couplings and the Higgs vev:

\[
m_f = \frac{Y_f v}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Weinberg Angle and Electroweak Mixing

The **Weinberg angle** $\theta_W$, also known as the **weak mixing angle**, characterizes the mixing of the $W^3_\mu$ and $B_\mu$ gauge fields to produce the photon
