### **Sampling Agents Relative to a Distribution of Customer Demographics and Segmentations to Simulate an Opinion Poll**

Simulating an **opinion poll** using **Large Language Models (LLMs)** or **agent-based models** requires the careful construction of a **sample population** that represents a realistic distribution of customer demographics and segmentations. By aligning the **sampling agents** with a **demographic distribution**, we can generate responses that are reflective of various population segments. These simulated polls can help explore opinions across different demographic groups, aiding in market research, policy simulations, or product feedback.

This module will walk through the process of simulating an opinion poll by:
1. Defining customer demographics and segmentation.
2. Sampling agents relative to a target distribution.
3. Implementing the polling mechanism using LLMs or rule-based agents.
4. Analyzing and interpreting the simulated results.

### **1. Defining Customer Demographics and Segmentations**

Before simulating an opinion poll, it's crucial to define the demographic factors and segmentations that represent the population of interest. These might include:

#### **Key Demographics**:
- **Age**: Segments like 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, etc.
- **Gender**: Male, Female, Non-binary, Other.
- **Income Levels**: Low income (<$30k), Middle income ($30k-$100k), High income (>$100k).
- **Education**: High school, Bachelor's degree, Master's degree, Doctorate.
- **Geography**: Urban, Suburban, Rural, or based on specific regions/countries.
- **Occupation**: Different professional categories or sectors (e.g., tech, healthcare).

#### **Segmentation**:
Segmentation divides the population based on consumer behavior, preferences, or other characteristics:
- **Loyalty Segments**: High-value customers, new customers, lapsed customers.
- **Behavioral Segments**: Price-sensitive, quality-focused, tech-savvy.
- **Psychographic Segments**: Lifestyle, values, or interests (e.g., environmentally conscious, fitness enthusiasts).

Once the demographic and segmentation characteristics are defined, a target distribution can be established. This might be informed by real-world data (e.g., census data, market research) or estimated based on the objectives of the simulation.

### **2. Sampling Agents from the Distribution**

The goal is to **sample agents** based on the defined demographic and segmentation distribution. Each agent represents an individual in the simulated population and is assigned demographic attributes according to the predefined distribution.

#### **A. Creating the Population Distribution**

The first step is to establish the probability distribution for each demographic factor or segmentation category. For example:

- **Age**:
  - 18-24: 15%
  - 25-34: 25%
  - 35-44: 20%
  - 45-54: 15%
  - 55+: 25%

- **Income**:
  - Low income: 30%
  - Middle income: 50%
  - High income: 20%

You can use a **multinomial distribution** or other probabilistic methods to sample agents with demographic attributes that reflect this population structure.

#### **B. Sampling Demographic Attributes**

For each simulated agent, sample the demographic attributes based on the probability distribution. Using **random sampling** or **weighted random sampling** techniques, you can ensure that each agent is representative of a certain portion of the population.

**Example** (Sampling a single agent):
1. Sample **Age** based on predefined probabilities (e.g., 25% for 25-34).
2. Sample **Gender** (e.g., 50% male, 50% female).
3. Sample **Income** (e.g., 50% middle income).
4. Sample **Education** (e.g., 40% with a Bachelor's degree).
5. Sample **Segment** (e.g., 20% price-sensitive).

Once the demographics for each agent are sampled, they represent a **customer profile** that will participate in the opinion poll.

#### **C. Generating the Full Sample Population**

To generate the full simulated population, repeat the sampling process for each agent, ensuring the sample size is large enough to approximate the underlying demographic distribution. You may adjust the sample size depending on the precision needed for the poll (e.g., 1,000 agents, 10,000 agents).

In Python, this can be done using libraries such as **NumPy** for random sampling:

```python
import numpy as np

# Define probabilities for each demographic attribute
age_probs = [0.15, 0.25, 0.20, 0.15, 0.25]  # For age groups: 18-24, 25-34, etc.
income_probs = [0.30, 0.50, 0.20]           # For income: Low, Middle, High

# Number of agents to sample
n_agents = 1000

# Sampling from distributions
sampled_ages = np.random.choice(['18-24', '25-34', '35-44', '45-54', '55+'], p=age_probs, size=n_agents)
sampled_incomes = np.random.choice(['Low', 'Middle', 'High'], p=income_probs, size=n_agents)

# Create a simulated population
population = [{'age': age, 'income': income} for age, income in zip(sampled_ages, sampled_incomes)]
```

### **3. Polling Mechanism Using LLMs or Rule-Based Agents**

Once you have generated the simulated population of agents, you can use **LLMs** or **rule-based agents** to simulate the polling process. Each agent can be asked the same question or prompt, and the response is generated based on their demographic attributes and segmentation.

#### **A. Using LLMs to Simulate Responses**

An LLM (like GPT-3 or GPT-4) can generate responses based on demographic context. The demographic attributes of each agent can be included as part of the prompt to simulate personalized responses.

**Example Prompt for LLM**:
```text
You are a 25-year-old, middle-income, environmentally conscious customer. 
What is your opinion on electric cars?
```

The LLM will generate a response that aligns with the demographics provided in the prompt.

**Python Example**:
```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load a pre-trained model for text generation (using Hugging Face transformers)
generator = pipeline('text-generation', model='gpt-3')

# Example agent
agent = {
    'age': '25-34',
    'income': 'Middle',
    'segment': 'Environmentally Conscious'
}

# Generate a response based on agent's demographics
prompt = f"You are a {agent['age']} year-old, {agent['income']} income, {agent['segment']} customer. What is your opinion on electric cars?"
response = generator(prompt, max_length=50)
print(response[0]['generated_text'])
```

#### **B. Rule-Based Agent Simulation**

For simpler simulations, you can create **rule-based agents** whose responses are determined by predefined logic based on their demographics or segmentation. For example, if the agent is in the "environmentally conscious" segment, they might be more likely to support electric cars.

**Rule Example**:
```python
def agent_response(agent):
    if agent['segment'] == 'Environmentally Conscious':
        return "I strongly support electric cars because they reduce emissions."
    elif agent['segment'] == 'Price-Sensitive':
        return "Electric cars are too expensive for me to consider right now."
    else:
        return "I'm neutral about electric cars."
```

### **4. Analyzing and Interpreting Simulated Results**

Once the polling responses have been collected, you can analyze the data to gain insights into the overall sentiment or opinion distribution across demographic groups.

#### **A. Aggregating Responses**:
You can aggregate the responses across different demographic groups or segments to simulate the results of an actual opinion poll.

- **Overall Opinion**: Calculate the overall sentiment or opinion distribution.
- **Segmented Opinion**: Break down the opinion based on specific demographics (e.g., age group, income level).
  
**Example Aggregation**:
```python
from collections import Counter

# Collect responses from all agents
responses = [agent_response(agent) for agent in population]

# Count occurrences of each response
response_counts = Counter(responses)

# Display results
for response, count in response_counts.items():
    print(f"{response}: {count} votes")
```

#### **B. Visualizing the Results**:
You can visualize the polling results using **bar charts**, **pie charts**, or other visualization methods to better understand how different demographic groups responded.

**Example**:
- **Bar Plot** of support for electric cars across different income levels.
- **Pie Chart** showing overall opinion distribution (e.g., Support, Neutral, Oppose).

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Example data for visualization
response_counts = {'Support': 500, 'Neutral': 300, 'Oppose': 200}

# Bar plot
plt.bar(response_counts.keys(), response_counts.values())
plt.title('Opinion on Electric Cars')
plt.xlabel('Response')
plt.ylabel('Number of Agents')
plt.show()
```
