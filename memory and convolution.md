title: memory and convolution

**USER**

memory and convolution


**ASSISTANT**

Memory and convolution are intimately related in [[signal processing]], especially in the context of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. Convolution provides a mathematical framework to describe how an LTI system with memory processes an input signal to produce an output signal.

## Memory in LTI Systems

### Definition of Memory

A system has memory if the output at any time depends not only on the current input but also on past inputs. In other words, the system's current state is influenced by its history. This is characteristic of many practical systems, such as filters, where past inputs affect the current output.

### Impulse Response and Memory

For an LTI system, the impulse response \( h(t) \) or \( h[n] \) fully characterizes the system. The impulse response captures how the system responds over time to a single impulse input. This response inherently includes the memory of the system since it describes how past inputs affect future outputs.

## Convolution

### Continuous-Time Convolution

For a continuous-time LTI system with input \( x(t) \) and impulse response \( h(t) \), the output \( y(t) \) is given by the convolution integral:

$$
y(t) = (x * h)(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(\tau) h(t - \tau) \, d\tau
$$

This equation shows that the output \( y(t) \) at time \( t \) is a weighted sum of all past input values \( x(\tau) \), where the weights are given by the impulse response \( h(t - \tau) \).

### Discrete-Time Convolution

For a discrete-time LTI system with input \( x[n] \) and impulse response \( h[n] \), the output \( y[n] \) is given by the convolution sum:

$$
y[n] = (x * h)[n] = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} x[k] h[n - k]
$$

Similarly, this equation shows that the output \( y[n] \) at time \( n \) depends on the weighted sum of all past input values \( x[k] \), with weights provided by the impulse response \( h[n - k] \).

## Relationship Between Memory and Convolution

### System with Memory

Consider an LTI system where the output \( y[n] \) depends on past inputs \( x[n-k] \). The output can be expressed as:

$$
y[n] = \sum_{k=0}^{M-1} h[k] x[n-k]
$$

Here, \( h[k] \) represents the impulse response of the system, which encapsulates the memory of the system. The term \( x[n-k] \) indicates that the current output \( y[n] \) depends on the input values from the present and \( M-1 \) previous time steps, indicating a system with memory.

### Memoryless System

In contrast, a memoryless system would have an output that depends only on the current input value \( x[n] \). For a memoryless system, the relationship is simply:

$$
y[n] = f(x[n])
$$

There is no dependency on past inputs, and hence no convolution is involved in such systems.

## Example: FIR and IIR Filters

### FIR Filter (Finite Memory)

An FIR filter has a finite impulse response, which means its memory is finite. The output of an FIR filter is given by:

$$
y[n] = \sum_{k=0}^{M-1} h[k] x[n-k]
$$

This is a convolution of the input signal \( x[n] \) with the filter's impulse response \( h[k] \), where \( M \) is the filter length, indicating the extent of the memory.

### IIR Filter (Infinite Memory)

An IIR filter has an impulse response that extends indefinitely, indicating infinite memory. The output of an IIR filter is given by:

$$
y[n] = \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} b[k] x[n-k] - \sum_{k=1}^{M-1} a[k] y[n-k]
$$

This equation shows that the current output \( y[n] \) depends on both past inputs \( x[n-k] \) and past outputs \( y[n-k] \), reflecting the infinite memory of the system. The convolution operation here includes feedback from past outputs.

## Mathematical Formalism

### Continuous-Time Convolution Integral

For a continuous-time signal \( x(t) \) and an impulse response \( h(t) \):

$$
y(t) = (x * h)(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(\tau) h(t - \tau) \, d\tau
$$

### Discrete-Time Convolution Sum

For a discrete-time signal \( x[n] \) and an impulse response \( h[n] \):

$$
y[n] = (x * h)[n] = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} x[k] h[n - k]
$$

These convolution operations encapsulate the memory of the system, showing how past values of the input \( x \) influence the current output \( y \).

## Summary

Memory in [[signal processing]] refers to the dependence of a system's output on past inputs. Convolution provides the mathematical operation that describes this relationship in LTI systems. By understanding convolution, we can analyze and design systems with specific memory characteristics, such as FIR and IIR filters, to achieve desired [[signal processing]] objectives. The interplay between memory and convolution is fundamental to many [[signal processing]] applications, including filtering, control systems, and communications.
