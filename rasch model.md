Rasch Model


**ASSISTANT**

The Rasch model, also known as the one-parameter logistic model (1PL), is a foundational approach within [[Item Response Theory|IRT]]. It is named after the Danish mathematician Georg Rasch and is used to analyze and score assessments in various fields, particularly in education and psychology. The Rasch model assumes that the probability of a correct response to an item depends only on the difference between the person’s ability and the item’s difficulty.

## Core Concepts of the Rasch Model

### 1. **Model Specification**

The Rasch model for dichotomous items is defined as follows:
$$
P(X_{ni} = 1 | \theta_n, b_i) = \frac{e^{(\theta_n - b_i)}}{1 + e^{(\theta_n - b_i)}}
$$
where:
- \( P(X_{ni} = 1 | \theta_n, b_i) \) is the probability that person \( n \) answers item \( i \) correctly.
- \( \theta_n \) represents the ability level of person \( n \).
- \( b_i \) represents the difficulty parameter of item \( i \).
- \( X_{ni} \) is the response of person \( n \) to item \( i \) (1 for correct, 0 for incorrect).

### 2. **Assumptions of the Rasch Model**

- **Unidimensionality**: The model assumes that a single latent trait (e.g., ability in mathematics) underlies responses to the items.
- **Local Independence**: Responses to different items are independent given the latent trait.
- **Equal Discrimination**: All items discriminate equally between different levels of the latent trait. This is why the Rasch model is often referred to as the one-parameter model.

### 3. **Item Characteristic Curve (ICC)**

The Item Characteristic Curve (ICC) for the Rasch model is a logistic function that shows the probability of a correct response as a function of the latent trait:
$$
P(X_{ni} = 1 | \theta_n, b_i) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\theta_n - b_i)}}
$$
The curve’s shape is determined solely by the item difficulty parameter \( b_i \).

### 4. **Parameter Estimation**

Estimating the parameters (\(\theta_n\) and \(b_i\)) in the Rasch model typically involves iterative procedures such as:

- **Joint Maximum Likelihood Estimation (JMLE)**: Estimates both person abilities and item difficulties simultaneously, but can be biased if the sample size is small.
- **Conditional Maximum Likelihood Estimation (CMLE)**: Focuses on estimating item parameters first, then uses these estimates to determine person abilities.
- **Marginal Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MMLE)**: Integrates out the distribution of person abilities, often combined with Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithms.

### 5. **Properties of the Rasch Model**

- **Specific Objectivity**: The comparison of two individuals’ abilities is independent of the specific items used, and the comparison of two items’ difficulties is independent of the specific individuals tested.
- **Invariance**: The item parameters are invariant across different samples of individuals, and person parameters are invariant across different sets of items.

### 6. **Applications of the Rasch Model**

#### **Educational Testing**

The Rasch model is widely used in educational testing to develop and analyze assessments such as standardized tests and classroom exams. For instance, the [[National Assessment of Educational Progress|NAEP]] uses the Rasch model to ensure that the test items are comparable over time and across different groups of students.

#### **Psychometrics**

In psychometrics, the Rasch model helps in constructing and validating scales that measure psychological constructs like anxiety, depression, and personality traits. For example, the [[Beck Depression Inventory|BDI]] can be analyzed using the Rasch model to ensure that it measures the same construct consistently across different populations.

#### **Health Outcomes Measurement**

The Rasch model is also used in health outcomes measurement to develop patient-reported outcome measures. Tools like the [[Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System|PROMIS]] use the Rasch model to create scales that accurately assess patient health status.

### Example: Rasch Model in Practice

Consider a math test with five items, and the estimated difficulty parameters for these items are as follows:
- Item 1: \( b_1 = -1.5 \)
- Item 2: \( b_2 = -0.5 \)
- Item 3: \( b_3 = 0.0 \)
- Item 4: \( b_4 = 1.0 \)
- Item 5: \( b_5 = 1.5 \)

If a student has an ability level \(\theta\) of 0.5, the probability of correctly answering each item can be calculated using the Rasch model formula:
$$
P(X_{ni} = 1 | \theta = 0.5, b_i) = \frac{e^{(0.5 - b_i)}}{1 + e^{(0.5 - b_i)}}
$$

For Item 1:
$$
P(X_{n1} = 1 | \theta = 0.5, b_1 = -1.5) = \frac{e^{(0.5 - (-1.5))}}{1 + e^{(0.5 - (-1.5))}} = \frac{e^{2}}{1 + e^{2}} \approx 0.88
$$

For Item 2:
$$
P(X_{n2} = 1 | \theta = 0.5, b_2 = -0.5) = \frac{e^{(0.5 - (-0.5))}}{1 + e^{(0.5 - (-0.5))}} = \frac{e^{1}}{1 + e^{1}} \approx 0.73
$$

For Item 3:
$$
P(X_{n3} = 1 | \theta = 0.5, b_3 = 0.0) = \frac{e^{(0.5 - 0.0)}}{1 + e^{(0.5 - 0.0)}} = \frac{e^{0.5}}{1 + e^{0.5}} \approx 0.62
$$

For Item 4:
$$
P(X_{n4} = 1 | \theta = 0.5, b_4 = 1.0) = \frac{e^{(0.5 - 1.0)}}{1 + e^{(0.5 - 1.0)}} = \frac{e^{-0.5}}{1 + e^{-0.5}} \approx 0.38
$$

For Item 5:
$$
P(X_{n5} = 1 | \theta = 0.5, b_5 = 1.5) = \frac{e^{(0.5 - 1.5)}}{1 + e^{(0.5 - 1.5)}} = \frac{e^{-1.0}}{1 + e^{-1.0}} \approx 0.27
$$

In summary, the Rasch model provides a robust framework for analyzing test data, ensuring that the measurement of abilities or traits is both accurate and fair. Its applications span various fields, from educational testing to health outcomes measurement, making it a versatile tool in psychometric analysis.
