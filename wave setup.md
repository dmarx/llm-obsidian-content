Wave Setup

### Wave Setup

**Wave setup** refers to the increase in mean water level at the shoreline due to the presence of breaking waves. This phenomenon is a direct consequence of the momentum flux associated with waves, which results in a gradient of [[radiation stress]] as the waves move into shallower water and eventually break. Wave setup is crucial in coastal engineering and [[oceanography]] as it influences coastal flooding, beach erosion, and the design of coastal structures.

### Key Concepts

1. **Mechanism of Wave Setup**:
   - **Wave Breaking**: As waves propagate from deeper water towards the shore, they encounter shallower depths, which leads to an increase in wave height and eventually causes the waves to break. When waves break, there is a loss of wave energy due to turbulence and dissipation.
   - **Radiation Stress**: The concept of [[radiation stress]], introduced by Longuet-Higgins and Stewart (1962), is fundamental to understanding wave setup. Radiation stress represents the excess momentum flux in the water column due to the presence of waves. As waves approach the shore and break, the [[radiation stress]] decreases.
   - **Hydrostatic Balance**: The reduction in [[radiation stress]] as waves break results in a force imbalance. To restore hydrostatic balance, the mean water level rises, creating what is known as wave setup.

2. **Wave Setup and Coastal Dynamics**:
   - **Wave Setup vs. Tidal Effects**: Wave setup can significantly increase water levels above the normal tidal level, especially during storms. This can exacerbate coastal flooding and erosion, particularly in low-lying areas.
   - **Shoreline Runup**: Wave setup contributes to the total runup, which is the maximum vertical extent of wave uprush on the shore. Total runup includes both wave setup and the oscillatory motion of waves (wave swash).

3. **Mathematical Formulation**:
   - **Radiation Stress Gradient**: The wave setup \( \zeta \) is related to the gradient of the [[radiation stress]] in the shoreward direction. For a 1D case in the \( x \)-direction (perpendicular to the shoreline), the wave setup is given by:
     $$
     \frac{d\zeta}{dx} = -\frac{1}{\rho g} \frac{dS_{xx}}{dx}
     $$
     where:
     - \( \zeta(x) \) is the wave setup as a function of distance \( x \) from the shore,
     - \( \rho \) is the density of water,
     - \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity,
     - \( S_{xx} \) is the [[radiation stress]] component in the direction of wave propagation.
   - **Depth-Integrated Momentum Balance**: This equation arises from the depth-integrated momentum balance considering the horizontal forces due to both pressure and [[radiation stress]] gradients. It shows that the increase in water level (wave setup) is directly related to the decrease in [[radiation stress]] near the shore.

4. **Factors Influencing Wave Setup**:
   - **Wave Height**: Larger waves typically result in greater wave setup because they generate stronger [[radiation stress]] gradients as they break.
   - **Beach Slope**: The slope of the beach influences how quickly waves break and how much wave energy is dissipated. Steeper slopes tend to produce higher wave setup because waves break closer to the shore.
   - **Wave Period**: Longer period waves (such as swell) tend to produce more significant wave setup than shorter period waves because they carry more energy over a longer wavelength.

### Applications of Wave Setup

1. **Coastal Engineering**:
   - **Design of Coastal Structures**: Understanding wave setup is critical in designing coastal protection structures like seawalls, breakwaters, and revetments. These structures must account for the elevated water levels due to wave setup to prevent overtopping and damage.
   - **Flood Defenses**: Coastal flood defenses need to be designed with wave setup in mind, especially in regions prone to storm surges and high wave energy. Wave setup can significantly raise water levels above predicted tide levels, leading to increased flood risk.

2. **Beach and Dune Erosion**:
   - **Impact on Erosion**: Wave setup contributes to coastal erosion by increasing water levels and enhancing the landward transport of sediment. During storms, wave setup can lead to significant dune erosion and beach profile changes.
   - **Beach Nourishment Projects**: In beach nourishment projects, where sand is added to eroding beaches, wave setup is an important consideration for predicting how the added material will be distributed and how the beach profile will evolve.

3. **Coastal Flood Risk Assessment**:
   - **Storm Surge Models**: In storm surge models, wave setup is an essential component in accurately predicting coastal water levels during extreme weather events. By accounting for wave setup, models can better estimate the extent of coastal flooding and inform emergency response strategies.
   - **Sea-Level Rise Projections**: With rising sea levels due to climate change, the impact of wave setup is expected to become more significant. Accurate predictions of future coastal flooding require consideration of both rising sea levels and increased wave setup due to more frequent and intense storms.

4. **Environmental and Ecological Impacts**:
   - **Impact on Coastal Ecosystems**: Elevated water levels due to wave setup can impact coastal ecosystems, such as salt marshes, mangroves, and coral reefs. These environments are sensitive to changes in water level and can be affected by increased inundation and wave energy.
   - **Sediment Transport and Habitat Formation**: Wave setup influences sediment transport, which plays a role in the formation and maintenance of coastal habitats. Understanding how wave setup affects sediment dynamics is crucial for managing and preserving these ecosystems.

### Field Measurements and Modeling

1. **Field Measurements**:
   - **Wave Gauges and Pressure Sensors**: Wave setup can be measured using wave gauges and pressure sensors placed along the shore. These instruments record changes in water level associated with wave activity, allowing researchers to quantify wave setup.
   - **Lidar and Remote Sensing**: Lidar and other remote sensing techniques are increasingly used to measure wave setup and coastal inundation over large areas. These methods provide high-resolution data on water levels and coastal topography.

2. **Numerical Modeling**:
   - **SWAN (Simulating WAves Nearshore)**: The SWAN model is widely used to simulate wave propagation, transformation, and breaking in coastal areas. It includes the effects of wave setup by solving the [[radiation stress]] gradients and predicting changes in mean water level.
   - **XBeach Model**: XBeach is another numerical model specifically designed for predicting coastal erosion, dune overwash, and coastal flooding during storm events. It incorporates wave setup in its calculations of water levels and sediment transport.

3. **Analytical Approaches**:
   - **Simplified Models**: In some cases, simplified analytical models are used to estimate wave setup for engineering design purposes. These models are based on empirical relationships between wave height, beach slope, and wave setup, and are useful for quick assessments.

### Conclusion

**Wave setup** is a critical phenomenon in coastal dynamics, representing the increase in mean water level due to breaking waves. This process is driven by the gradients in [[radiation stress]] as waves lose energy near the shore. Wave setup has significant implications for coastal engineering, beach erosion, flood risk assessment, and environmental management. Accurate understanding and prediction of wave setup are essential for designing coastal defenses, managing coastal hazards, and protecting coastal ecosystems, particularly in the context of rising sea levels and increasing storm intensity due to climate change.
