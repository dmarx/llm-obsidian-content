Expected Utility Theory


**ASSISTANT**

### Expected Utility Theory

**Expected Utility Theory (EUT)** is a foundational concept in economics and decision theory that models how rational individuals make choices under uncertainty. The theory posits that individuals choose among risky options by comparing their expected utilities, aiming to maximize overall satisfaction or utility.

#### Core Concepts

1. **Utility**: Represents the satisfaction or value derived from a particular outcome. In EUT, utility is often quantified, allowing for comparison between different outcomes.

2. **Probability**: Each potential outcome of a decision has an associated probability, representing the likelihood of that outcome occurring.

3. **Expected Utility**: The sum of the utilities of all possible outcomes, each weighted by its probability. It is calculated as:
   $$ E(U) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i U(x_i) $$
   where \( E(U) \) is the expected utility, \( p_i \) is the probability of outcome \( x_i \), and \( U(x_i) \) is the utility of outcome \( x_i \).

#### Mathematical Formalism

Consider a decision-maker faced with a set of possible outcomes, each associated with a specific probability. The expected utility of a lottery (or gamble) with outcomes \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) and corresponding probabilities \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n \) is given by:

$$ E(U) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i U(x_i) $$

Here, the decision-maker evaluates each outcome \( x_i \) based on its utility \( U(x_i) \) and weighs it by its probability \( p_i \). The choice with the highest expected utility is preferred.

#### Key Assumptions

1. **Completeness**: Individuals can rank all possible outcomes. For any two outcomes \( A \) and \( B \), they can say \( A \) is preferred to \( B \), \( B \) is preferred to \( A \), or they are indifferent.

2. **Transitivity**: Preferences are consistent. If \( A \) is preferred to \( B \) and \( B \) is preferred to \( C \), then \( A \) is preferred to \( C \).

3. **Independence**: If an individual is indifferent between outcomes \( A \) and \( B \), they should remain indifferent if both outcomes are mixed with a third outcome \( C \) with the same probabilities.

4. **Continuity**: If \( A \) is preferred to \( B \) and \( B \) is preferred to \( C \), there exists a probability mix of \( A \) and \( C \) that the individual will find equally desirable as \( B \).

#### Utility Functions

1. **Linear Utility**: Represents risk-neutral preferences. The utility of outcomes increases linearly with their value. For example, \( U(x) = x \).

2. **Concave Utility**: Represents risk-averse preferences. The utility function is concave, reflecting diminishing marginal utility. For instance, \( U(x) = \sqrt{x} \).

3. **Convex Utility**: Represents risk-seeking preferences. The utility function is convex, indicating increasing marginal utility. An example is \( U(x) = x^2 \).

#### Applications

1. **Financial Decision-Making**: EUT is widely used in finance to model investment choices, insurance decisions, and portfolio management. Investors evaluate the expected utility of different portfolios to make optimal investment decisions.

2. **Insurance**: Individuals use EUT to decide whether to purchase insurance by comparing the expected utility of being insured versus uninsured.

3. **Public Policy**: Policymakers apply EUT to evaluate the expected benefits and costs of different policy options, aiming to choose the one that maximizes societal welfare.

#### Critiques and Alternatives

1. **Behavioral Anomalies**: Empirical evidence shows that real-world decisions often deviate from EUT predictions due to cognitive biases and heuristics. Examples include the Allais paradox and the Ellsberg paradox, where individuals' choices violate the independence axiom.

2. **Prospect Theory**: Developed by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, Prospect Theory addresses some limitations of EUT by incorporating psychological insights into decision-making. It accounts for how people perceive gains and losses differently and introduces probability weighting.

3. **Ambiguity Aversion**: EUT assumes known probabilities for all outcomes. However, in many real-world situations, probabilities are ambiguous. Models like the maximin expected utility and smooth ambiguity preferences have been developed to handle such ambiguity.

#### Neuroeconomic Insights

Neuroeconomics investigates the neural underpinnings of decision-making predicted by EUT. Studies have shown that:
- The prefrontal cortex is involved in computing expected utilities and making decisions under uncertainty.
- The ventral striatum encodes reward-related information and contributes to evaluating the expected utility of different choices.
- Functional MRI (fMRI) studies have identified specific brain regions activated when individuals evaluate risky options and calculate expected utilities.

### Expected Utility Theory

**Expected Utility Theory (EUT)** is a fundamental concept in economics and decision theory that provides a framework for understanding how individuals make choices under uncertainty. Developed by John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern in the mid-20th century, EUT posits that people make decisions by considering the expected utility of different options and choosing the one with the highest expected utility.

#### Core Concepts

1. **Utility**: Utility is a measure of the satisfaction or value that an individual derives from a particular outcome. It is a subjective measure, varying from person to person.
   
2. **Expected Utility**: The expected utility of a risky prospect (or lottery) is the weighted average of the utilities of all possible outcomes, with the probabilities of each outcome serving as the weights.

3. **Risk Aversion**: Most individuals exhibit risk aversion, preferring a certain outcome over a gamble with the same expected utility. This is reflected in the concavity of the utility function.

#### Mathematical Formalism

Let \( X \) be a random variable representing a set of possible outcomes, and let \( p(x_i) \) be the probability of outcome \( x_i \). The utility function \( u(x) \) assigns a utility value to each outcome \( x \).

The expected utility \( E[U] \) of the lottery is given by:

$$ E[U] = \sum_{i} p(x_i) u(x_i) $$

where:
- \( x_i \) represents the possible outcomes.
- \( p(x_i) \) is the probability of outcome \( x_i \).
- \( u(x_i) \) is the utility of outcome \( x_i \).

#### Utility Functions and Risk Preferences

1. **Risk-Averse Individuals**: Prefer a certain outcome over a gamble with the same expected value. Their utility function \( u(x) \) is concave (\( u''(x) < 0 \)).

2. **Risk-Neutral Individuals**: Indifferent between certain outcomes and gambles with the same expected value. Their utility function \( u(x) \) is linear (\( u''(x) = 0 \)).

3. **Risk-Seeking Individuals**: Prefer a gamble over a certain outcome with the same expected value. Their utility function \( u(x) \) is convex (\( u''(x) > 0 \)).

#### Example

Consider a simple lottery with two possible outcomes:
- Win $100 with probability 0.5.
- Win $50 with probability 0.5.

Assume a utility function \( u(x) = \sqrt{x} \).

The expected utility is:

$$ E[U] = 0.5 \cdot u(100) + 0.5 \cdot u(50) = 0.5 \cdot \sqrt{100} + 0.5 \cdot \sqrt{50} = 0.5 \cdot 10 + 0.5 \cdot 7.07 \approx 8.54 $$

If the certain amount equivalent to this expected utility is sought, it would be \( u^{-1}(8.54) \approx 72.97 \). Thus, the individual would be indifferent between receiving approximately $72.97 for sure and participating in the lottery.

#### Empirical Findings

1. **Allais Paradox**: Demonstrates that people's choices violate the independence axiom of EUT. It shows that people do not always behave in a manner consistent with maximizing expected utility, suggesting the need for alternative models.

2. **Ellsberg Paradox**: Highlights ambiguity aversion, where people prefer known probabilities over unknown probabilities, even if the expected utility is higher in the ambiguous option.

3. **Prospect Theory**: Developed by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, Prospect Theory modifies EUT by incorporating psychological factors such as loss aversion and reference dependence. It explains many deviations from EUT observed in empirical studies.

#### Practical Applications

1. **Financial Decision-Making**: EUT is used to model investor behavior, portfolio choice, and risk management. It helps in understanding how individuals balance risk and return in their investment decisions.

2. **Insurance**: EUT explains why people buy insurance. The utility loss from a small certain payment (insurance premium) is less than the expected utility loss from a large uncertain loss (potential damage).

3. **Behavioral Economics**: EUT provides a baseline for identifying deviations in real-world decision-making, leading to the development of behavioral models that better predict actual behavior.

4. **Policy Design**: Policymakers use EUT to evaluate the expected benefits and costs of different policy options, helping to design policies that maximize social welfare.

#### Critiques and Limitations

1. **Descriptive Inaccuracy**: Empirical violations like the Allais and Ellsberg paradoxes suggest that EUT does not always accurately describe human behavior.
   
2. **Complexity in Real-World Applications**: Calculating exact probabilities and utilities for real-world decisions can be complex and unrealistic.

3. **Alternative Models**: Models like Prospect Theory and Cumulative Prospect Theory address some of the limitations of EUT by incorporating psychological factors and observed behaviors.

- [[Prospect Theory]]
- [[Behavioral Economics]]
- [[Risk Aversion]]
- [[Decision Theory]]
- [[Portfolio Choice]]
- [[Insurance Economics]]

Understanding Expected Utility Theory provides a foundational framework for analyzing decisions under uncertainty, offering insights into how people make choices and the factors that influence their risk preferences. This knowledge is crucial for applications in finance, economics, policy design, and beyond.

Allais Paradox


**ASSISTANT**

### Allais Paradox

The **Allais Paradox** is a well-known problem in decision theory and behavioral economics, introduced by Maurice Allais in 1953. It demonstrates that individuals' choices violate the expected utility theory (EUT), specifically the independence axiom. This paradox highlights the inconsistency of human behavior with the predictions of EUT and suggests the need for alternative models of decision-making under risk.

#### The Independence Axiom

The independence axiom of EUT states that if an individual prefers option \( A \) over option \( B \), they should also prefer a lottery that offers \( A \) with some probability \( p \) and another outcome \( C \) with probability \( 1-p \) over a similar lottery that offers \( B \) with probability \( p \) and \( C \) with probability \( 1-p \).

Mathematically, if \( A \succ B \), then for any outcome \( C \) and any probability \( p \),
$$ pA + (1-p)C \succ pB + (1-p)C $$

#### The Paradox

The Allais Paradox presents two sets of choices to illustrate a violation of the independence axiom.

##### Scenario 1

1. **Choice 1A**: Receive $1 million for sure.
2. **Choice 1B**: 10% chance to receive $5 million, 89% chance to receive $1 million, and 1% chance to receive nothing.

##### Scenario 2

1. **Choice 2A**: 11% chance to receive $1 million, and 89% chance to receive nothing.
2. **Choice 2B**: 10% chance to receive $5 million, and 90% chance to receive nothing.

#### Common Responses

1. **Choice 1**: Many people prefer 1A (the certain $1 million) over 1B (the lottery with 10% chance of $5 million).
2. **Choice 2**: Many people prefer 2B (the lottery with 10% chance of $5 million) over 2A (the lottery with 11% chance of $1 million).

#### Analysis

According to EUT, the choices should be consistent. If an individual prefers 1A over 1B, they should also prefer 2A over 2B. Let's calculate the expected utilities:

Let \( u(x) \) be the utility function.

For Scenario 1:
- **Choice 1A**: \( U(1A) = u(1,000,000) \)
- **Choice 1B**: \( U(1B) = 0.1u(5,000,000) + 0.89u(1,000,000) + 0.01u(0) \)

For Scenario 2:
- **Choice 2A**: \( U(2A) = 0.11u(1,000,000) + 0.89u(0) \)
- **Choice 2B**: \( U(2B) = 0.1u(5,000,000) + 0.9u(0) \)

If \( u(1,000,000) \succ 0.1u(5,000,000) + 0.89u(1,000,000) + 0.01u(0) \), then by the independence axiom:
$$ 0.11u(1,000,000) + 0.89u(0) \succ 0.1u(5,000,000) + 0.9u(0) $$

However, many people prefer 2B over 2A, contradicting the independence axiom.

#### Implications

The Allais Paradox indicates that individuals' preferences are influenced by the certainty effect, where people overweight outcomes that are certain compared to those that are merely probable. This behavior suggests that individuals do not always adhere to the rational choice postulates of EUT.

#### Alternative Models

1. **Prospect Theory**: Developed by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, this theory accounts for observed behaviors like the certainty effect and loss aversion. It modifies EUT by introducing a value function that is concave for gains and convex for losses, and a probability weighting function that overweights small probabilities and underweights large probabilities.

   The value function \( v(x) \) replaces the utility function, and the probability weighting function \( \pi(p) \) adjusts the probabilities:

   $$ PT = \sum \pi(p_i)v(x_i) $$

2. **Rank-Dependent Utility Theory**: This model also modifies EUT by incorporating probability weighting but maintains the utility function's structure. It proposes that individuals transform probabilities in a way that reflects their subjective perception of risk.

#### Practical Applications

1. **Policy Design**: Understanding that individuals violate EUT helps in designing policies that align better with actual human behavior. For example, presenting choices in a way that accounts for the certainty effect can improve decision-making in areas like health insurance and retirement planning.

2. **Behavioral Finance**: Insights from the Allais Paradox and alternative models inform strategies to help investors make better decisions by recognizing and mitigating cognitive biases.

3. **Marketing and Consumer Behavior**: Marketers can design offers and promotions that leverage the certainty effect, enhancing the appeal of certain discounts or guarantees.

The Allais Paradox underscores the limitations of Expected Utility Theory in describing real-world decision-making, highlighting the importance of incorporating psychological factors into economic models to better predict and understand human behavior.

Expected Utility Theory


**ASSISTANT**

Expected Utility Theory (EUT) is a fundamental concept in decision theory and economics that provides a framework for making rational choices under conditions of uncertainty. It was first developed by John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern in their 1944 book "Theory of Games and Economic Behavior." The theory posits that individuals choose between risky or uncertain prospects by comparing their expected utilities and selecting the option with the highest expected utility.

## Core Concepts of Expected Utility Theory

### 1. Utility
Utility is a measure of the satisfaction or value that an individual derives from a particular outcome. It provides a way to quantify preferences over different outcomes.

### 2. Expected Utility
Expected utility is the sum of the utilities of all possible outcomes, each weighted by the probability of that outcome occurring. For a decision-maker facing a set of possible outcomes, the expected utility \(E(U)\) of an action is calculated as:

$$
E(U) = \sum_{i} p_i \cdot u(x_i)
$$

where:
- \( p_i \) is the probability of outcome \( x_i \),
- \( u(x_i) \) is the utility of outcome \( x_i \).

### 3. Rational Choice
According to EUT, a rational decision-maker will choose the action that maximizes their expected utility.

### 4. Risk Aversion, Risk Neutrality, and Risk Seeking
- **Risk-Averse**: Prefers a certain outcome over a gamble with higher or equal expected utility. The utility function is concave (e.g., \( u(x) = \sqrt{x} \)).
- **Risk-Neutral**: Indifferent between a certain outcome and a gamble with the same expected utility. The utility function is linear (e.g., \( u(x) = x \)).
- **Risk-Seeking**: Prefers a gamble over a certain outcome with lower or equal expected utility. The utility function is convex (e.g., \( u(x) = x^2 \)).

## Example of Expected Utility Calculation

Consider a scenario where an investor must choose between two investment options:

### Investment A
- 50% chance of gaining $1000
- 50% chance of gaining $500

### Investment B
- 100% chance of gaining $700

First, let's define a utility function. Assume the investor is risk-averse with a utility function \( u(x) = \sqrt{x} \).

### Calculating Expected Utility for Investment A
- The utility of gaining $1000 is \( u(1000) = \sqrt{1000} = 31.62 \)
- The utility of gaining $500 is \( u(500) = \sqrt{500} = 22.36 \)

The expected utility of Investment A is:
$$
E(U_A) = 0.5 \cdot u(1000) + 0.5 \cdot u(500) = 0.5 \cdot 31.62 + 0.5 \cdot 22.36 = 26.99
$$

### Calculating Expected Utility for Investment B
- The utility of gaining $700 is \( u(700) = \sqrt{700} = 26.46 \)

The expected utility of Investment B is:
$$
E(U_B) = u(700) = 26.46
$$

### Decision
Since \( E(U_A) = 26.99 \) is greater than \( E(U_B) = 26.46 \), the investor should choose Investment A according to EUT, as it provides a higher expected utility.

## Implications and Applications

### Economics and Finance
EUT is widely used in economics and finance to model consumer behavior, investment decisions, and insurance. It helps in understanding how individuals make choices under risk and uncertainty.

### Insurance
Risk-averse individuals are willing to pay a premium to avoid uncertainty. EUT explains why people buy insurance even when the expected monetary value of the insurance is less than the premium paid.

### Portfolio Theory
EUT underpins modern portfolio theory, where investors choose portfolios to maximize expected utility based on their risk preferences.

### Public Policy and Welfare Economics
EUT guides policy-making by evaluating the expected utility of different policy options, helping to maximize social welfare.

### Criticisms and Limitations

### 1. Descriptive Accuracy
EUT assumes rational behavior, but real-world decisions often deviate due to cognitive biases and heuristics. Descriptive decision theories like Prospect Theory address these deviations.

### 2. Utility Measurement
Quantifying utility and accurately assigning probabilities to outcomes can be challenging. People may not have well-defined utility functions or consistent risk preferences.

### 3. Independence Axiom
EUT relies on the independence axiom, which states that if a decision-maker is indifferent between two lotteries, they should remain indifferent if these lotteries are mixed with a third lottery. In practice, this axiom is often violated.

### 4. Non-expected Utility Theories
Alternatives to EUT, such as Prospect Theory, Rank-Dependent Utility Theory, and Cumulative Prospect Theory, have been developed to better capture observed behaviors that deviate from EUT predictions.

## Example: Medical Decision-Making

Consider a patient deciding between two treatment options for a serious illness:

### Treatment A
- 70% chance of full recovery (utility = 100)
- 30% chance of partial recovery (utility = 50)

### Treatment B
- 100% chance of moderate improvement (utility = 75)

Assuming the patient’s utilities for outcomes are linear (i.e., \( u(x) = x \)):

### Calculating Expected Utility for Treatment A
$$
E(U_A) = 0.7 \cdot 100 + 0.3 \cdot 50 = 70 + 15 = 85
$$

### Calculating Expected Utility for Treatment B
$$
E(U_B) = 1.0 \cdot 75 = 75
$$

### Decision
Since \( E(U_A) = 85 \) is greater than \( E(U_B) = 75 \), the patient should choose Treatment A according to EUT.

In summary, Expected Utility Theory provides a robust framework for rational [[decision-making under uncertainty]] by maximizing expected utility. While it has its limitations and faces criticisms, it remains a foundational concept in economics, finance, and decision theory, guiding choices in various uncertain scenarios.
