The Haldane prior, named after the British geneticist J.B.S. Haldane, is a specific type of improper prior used in Bayesian statistics. It is particularly useful in cases involving binomial or multinomial data where the likelihood function is proportional to a probability raised to a power.

## Definition and Properties

For a binomial distribution, consider a model with a parameter $\theta$ representing the probability of success in a Bernoulli trial. The likelihood function for observing $x$ successes in $n$ trials is given by:

$$
L(\theta \mid x, n) = \theta^x (1 - \theta)^{n-x}
$$

The Haldane prior for $\theta$ is defined as:

$$
\pi(\theta) \propto \frac{1}{\theta(1 - \theta)}
$$

This prior is improper because it does not integrate to a finite value over the interval $[0,1]$. Specifically:

$$
\int_0^1 \frac{1}{\theta(1 - \theta)} \, d\theta = \infty
$$

### Application and Interpretation

The Haldane prior is often used in Bayesian inference for the binomial proportion because it reflects a state of ignorance about $\theta$, giving equal weight to all possible values of $\theta$ except at the boundaries where it is undefined.

#### Posterior Distribution

When the Haldane prior is combined with the binomial likelihood, the resulting posterior distribution is a Beta distribution with parameters depending on the observed data. Specifically, if the prior is $\pi(\theta) \propto \frac{1}{\theta(1 - \theta)}$ and the likelihood is $\theta^x (1 - \theta)^{n-x}$, then the posterior is:

$$
\pi(\theta \mid x, n) \propto \theta^{x-1} (1 - \theta)^{(n-x)-1}
$$

This is a Beta distribution with parameters $\alpha = x$ and $\beta = n - x$:

$$
\pi(\theta \mid x, n) = \text{Beta}(\theta; x, n-x)
$$

### Implications

- **Non-Informative Prior**: The Haldane prior is considered non-informative because it does not favor any particular value of $\theta$. It is useful in situations where little prior information is available.
- **Edge Cases**: The prior has issues at the boundaries ($\theta = 0$ and $\theta = 1$), making it inappropriate when no successes or failures are observed (i.e., $x = 0$ or $x = n$). In such cases, the posterior would be undefined.

### Comparison with Other Priors

- **Jeffreys Prior**: Another commonly used non-informative prior for the binomial proportion is the [[Jeffreys prior]], defined as $\pi(\theta) \propto \theta^{-1/2} (1 - \theta)^{-1/2}$. Unlike the Haldane prior, the Jeffreys prior is proper and leads to a Beta distribution with parameters $\alpha = \frac{1}{2}$ and $\beta = \frac{1}{2}$.
- **Uniform Prior**: The uniform prior, $\pi(\theta) = 1$, is also used in similar contexts but does not have the same properties as the Haldane or Jeffreys priors.

### Mathematical Formalization

For a binomial experiment with a Haldane prior, the posterior distribution can be derived as follows:

Given the likelihood:

$$
L(\theta \mid x, n) = \theta^x (1 - \theta)^{n-x}
$$

and the Haldane prior:

$$
\pi(\theta) \propto \frac{1}{\theta(1 - \theta)}
$$

The posterior is proportional to:

$$
\pi(\theta \mid x, n) \propto \theta^x (1 - \theta)^{n-x} \cdot \frac{1}{\theta(1 - \theta)} = \theta^{x-1} (1 - \theta)^{(n-x)-1}
$$

which is a Beta distribution:

$$
\pi(\theta \mid x, n) = \text{Beta}(\theta; x, n-x)
$$

## Conclusion

The Haldane prior is a useful tool in Bayesian analysis of binomial data when prior information is limited or non-existent. However, its improper nature and boundary issues necessitate careful consideration, especially in cases with extreme observations.
