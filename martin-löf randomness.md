### Martin-Löf Randomness

**Martin-Löf randomness** is a rigorous mathematical definition of randomness for infinite binary sequences, developed by Per Martin-Löf in the 1960s. It provides a formal framework that captures the intuitive idea of a sequence being random as "lacking any effectively detectable patterns." The definition is grounded in [[Algorithmic Information Theory]] and uses concepts from [[Computability Theory]] and measure theory.

---

### Core Idea

An infinite binary sequence \( S = s_1s_2s_3\ldots \) (where \( s_i \in \{0, 1\} \)) is considered **Martin-Löf random** if it cannot be "singled out" by any computable method as being non-random. This is formalized by requiring that \( S \) avoids all **effectively null sets**, which are sequences that fail certain computable statistical tests of randomness.

---

### Definition

#### 1. **Effectively Null Sets**
An effectively null set is a subset of infinite binary sequences with measure zero that can be constructed via a **Martin-Löf test**. A Martin-Löf test is a sequence of uniformly computable open sets \( \{U_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \) such that:

- \( U_n \) has measure at most \( 2^{-n} \):
  $$
  \mu(U_n) \leq 2^{-n},
  $$
  where \( \mu \) is the standard Lebesgue measure on the space of infinite binary sequences.

- The sets \( U_n \) are effectively enumerable (computable from finite descriptions).

A sequence \( S \) is **captured** by a Martin-Löf test if \( S \in \bigcap_{n=1}^\infty U_n \), meaning \( S \) belongs to every level of the test and is therefore in the null set.

#### 2. **Martin-Löf Randomness**
A sequence \( S \) is **Martin-Löf random** if it does not belong to any effectively null set, i.e., if it passes all possible Martin-Löf tests.

### Alternative Characterizations

1. **Incompressibility**
   A sequence \( S \) is Martin-Löf random if and only if the prefix complexity of \( S \), denoted \( K_{\text{prefix}}(S \upharpoonright n) \), satisfies:
   $$
   K_{\text{prefix}}(S \upharpoonright n) \geq n - c,
   $$
   for all \( n \), where \( S \upharpoonright n \) is the first \( n \) bits of \( S \), and \( c \) is a constant independent of \( n \). Intuitively, the prefixes of \( S \) cannot be significantly compressed.

2. **Solovay Tests**
   Martin-Löf randomness can also be characterized using Solovay tests, which generalize Martin-Löf tests with slightly weaker conditions.

3. **Gács' Theorem**
   Gács' theorem connects Martin-Löf randomness to uniform tests, showing that a sequence is random if it avoids failure on every test with uniformly computable measure bounds.

---

### Examples

1. **Random Sequences**
   A sequence \( S = 101100\ldots \), generated by flipping a fair coin, is Martin-Löf random with probability 1. Most sequences (in terms of Lebesgue measure) are random in this sense.

2. **Non-Random Sequences**
   - **Periodic Sequences**: \( S = 1010101010\ldots \) fails basic statistical tests because it exhibits clear periodic patterns.
   - **Constructible Sequences**: \( S = 000000\ldots \) is not random as it is fully determined by a simple algorithm.

3. **Chaitin's Omega**
   Chaitin’s \( \Omega \), the halting probability of a universal Turing machine, is an example of a Martin-Löf random sequence.

---

### Key Properties

1. **Measure-Theoretic Prevalence**
   The set of Martin-Löf random sequences has full measure in the space of infinite binary sequences. This means that "almost every" sequence is random in the sense of Martin-Löf randomness.

2. **Kolmogorov Complexity Connection**
   A sequence \( S \) is Martin-Löf random if and only if its prefixes are incompressible as described above.

3. **Universality of Tests**
   Martin-Löf tests are universal in the sense that any "reasonable" definition of randomness (e.g., based on effective null sets) can be reduced to them.

4. **Robustness**
   Martin-Löf randomness is robust under computable transformations. For example, if \( S \) is Martin-Löf random and \( T \) is obtained from \( S \) via a computable bijection, \( T \) is also Martin-Löf random.

---

### Applications

1. **Foundations of Probability**
   Martin-Löf randomness provides a rigorous basis for interpreting probability in terms of individual sequences rather than ensembles.

2. **Algorithmic Information Theory**
   It formalizes randomness using incompressibility and connects it to [[Kolmogorov Complexity]].

3. **Computable Analysis**
   Randomness tests are used to study properties of functions and measures in computable frameworks.

4. **Quantum Information**
   Extensions of Martin-Löf randomness have been explored for defining randomness in quantum states.

---

### Limitations and Extensions

1. **Dependence on Effective Methods**
   Martin-Löf randomness only considers computable tests; it does not address randomness relative to higher levels of the [[Arithmetical Hierarchy]] or non-computable methods.

2. **Finite Sequences**
   While Martin-Löf randomness applies to infinite sequences, extensions to finite sequences often rely on related notions like Kolmogorov complexity.

3. **Resource-Bounded Randomness**
   Extensions like time-bounded randomness incorporate computational resource constraints into the framework.

4. **Higher-Order Randomness**
   Concepts like Schnorr randomness or \( n \)-randomness refine Martin-Löf randomness by considering alternative test classes.

Martin-Löf randomness stands as the gold standard for defining and understanding algorithmic randomness, combining the rigor of measure theory with the precision of computability theory.
