Field potential


**ASSISTANT**

*[[Field Potential]]*, often referred to as *potential field* or simply *potential*, is a scalar quantity associated with a field that determines the potential energy of a particle at any given point within that field. It is a crucial concept in physics, especially in the study of gravitational, electric, and magnetic fields.

### Definition

The potential \(\phi\) at a point in space is defined such that the force \(\mathbf{F}\) acting on a particle at that point is the negative gradient of the potential:
$$
\mathbf{F} = -\nabla \phi
$$

### Gravitational Potential

The gravitational potential \(\phi_g\) at a distance \(r\) from a point mass \(M\) is given by:
$$
\phi_g = -\frac{GM}{r}
$$
where \(G\) is the gravitational constant. The gravitational potential energy \(U_g\) of a mass \(m\) at this point is:
$$
U_g = m\phi_g = -\frac{GMm}{r}
$$

### Electric Potential

The electric potential \(\phi_e\) at a distance \(r\) from a point charge \(Q\) is given by:
$$
\phi_e = \frac{k_e Q}{r}
$$
where \(k_e\) is Coulomb's constant. The electric potential energy \(U_e\) of a charge \(q\) at this point is:
$$
U_e = q\phi_e = \frac{k_e Qq}{r}
$$

### Potential and Potential Energy

While potential (\(\phi\)) is a scalar field that depends on the position in space, potential energy (\(U\)) is the energy associated with a particle in that field. For a given potential \(\phi\) and a particle with property (mass \(m\) or charge \(q\)):
$$
U = \phi \times \text{property}
$$

### Gradient of Potential

The relationship between the potential field and the force field can be understood through the gradient operation. For a scalar potential \(\phi\), the force \(\mathbf{F}\) is obtained by taking the negative gradient:
$$
\mathbf{F} = -\nabla \phi = -\left( \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x} \hat{i} + \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial y} \hat{j} + \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial z} \hat{k} \right)
$$

### Laplace's Equation

In regions where there are no charges or masses (source-free regions), the potential \(\phi\) satisfies Laplace's equation:
$$
\nabla^2 \phi = 0
$$
This is a second-order partial differential equation used to solve for the potential in electrostatics and gravitation.

### Examples

1. **Gravitational Potential of the Earth**:
   Near the Earth's surface, the gravitational potential \(\phi_g\) due to Earth can be approximated as:
   $$
   \phi_g \approx -gh
   $$
   where \(h\) is the height above the reference level (usually Earth's surface) and \(g\) is the acceleration due to gravity.

2. **Electric Potential of a Uniformly Charged Sphere**:
   For a sphere of radius \(R\) with a uniform charge \(Q\), the electric potential outside the sphere (\(r \geq R\)) is:
   $$
   \phi_e = \frac{k_e Q}{r}
   $$
   Inside the sphere (\(r < R\)), the potential varies linearly with \(r\):
   $$
   \phi_e = \frac{k_e Q}{2R} \left( 3 - \frac{r^2}{R^2} \right)
   $$

### Potential Energy in a Conservative Field

The work done by a conservative force as an object moves from point \(\mathbf{r}_1\) to point \(\mathbf{r}_2\) can be expressed in terms of the potential:
$$
W = -\Delta U = - (U(\mathbf{r}_2) - U(\mathbf{r}_1)) = U(\mathbf{r}_1) - U(\mathbf{r}_2)
$$
For gravitational and electric fields, this is:
$$
W = m \phi_g(\mathbf{r}_1) - m \phi_g(\mathbf{r}_2)
$$
$$
W = q \phi_e(\mathbf{r}_1) - q \phi_e(\mathbf{r}_2)
$$

### Conclusion

Field potential is a central concept in understanding the behavior of particles in a force field. It provides a scalar quantity that simplifies the computation of forces and potential energies in gravitational, electric, and other conservative fields.
