Rayleigh-Jeans Law


**ASSISTANT**

The **Rayleigh-Jeans Law** is a classical approximation of the spectral energy density of electromagnetic radiation emitted by a blackbody at thermal equilibrium. It describes the energy distribution at long wavelengths (or low frequencies) and is derived using classical physics. However, it fails at short wavelengths (high frequencies), where it leads to the so-called **ultraviolet catastrophe**.

### Mathematical Formulation

The **Rayleigh-Jeans law** expresses the spectral energy density $u(\nu, T)$ as a function of frequency $\nu$ for a blackbody at temperature $T$:

$$ u(\nu, T) = \frac{8\pi \nu^2 k_B T}{c^3} $$

where:
- $\nu$ is the frequency of the radiation,
- $T$ is the temperature of the blackbody,
- $k_B$ is the [[Boltzmann constant]],
- $c$ is the speed of light.

Alternatively, the law can be written in terms of wavelength $\lambda$ as:

$$ u(\lambda, T) = \frac{8 \pi k_B T}{\lambda^4} $$

where $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the radiation.

### Derivation of the Rayleigh-Jeans Law

The Rayleigh-Jeans law is derived by considering a blackbody cavity (a perfect absorber and emitter of radiation) with electromagnetic radiation treated as standing waves inside the cavity. The derivation proceeds through the following key steps:

1. **Density of Modes**: The number of allowed electromagnetic wave modes in a cavity with volume $V$ between frequencies $\nu$ and $\nu + d\nu$ is proportional to $\nu^2$ (the **density of states** for electromagnetic waves in three dimensions). This gives:
   $$ g(\nu) d\nu = \frac{8 \pi V \nu^2}{c^3} d\nu $$

2. **Equipartition Theorem**: According to classical statistical mechanics, each mode of the electromagnetic field has an average energy $E = k_B T$, where $T$ is the temperature of the blackbody and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. This is a result of the **equipartition theorem**, which states that each degree of freedom contributes $k_B T$ of energy to the system.

3. **Spectral Energy Density**: The energy density per unit volume is obtained by multiplying the number of modes per unit frequency $g(\nu)$ by the average energy per mode $k_B T$ and dividing by the volume $V$:
   $$ u(\nu, T) = \frac{8 \pi \nu^2 k_B T}{c^3} $$

This is the Rayleigh-Jeans formula for the spectral energy density.

### Failure of the Rayleigh-Jeans Law: Ultraviolet Catastrophe

The **Rayleigh-Jeans law** accurately describes the blackbody radiation spectrum at **low frequencies** (or long wavelengths). However, at **high frequencies**, the law predicts that the energy density increases without bound as $\nu^2$. This leads to the **ultraviolet catastrophe**, a divergence in the total radiated energy at short wavelengths, implying that an infinite amount of energy would be radiated by a blackbody, which contradicts experimental results.

Mathematically, the total energy radiated is obtained by integrating the Rayleigh-Jeans law over all frequencies:

$$ U(T) = \int_0^\infty u(\nu, T) \, d\nu = \int_0^\infty \frac{8 \pi \nu^2 k_B T}{c^3} \, d\nu $$

This integral diverges, indicating that the total energy becomes infinite, which is clearly unphysical.

### Resolution by Planck's Law

The failure of the Rayleigh-Jeans law at high frequencies led to the development of **quantum theory**. In 1900, Max Planck resolved this issue by introducing the concept of **quantized energy levels** for electromagnetic radiation. Planck's formula for blackbody radiation, now known as **Planck's law**, correctly describes the energy distribution over all frequencies and reduces to the Rayleigh-Jeans law at low frequencies.

Planck’s law is given by:

$$ u(\nu, T) = \frac{8\pi h \nu^3}{c^3} \frac{1}{e^{\frac{h\nu}{k_B T}} - 1} $$

At low frequencies ($h\nu \ll k_B T$), Planck's law reduces to the Rayleigh-Jeans law, since:

$$ e^{\frac{h\nu}{k_B T}} - 1 \approx \frac{h\nu}{k_B T} \quad \text{for small } \nu $$

At high frequencies ($h\nu \gg k_B T$), Planck’s law predicts a rapid exponential decay, preventing the ultraviolet catastrophe.

### Applicability of the Rayleigh-Jeans Law

The Rayleigh-Jeans law is valid in the **classical limit**, where the frequency $\nu$ is small enough that the photon energy $h\nu$ is much less than the thermal energy $k_B T$. This typically occurs in the long-wavelength regime, such as for thermal radiation in the microwave or infrared regions.

- **Low-frequency limit**: For $\nu \ll k_B T / h$, the Rayleigh-Jeans law provides a good approximation.
- **High-frequency limit**: For $\nu \gg k_B T / h$, the Rayleigh-Jeans law breaks down and must be replaced by Planck's law.

### Summary

- The **Rayleigh-Jeans law** is a classical description of the spectral energy density of blackbody radiation at low frequencies.
- It predicts that the spectral energy density is proportional to $\nu^2$, leading to an infinite total energy at high frequencies (the **ultraviolet catastrophe**).
- The Rayleigh-Jeans law is accurate for long wavelengths (low frequencies) but fails at short wavelengths (high frequencies), where it is replaced by **Planck’s law**, which incorporates quantum effects.
