# Wavelet Approximation

## Definition

Wavelet approximation involves representing a function using wavelets, which are localized basis functions. Wavelets are effective for analyzing functions with localized features, such as edges or discontinuities, and are widely used in signal processing, image compression, and numerical analysis.

## Key Concepts

### Wavelets

Wavelets are functions that are localized in both time (or space) and frequency. A family of wavelets is generated from a mother wavelet \( \psi(t) \) by translation and scaling:

$$
\psi_{a,b}(t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}} \psi\left(\frac{t - b}{a}\right)
$$

where:
- \( a \) is the scaling parameter (dilation).
- \( b \) is the translation parameter (shift).

### Wavelet Transform

The wavelet transform decomposes a function into wavelets at different scales and positions. There are two main types of wavelet transforms:

1. **Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT)**: Represents a function \( f(t) \) as an integral over all scales and translations of the mother wavelet:

   $$
   W_f(a, b) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t) \psi_{a,b}(t) \, dt
   $$

2. **Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)**: Uses discrete values of scale and translation to represent the function, typically in a dyadic grid (scales and translations are powers of two):

   $$
   \psi_{j,k}(t) = 2^{j/2} \psi(2^j t - k)
   $$

### Wavelet Series Expansion

A function \( f(t) \) can be approximated using a series of wavelets:

$$
f(t) \approx \sum_{j=-\infty}^{\infty} \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} c_{j,k} \psi_{j,k}(t)
$$

where \( c_{j,k} \) are the wavelet coefficients:

$$
c_{j,k} = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t) \psi_{j,k}(t) \, dt
$$

### Multiresolution Analysis

Multiresolution analysis (MRA) provides a framework for constructing wavelets and understanding their properties. In MRA, a function space \( V_j \) is associated with each scale \( j \), and the spaces are nested:

$$
\cdots \subset V_{-1} \subset V_0 \subset V_1 \subset \cdots
$$

Wavelets are constructed to capture the differences between these spaces.

### Haar Wavelets

Haar wavelets are the simplest wavelets, defined as:

$$
\psi(t) = \begin{cases}
1, & 0 \leq t < \frac{1}{2} \\
-1, & \frac{1}{2} \leq t < 1 \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

Haar wavelets are useful for their simplicity and ability to capture abrupt changes in the function.

### Daubechies Wavelets

Daubechies wavelets, named after Ingrid Daubechies, are more complex and provide better localization in both time and frequency. They are defined by a set of scaling and wavelet coefficients.

## Wavelet Decomposition and Reconstruction

### Decomposition

Wavelet decomposition involves breaking down a signal into approximations (low-frequency components) and details (high-frequency components) at various scales. This is achieved using filters:

1. **Low-Pass Filter**: Extracts the approximations.
2. **High-Pass Filter**: Extracts the details.

### Reconstruction

Wavelet reconstruction involves recombining the approximations and details to reconstruct the original signal. This process uses the inverse of the decomposition filters.

## Applications

### Signal Processing

In signal processing, wavelet transforms are used for noise reduction, compression, and feature extraction. Wavelet-based methods can efficiently represent signals with localized features.

### Image Compression

Wavelet transforms are used in image compression standards such as JPEG 2000. They provide high compression ratios while preserving important features like edges.

### Numerical Analysis

Wavelet methods are applied to solve differential equations and integral equations, particularly for problems with localized features or singularities.

### Time-Frequency Analysis

Wavelet transforms provide a time-frequency representation of signals, allowing for the analysis of non-stationary signals whose frequency content changes over time.

## Example: Haar Wavelet Transform

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Original Signal**: Consider a discrete signal \( f = [f_0, f_1, f_2, f_3] \).

2. **Decomposition**: Apply the Haar wavelet transform to decompose the signal into approximations and details.

   - Compute the averages and differences:
     - Averages: \( a_0 = \frac{f_0 + f_1}{2} \), \( a_1 = \frac{f_2 + f_3}{2} \)
     - Differences: \( d_0 = \frac{f_0 - f_1}{2} \), \( d_1 = \frac{f_2 - f_3}{2} \)

3. **Result**: The transformed signal consists of the averages and differences: \( [a_0, a_1, d_0, d_1] \).

4. **Reconstruction**: Reconstruct the original signal from the transformed signal by reversing the decomposition process.

### Pseudocode

```python
import numpy as np

# Original signal
f = np.array([f_0, f_1, f_2, f_3])

# Haar wavelet transform
a_0 = (f[0] + f[1]) / 2
a_1 = (f[2] + f[3]) / 2
d_0 = (f[0] - f[1]) / 2
d_1 = (f[2] - f[3]) / 2

# Transformed signal
transformed_signal = np.array([a_0, a_1, d_0, d_1])

# Reconstruction
f_reconstructed = np.zeros(4)
f_reconstructed[0] = a_0 + d_0
f_reconstructed[1] = a_0 - d_0
f_reconstructed[2] = a_1 + d_1
f_reconstructed[3] = a_1 - d_1

print("Original Signal:", f)
print("Transformed Signal:", transformed_signal)
print("Reconstructed Signal:", f_reconstructed)
```

## Summary

Wavelet approximation is a powerful technique for representing functions with localized features using wavelets. The wavelet transform decomposes a function into different scales and translations, providing a time-frequency representation. Wavelet methods are widely used in signal processing, image compression, numerical analysis, and time-frequency analysis.
