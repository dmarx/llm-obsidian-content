## Karhunen–Loève Theorem

The [[Karhunen–Loève Theorem]], also known as the Karhunen–Loève Expansion or Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in the context of finite-dimensional spaces, is a fundamental result in the field of stochastic processes and functional analysis. It provides a way to represent a stochastic process in terms of an orthogonal basis of functions, which are the eigenfunctions of the covariance operator associated with the process. This theorem is particularly useful in signal processing, data compression, and pattern recognition.

### Statement of the Theorem

The Karhunen–Loève Theorem can be stated as follows:

*Let \( \{X(t) : t \in T\} \) be a second-order stochastic process with mean \( \mu(t) \) and covariance function \( K(s, t) \). Then \( X(t) \) can be represented as:*

$$
X(t) = \mu(t) + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} Z_n \phi_n(t)
$$

*where:*

- \( \{\phi_n(t)\} \) are the orthonormal eigenfunctions of the covariance operator associated with \( K(s, t) \),
- \( \{Z_n\} \) are uncorrelated random variables with zero mean and variances \( \{\lambda_n\} \), which are the eigenvalues corresponding to the eigenfunctions \( \{\phi_n(t)\} \).

### Mathematical Formalism

#### Covariance Operator

Let \( \mathcal{H} \) be a Hilbert space and \( K(s, t) \) be the covariance function of the process \( \{X(t)\} \):

$$
K(s, t) = \mathbb{E}[(X(s) - \mu(s))(X(t) - \mu(t))]
$$

The covariance operator \( T_K \) associated with \( K(s, t) \) is defined by:

$$
(T_K \phi)(t) = \int_T K(s, t) \phi(s) \, ds
$$

#### Eigenfunctions and Eigenvalues

The eigenfunctions \( \{\phi_n(t)\} \) and eigenvalues \( \{\lambda_n\} \) of the covariance operator \( T_K \) satisfy:

$$
\int_T K(s, t) \phi_n(s) \, ds = \lambda_n \phi_n(t)
$$

where \( \{\phi_n(t)\} \) forms an orthonormal basis of \( L^2(T) \) and \( \{\lambda_n\} \) are non-negative and ordered such that \( \lambda_1 \geq \lambda_2 \geq \ldots \geq 0 \).

#### Karhunen–Loève Expansion

The stochastic process \( \{X(t)\} \) can be expanded as:

$$
X(t) = \mu(t) + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} Z_n \phi_n(t)
$$

where \( Z_n = \int_T (X(s) - \mu(s)) \phi_n(s) \, ds \) are uncorrelated random variables with zero mean and variance \( \lambda_n \):

$$
\mathbb{E}[Z_n] = 0, \quad \mathbb{E}[Z_n Z_m] = \lambda_n \delta_{nm}
$$

### Implications and Applications

#### Data Compression

The Karhunen–Loève Theorem provides a method for data compression by allowing the representation of a stochastic process with a reduced number of significant components. By truncating the series after a finite number of terms, one can approximate the process with minimal loss of information, retaining only the largest eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunctions.

#### Signal Processing

In signal processing, the Karhunen–Loève Expansion is used for noise reduction and feature extraction. By projecting the signal onto the eigenfunctions corresponding to the largest eigenvalues, one can filter out noise and retain the most significant components of the signal.

#### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

In finite-dimensional spaces, the Karhunen–Loève Theorem is equivalent to PCA. It involves finding the principal components of a dataset, which are the directions along which the data varies the most. These principal components are the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of the data, and the corresponding eigenvalues indicate the amount of variance captured by each component.

### Example

Consider a stochastic process \( \{X(t)\} \) with mean zero and covariance function \( K(s, t) = e^{-|s - t|} \). The eigenfunctions \( \{\phi_n(t)\} \) of the covariance operator can be found by solving the integral equation:

$$
\int_0^1 e^{-|s - t|} \phi_n(s) \, ds = \lambda_n \phi_n(t)
$$

Suppose the eigenvalues are \( \lambda_n \) and the corresponding eigenfunctions are \( \phi_n(t) \). The Karhunen–Loève expansion of \( X(t) \) is:

$$
X(t) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} Z_n \phi_n(t)
$$

where \( Z_n \) are uncorrelated random variables with variance \( \lambda_n \).
