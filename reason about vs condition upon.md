**USER**

reason about vs condition upon


**ASSISTANT**

The user is asking me to author content for a technical reference wiki in the form of an Obsidian vault. They want me to explain the distinction between "reason about" vs "condition upon" - this seems to be a foundational conceptual distinction that would be important for an AI researcher, ML scientist, applied mathematician, and philosopher of mind to understand.

The user has specified:
- Graduate degrees in applied mathematics, statistics, and philosophy of science
- Wants deeply detailed, technical explanations with mathematical formalisms
- Fluent in advanced math but unaccustomed to physics conventions
- Should wrap novel phrases in double brackets for wiki-style links
- Should propose symbolic notation for modeling the topic
- Should respond only with wiki content, not conversationally
- Should not acknowledge the interaction

This distinction between "reasoning about" vs "conditioning upon" is fundamental in probability theory, machine learning, and philosophy of mind. It relates to:

1. The difference between having a model/representation of something vs. using that something as a constraint or input
2. In probability: reasoning about P(X) vs conditioning on X (i.e., P(Y|X))
3. In ML: learning representations vs. using features as inputs
4. In philosophy of mind: having mental models vs. being causally influenced by stimuli
5. In causal inference: modeling causal relationships vs. adjusting for confounders

I should provide a technical treatment that covers these different perspectives while maintaining mathematical rigor.# Reason About vs Condition Upon

## Conceptual Distinction

The fundamental distinction between **reasoning about** and **conditioning upon** represents a critical bifurcation in how [[cognitive systems]] and [[probabilistic models]] relate to information. This distinction underlies core problems in [[machine learning]], [[causal inference]], and [[philosophy of mind]].

**Reasoning about** X involves constructing, maintaining, or manipulating an [[internal representation]] or [[model]] of X. The system develops beliefs, predictions, or understanding concerning the properties, behavior, or relationships of X.

**Conditioning upon** X involves treating X as a given constraint, input, or boundary condition that shapes the system's processing without necessarily requiring an explicit model of X itself.

## Mathematical Formalization

Let $\mathcal{S}$ denote a [[cognitive system]] or [[computational agent]], and let $X$ be some [[information structure]] or [[random variable]].

### Reasoning About X

When $\mathcal{S}$ reasons about $X$, it maintains a [[belief state]] $\beta_\mathcal{S}(X)$ that encodes distributional information:

$$\beta_\mathcal{S}(X) = P_\mathcal{S}(X | \mathcal{K}_\mathcal{S})$$

where $\mathcal{K}_\mathcal{S}$ represents the system's [[knowledge base]] or [[prior information]]. The system can perform [[inference operations]]:

- **Prediction**: $\mathbb{E}_{\beta_\mathcal{S}}[f(X)]$ for functions $f$
- **Counterfactual reasoning**: $P_\mathcal{S}(X | \text{do}(Y=y), \mathcal{K}_\mathcal{S})$
- **Uncertainty quantification**: $\text{Var}_{\beta_\mathcal{S}}(X)$

### Conditioning Upon X

When $\mathcal{S}$ conditions upon $X$, it treats $X$ as a [[boundary condition]] that constrains its [[state space]] or [[decision space]]. The system's behavior becomes a function:

$$\mathcal{S}: X \mapsto \mathcal{R}$$

where $\mathcal{R}$ represents the system's [[response space]]. No explicit model $\beta_\mathcal{S}(X)$ need exist.

## Information-Theoretic Perspective

Let $I_\mathcal{S}(X)$ denote the [[mutual information]] between the system's internal states and $X$.

**Reasoning about X** typically involves:
$$I_\mathcal{S}(X) > 0 \text{ and } \exists \text{ explicit representation } R_X \subset \mathcal{S}$$

**Conditioning upon X** requires only:
$$\frac{\partial \mathcal{S}}{\partial X} \neq 0$$

The system's behavior depends on $X$ without necessarily maintaining high mutual information with $X$.

## Examples Across Domains

### Machine Learning

**Reasoning about**: A [[language model]] learning representations of semantic concepts, enabling it to answer questions about those concepts even in novel contexts.

**Conditioning upon**: A [[classifier]] that uses input features $X$ to predict $Y$ without modeling the distribution $P(X)$ or understanding what $X$ represents.

### Probability Theory

**Reasoning about**: Maintaining a [[prior distribution]] $P(\theta)$ over parameters and updating via [[Bayes' rule]]:
$$P(\theta | D) = \frac{P(D | \theta)P(\theta)}{P(D)}$$

**Conditioning upon**: Computing conditional expectations $\mathbb{E}[Y | X = x]$ where $X = x$ is treated as a fixed constraint.

### Philosophy of Mind

**Reasoning about**: [[Theory of mind]] - modeling other agents' beliefs, desires, and intentions.

**Conditioning upon**: [[Stimulus-response]] mechanisms where behavior changes based on environmental inputs without explicit modeling of those inputs.

## Computational Implications

The distinction has profound implications for [[computational complexity]] and [[sample efficiency]]:

### Resource Requirements

- **Reasoning about** typically requires $O(|\mathcal{X}|)$ [[memory complexity]] to store representations
- **Conditioning upon** may only require $O(1)$ memory for the [[mapping function]]

### Generalization

Let $\mathcal{D}_{\text{train}}$ and $\mathcal{D}_{\text{test}}$ denote training and test distributions.

**Reasoning about** enables [[distributional robustness]]:
$$\mathbb{E}_{x \sim \mathcal{D}_{\text{test}}}[L(\mathcal{S}(x), y)] \approx \mathbb{E}_{x \sim \mathcal{D}_{\text{train}}}[L(\mathcal{S}(x), y)]$$

when the system's model generalizes across distributions.

**Conditioning upon** may suffer from [[covariate shift]] when $\mathcal{D}_{\text{test}} \neq \mathcal{D}_{\text{train}}$.

## Hybrid Architectures

Many practical systems employ [[hybrid reasoning]] that combines both modes:

$$\mathcal{S}(X, Y) = \mathcal{C}(\mathcal{R}(X), Y)$$

where:
- $\mathcal{R}(X)$ represents reasoning about $X$ (producing representations)
- $\mathcal{C}(\cdot, Y)$ conditions upon both the representation and $Y$

This architecture appears in [[attention mechanisms]], [[memory networks]], and [[compositional reasoning]] systems.

## Philosophical Ramifications

The distinction connects to fundamental questions in [[philosophy of mind]]:

- **[[Intentionality]]**: Does reasoning about X require that mental states exhibit [[aboutness]]?
- **[[Consciousness]]**: Is conscious awareness better characterized as reasoning about or conditioning upon [[qualia]]?
- **[[Free will]]**: Does [[agency]] require reasoning about possible actions or merely conditioning upon [[decision variables]]?

The mathematical formalization suggests these may be [[degrees of freedom]] rather than binary distinctions, with systems exhibiting varying capacities for explicit representation versus implicit conditioning.
