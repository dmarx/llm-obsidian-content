Hawk-Dove-Bourgeois game


**ASSISTANT**

The **Hawk-Dove-Bourgeois game** is an extension of the classic [[Hawk-Dove game|Hawk-Dove]] model from evolutionary game theory, incorporating a third strategy: **Bourgeois**. This model is used to analyze more realistic conflict behaviors seen in nature, where individuals might use a conditional strategy based on territorial ownership or some other asymmetry.

### Strategies

In this game, there are three possible strategies:

- **Hawk:** Always escalate the conflict and fight aggressively for the resource.
- **Dove:** Avoid conflict; flee when confronted by a Hawk and share the resource with other Doves.
- **Bourgeois:** Play as a Hawk if you are the owner of the resource (or territory) and play as a Dove if you are the intruder.

### Motivation for the Bourgeois Strategy

The Bourgeois strategy introduces the idea that **asymmetry**—such as territorial ownership—can help resolve conflicts without costly fights. Many animals follow this behavior, where the individual with the prior claim to a resource behaves more aggressively, while the intruder acts submissively to avoid unnecessary conflict.

This kind of "conditional aggression" is common in nature because it reduces the cost of continuous fights over territory. Territorial animals, for example, often win simply because they are the current occupants, not because they are inherently stronger.

### Game Setup and Payoffs

In the Hawk-Dove-Bourgeois game, the payoffs depend on which strategies are employed, but the important factor is whether the Bourgeois is the **owner** or **intruder** of the contested resource.

Let’s assume that the resource has a value of $V$, and the cost of conflict is $C$.

1. **Hawk vs. Hawk:** Both engage in a fight, splitting the resource minus the cost of the conflict:
   $$ \text{Payoff: } \frac{V - C}{2} \text{ for both.} $$

2. **Hawk vs. Dove:** The Hawk wins the resource, and the Dove retreats:
   - **Hawk payoff:** $V$
   - **Dove payoff:** $0$

3. **Dove vs. Dove:** Both Doves share the resource peacefully:
   $$ \text{Payoff: } \frac{V}{2} \text{ for both.} $$

4. **Bourgeois vs. Hawk:** The Bourgeois fights if it is the owner of the resource and wins. If the Bourgeois is the intruder, it behaves like a Dove and retreats.
   - **Owner Bourgeois payoff:** $V$
   - **Intruder Bourgeois payoff:** $0$
   - **Hawk payoff:** $0$ (if Bourgeois is the owner) or $V$ (if Bourgeois is the intruder)

5. **Bourgeois vs. Dove:** The Bourgeois keeps the resource if it is the owner; otherwise, it shares with the Dove.
   - **Owner Bourgeois payoff:** $V$
   - **Intruder Bourgeois payoff:** $\frac{V}{2}$ (shared with Dove)
   - **Dove payoff:** $0$ (if Bourgeois is the owner) or $\frac{V}{2}$ (if Bourgeois is the intruder)

6. **Bourgeois vs. Bourgeois:** If both are Bourgeois, the one who owns the resource keeps it, while the other retreats:
   - **Owner payoff:** $V$
   - **Intruder payoff:** $0$

### Payoff Matrix

The resulting **payoff matrix** for the three strategies can be summarized as follows, assuming that the Bourgeois acts as the owner in half of the interactions and the intruder in the other half:

\[
\begin{array}{c|c c c}
& \text{Hawk} & \text{Dove} & \text{Bourgeois} \\
\hline
\text{Hawk} & \frac{V - C}{2}, \frac{V - C}{2} & V, 0 & 0, V \\
\text{Dove} & 0, V & \frac{V}{2}, \frac{V}{2} & 0, \frac{V}{2} \\
\text{Bourgeois} & V, 0 & \frac{V}{2}, 0 & \frac{V}{2}, \frac{V}{2} \\
\end{array}
\]

### Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS)

To determine an **Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS)**, we need to analyze when a population’s strategy mix reaches stability. An ESS is a strategy that, once adopted by most of the population, cannot be invaded by a small number of mutants with alternative strategies.

1. **Bourgeois as an ESS:** The Bourgeois strategy can be an ESS in many realistic contexts because it avoids the high cost of fights and uses ownership asymmetry to settle disputes. If the cost of fighting ($C$) is much larger than the value of the resource ($V$), then Hawk becomes an inefficient strategy, and Bourgeois will dominate.

2. **Mixed Strategy Equilibria:** A mixed equilibrium can exist where Hawks, Doves, and Bourgeois strategies coexist in the population. To find such an equilibrium, we would calculate the expected payoffs for each strategy and set them equal to find the proportion of each in the population.

### Mixed Nash Equilibrium Calculation

Let the population consist of proportions $p_H$ Hawks, $p_D$ Doves, and $p_B$ Bourgeois. The expected payoffs for each strategy are:

- **Hawk expected payoff**:
  \[
  \Pi_H = p_H \cdot \frac{V - C}{2} + p_D \cdot V + p_B \cdot 0
  \]

- **Dove expected payoff**:
  \[
  \Pi_D = p_H \cdot 0 + p_D \cdot \frac{V}{2} + p_B \cdot 0
  \]

- **Bourgeois expected payoff**:
  \[
  \Pi_B = p_H \cdot V + p_D \cdot \frac{V}{2} + p_B \cdot \frac{V}{2}
  \]

For a mixed Nash equilibrium, the expected payoffs of the strategies must be equal, i.e., $\Pi_H = \Pi_D = \Pi_B$. Solving these conditions gives the equilibrium proportions of Hawks, Doves, and Bourgeois individuals in the population.

### Interpretation of the Hawk-Dove-Bourgeois Game

The **Hawk-Dove-Bourgeois game** provides a more realistic model for understanding conflict in biological systems. The Bourgeois strategy is often evolutionarily stable because it allows individuals to avoid costly fights while still securing resources based on ownership. This helps explain why in nature, territoriality and respect for ownership claims are common, as they lead to more stable and less costly resolutions of conflict.

In summary, the Bourgeois strategy plays a crucial role in stabilizing populations where resources are contested and where avoiding unnecessary conflicts is beneficial. This makes the Hawk-Dove-Bourgeois game a richer and more applicable model than the classic Hawk-Dove game.
