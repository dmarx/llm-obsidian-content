## Evolutionary Strategies

### Overview

Evolutionary strategies (ES) are optimization algorithms inspired by the process of natural evolution, much like genetic algorithms. However, they differ in various aspects, particularly in their approach to mutation, recombination, and selection. ES are primarily used for continuous optimization problems and are characterized by self-adaptive mechanisms for strategy parameters.

### Basic Concepts

1. **Population**: A collection of candidate solutions (individuals) to the optimization problem.
2. **Individuals**: Candidate solutions represented by a vector of real numbers.
3. **Objective Function**: The function to be optimized, often denoted as \( f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R} \).
4. **Strategy Parameters**: Parameters that control the mutation process, often included in the individual’s representation.
5. **Selection**: The process of choosing the next generation from the current population based on their fitness.
6. **Recombination (Crossover)**: Combining two or more parents to generate offspring.
7. **Mutation**: Introducing variations to individuals, typically involving modifications to both the solution vector and the strategy parameters.

### Algorithmic Steps

1. **Initialization**: Generate an initial population of individuals, each represented by a solution vector and associated strategy parameters.
2. **Evaluation**: Compute the fitness of each individual using the objective function.
3. **Recombination**: Combine parents to produce offspring. ES commonly use intermediate and discrete recombination.
4. **Mutation**: Apply mutations to offspring, altering both their solution vectors and strategy parameters.
5. **Selection**: Select individuals for the next generation based on their fitness. Common strategies include $(\mu, \lambda)$ and $(\mu + \lambda)$ selection.
6. **Termination**: Repeat the evaluation-recombination-mutation-selection cycle until a stopping criterion is met, such as a maximum number of generations or a satisfactory fitness level.

### Mathematical Formalism

#### Individual Representation

An individual in ES is typically represented as \( (\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{\sigma}) \), where:

- \( \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n \) is the solution vector.
- \( \mathbf{\sigma} \in \mathbb{R}^n \) are the strategy parameters (e.g., mutation step sizes).

#### Mutation

The mutation operation in ES involves modifying both the solution vector \( \mathbf{x} \) and the strategy parameters \( \mathbf{\sigma} \). A common approach is Gaussian mutation:

$$
\sigma_i' = \sigma_i \exp(\tau' N(0,1) + \tau N_i(0,1))
$$

$$
x_i' = x_i + \sigma_i' N_i(0,1)
$$

Here, \( \tau \) and \( \tau' \) are learning rates, and \( N(0,1) \) denotes a standard normal distribution.

#### Recombination

- **Intermediate Recombination**: Offspring are created by averaging the parents’ values:

$$
x_i' = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{j=1}^k x_i^j
$$

- **Discrete Recombination**: Offspring genes are chosen randomly from parents’ genes:

$$
x_i' = x_i^{p(i)}
$$

where \( p(i) \) is a randomly chosen parent index for gene \( i \).

#### Selection Mechanisms

- **$(\mu, \lambda)$ Selection**: Select the best \( \mu \) individuals from the \( \lambda \) offspring.
- **$(\mu + \lambda)$ Selection**: Select the best \( \mu \) individuals from the combined set of \( \mu \) parents and \( \lambda \) offspring.

### Strategy Parameter Adaptation

A distinguishing feature of ES is the adaptation of strategy parameters, particularly the mutation step sizes \( \mathbf{\sigma} \). This self-adaptation allows the algorithm to fine-tune its search process dynamically. The adaptation rules often involve both global and individual learning rates, which control how the mutation step sizes evolve over generations.

### Applications

Evolutionary strategies are applied in various domains, including:

- **Engineering Design**: Optimization of complex engineering systems and processes.
- **Robotics**: Path planning, control, and learning for autonomous systems.
- **Economics and Finance**: Modeling and optimization of economic systems and financial portfolios.
- **Machine Learning**: Hyperparameter tuning and neural network training.

### Conclusion

Evolutionary strategies offer a robust and adaptive approach to continuous optimization problems. By incorporating mechanisms for the self-adaptation of strategy parameters, ES can efficiently explore and exploit complex search spaces. Their flexibility and effectiveness make them suitable for a wide range of applications in engineering, finance, robotics, and beyond.
