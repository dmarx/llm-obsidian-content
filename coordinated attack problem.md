**USER**

Coordinated Attack Problem


**ASSISTANT**

The **Coordinated Attack Problem** is a classic problem in distributed systems that formalizes the difficulties of achieving agreement between parties in the presence of unreliable communication. It is closely related to the **Two Generals Problem** and focuses on the impossibility of achieving guaranteed coordination when messages can be lost or delayed.

## Problem Overview

### Scenario

- **Participants:** There are two or more parties (e.g., generals, processes, nodes) that need to coordinate an action (such as an attack on an enemy) at an agreed-upon time.
- **Objective:** The parties must agree on a coordinated action. The action should only occur if every party is aware that the others are ready to proceed.
- **Communication:** The parties can only communicate through an unreliable communication medium (e.g., sending messengers or packets over a network) that can lose messages or deliver them out of order.

### Example: Two Generals

Imagine two generals, General A and General B, who must coordinate a simultaneous attack on an enemy position. If both attack together, they will win; if only one attacks, that general will lose. To succeed, they must ensure that both are absolutely certain that the other will attack.

1. **General A** sends a messenger to General B proposing a time to attack.
2. **General B**, upon receiving the message, sends back an acknowledgment to General A confirming receipt.
3. **General A** then sends another acknowledgment back to General B to confirm that the acknowledgment was received.
4. This process could go on indefinitely because, after every message, there is still uncertainty about whether the last acknowledgment was successfully received.

### The Core Issue

The crux of the **Coordinated Attack Problem** is that **no finite number of message exchanges can guarantee that both parties will know with certainty that the other party is aware of the coordinated plan**. The fundamental uncertainty arises from the fact that each acknowledgment requires another acknowledgment to confirm its receipt, leading to an infinite regress. Therefore, if the coordination is based on unreliable communication, there is always some nonzero probability that a critical message was lost.

## Formalization of the Problem

Suppose the generals (or processes) communicate by sending messages through a communication channel that might lose messages. The problem can be formalized using **knowledge theory**:

1. **Initial Knowledge:** Each general has local information (e.g., "I intend to attack at dawn").
2. **Shared Knowledge:** They need to establish that all participants share the intention to attack. That is, they need to reach **common knowledge**.
3. **Unreliable Communication:** The messages sent between generals may be lost. This means a general cannot be sure if the other has received its message unless explicitly acknowledged.
4. **Agreement:** Both generals need to agree to attack and know that the other has agreed.

The formal objective is to establish a state where both generals have **common knowledge** of the attack plan. However, since each acknowledgment creates another layer of uncertainty (e.g., "Did my acknowledgment reach the other general?"), common knowledge becomes impossible to achieve under unreliable communication.

### Why Coordination Is Impossible

The impossibility arises from the need for **mutual knowledge**:
- For General A to attack, General A must know that General B received the attack message.
- For General B to agree, General B must know that General A received the acknowledgment.
- For General A to act, General A must know that General B knows that A received the acknowledgment.

This chain of knowledge requires an infinite series of messages to confirm. In practice, however, message delivery is uncertain. Therefore, at some point, both generals must decide to act without being certain that the other is aware of the plan, resulting in a non-guaranteed coordination.

### Proof of Impossibility

The impossibility can be shown via induction:

1. Suppose a protocol exists that allows coordination with just one message. The recipient cannot be sure that the sender knows they received the message because the sender would need an acknowledgment.
2. Suppose the protocol requires $n$ messages to achieve coordination. After the $(n-1)$th message, there is still no guarantee that the $(n-1)$th message was received, which would necessitate an $n$th acknowledgment, and so on.
3. Hence, for any finite $n$, there is no protocol that guarantees coordination since the final acknowledgment would always leave room for uncertainty.

## Relation to the **Two Generals Problem**

The **Coordinated Attack Problem** generalizes the **Two Generals Problem**:
- In the **Two Generals Problem**, two parties must agree on a plan of action but cannot achieve absolute certainty due to unreliable communication.
- The **Coordinated Attack Problem** extends this idea to any scenario where parties attempt to reach common knowledge through unreliable messaging.

Both problems illustrate the fundamental challenge of achieving **common knowledge** in distributed systems: even if parties exchange many messages, there is no way to be 100% certain that all parties share the same information if communication is unreliable.

## Implications in Distributed Systems

The **Coordinated Attack Problem** has significant implications for distributed computing and network protocols:
- **Consensus Protocols:** It demonstrates that guaranteed consensus (where all nodes agree on a decision) is impossible in asynchronous systems with unreliable communication, which laid the foundation for more practical consensus algorithms like **Paxos** and **Raft**.
- **Network Protocols:** In real-world distributed systems, absolute guarantees of coordination are not feasible. Instead, practical systems rely on probabilistic guarantees (e.g., eventually, the messages will be received) or timeouts to make decisions.
- **Consistency Models:** The problem influences consistency models in distributed databases. It underscores why certain guarantees, like **strong consistency**, are challenging to maintain in the face of network partitions or message loss.

## Summary

The **Coordinated Attack Problem** captures the impossibility of achieving guaranteed coordination between parties when communicating over an unreliable medium. It shows that no finite communication protocol can ensure common knowledge among parties if there is a chance of message loss. This impossibility result highlights the intrinsic limitations of [[distributed consensus]] and coordination and informs the design of practical algorithms and protocols that aim to work within these constraints by making probabilistic, rather than absolute, guarantees.
