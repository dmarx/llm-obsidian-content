Strouhal number


**ASSISTANT**

The **Strouhal number** (St) is a dimensionless quantity used in fluid dynamics to describe oscillating flow mechanisms, particularly in the context of vortex shedding, unsteady flow, and fluid-structure interactions. It is named after the Czech physicist Vincenc Strouhal, who first studied the frequency of vortex shedding from wires.

### 1. **Definition**

The Strouhal number is defined as:

$$
St = \frac{fL}{U},
$$

where:
- \( f \) is the characteristic frequency of the oscillation (e.g., the frequency of vortex shedding),
- \( L \) is a characteristic length (such as the diameter of a cylinder in flow),
- \( U \) is the flow velocity (the free-stream velocity of the fluid).

### 2. **Physical Interpretation**

The Strouhal number relates the frequency of a periodic phenomenon in a flow field to the flow velocity and a characteristic length scale. It essentially measures the ratio of inertial forces (related to the flow velocity and characteristic length) to the frequency of oscillation.

### 3. **Applications and Significance**

The Strouhal number is widely used to characterize various types of unsteady flows, including:

#### **Vortex Shedding**
- **Von K치rm치n Vortex Street**: In the flow past bluff bodies like cylinders, vortices are shed alternately from either side of the body, creating a repeating pattern known as a von K치rm치n vortex street. The frequency of vortex shedding \( f \) can be predicted using the Strouhal number.

- **Vortex-Induced Vibrations (VIV)**: In engineering, the Strouhal number is crucial for understanding vortex-induced vibrations, where the oscillating forces from vortex shedding can induce vibrations in structures like chimneys, bridges, and offshore pipelines.

#### **Unsteady Flow Phenomena**
- The Strouhal number is also used to characterize other [[unsteady flow phenomena]] such as oscillating airfoils, pulsatile blood flow, and flow around flapping wings.

#### **Flow Measurement and Control**
- **Flow Meters**: Devices like vortex flow meters use the Strouhal number to relate the frequency of vortex shedding to the flow velocity, allowing for accurate flow measurements.

- **Aeroacoustics**: The Strouhal number is important in aeroacoustics, where the oscillatory nature of flows (like those around aircraft wings or propellers) generates sound.

### 4. **Typical Values**

The Strouhal number tends to vary depending on the Reynolds number (Re) and the specific geometry of the body in the flow. For a circular cylinder, the Strouhal number typically has a value of approximately 0.2 over a wide range of Reynolds numbers (from about 100 to 100,000), meaning that the frequency of vortex shedding is about one-fifth of the ratio of the flow velocity to the diameter of the cylinder.

### 5. **Scaling and Similarity**

In fluid dynamics, the Strouhal number is part of the broader concept of dynamic similarity. When flows are geometrically similar and share the same Strouhal number, their flow patterns and oscillatory behaviors are also similar, even if the absolute scales (length, time, and velocity) are different.

This similarity is useful in scaling laboratory experiments to predict the behavior of larger-scale systems, such as using wind tunnel tests to model the flow around full-sized aircraft.

### 6. **Conclusion**

The Strouhal number is a fundamental dimensionless parameter in fluid dynamics that characterizes the frequency of oscillatory flow phenomena relative to the flow velocity and characteristic length. Its importance extends across a wide range of applications, from predicting vortex shedding and related vibrations in structures to designing flow measurement devices and understanding unsteady flow behaviors.
