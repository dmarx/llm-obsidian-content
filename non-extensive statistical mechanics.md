# Non-extensive Statistical Mechanics

[[Non-extensive statistical mechanics]] is a generalization of the standard [[Boltzmann-Gibbs statistical mechanics]] that addresses systems with long-range interactions, long-time memory effects, or evolving in a multifractal space-time. Introduced and developed by [[Constantino Tsallis]] in 1988, this framework provides mathematical tools to analyze complex systems where the traditional extensive property of entropy breaks down.

## Fundamental Concepts

### Non-extensivity

In classical [[statistical mechanics]], a system is considered extensive if its thermodynamic properties (like energy, entropy) scale linearly with system size. Mathematically, for two independent systems $A$ and $B$:

$$S_{BG}(A+B) = S_{BG}(A) + S_{BG}(B)$$

where $S_{BG}$ represents the [[Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy]].

In non-extensive systems, this additivity breaks down due to correlations, interactions, or constraints. Instead, for the [[Tsallis entropy]] $S_q$:

$$S_q(A+B) = S_q(A) + S_q(B) + (1-q)S_q(A)S_q(B)$$

where $q$ is the [[entropic index]] characterizing the degree of non-extensivity.

### Entropic Index

The parameter $q$ quantifies the departure from extensivity:
- $q = 1$: Recovers the standard Boltzmann-Gibbs theory
- $q > 1$: Sub-extensive systems (super-additive)
- $q < 1$: Super-extensive systems (sub-additive)

## Mathematical Formalism

### Tsallis Entropy

The cornerstone of non-extensive statistical mechanics is the [[Tsallis entropy]]:

$$S_q = k \frac{1-\sum_{i=1}^W p_i^q}{q-1}$$

where $k$ is a constant (analogous to Boltzmann's constant), $W$ is the total number of microscopic states, and $p_i$ is the probability of the system being in state $i$.

### $q$-Algebra

Non-extensive statistical mechanics introduces a generalized algebra:

- [[q-exponential]]: $\exp_q(x) = [1+(1-q)x]_+^{1/(1-q)}$ where $[y]_+ = \max(0,y)$
- [[q-logarithm]]: $\ln_q(x) = \frac{x^{1-q}-1}{1-q}$
- [[q-product]]: $x \otimes_q y = [x^{1-q} + y^{1-q} - 1]_+^{1/(1-q)}$
- [[q-sum]]: $x \oplus_q y = x + y + (1-q)xy$

These operations satisfy properties like:
- $\ln_q(\exp_q(x)) = x$
- $\exp_q(\ln_q(x)) = x$
- $\ln_q(x \otimes_q y) = \ln_q(x) + \ln_q(y)$

### Generalized Distributions

The [[maximum entropy principle]] applied to Tsallis entropy under appropriate constraints yields probability distributions that often follow power laws rather than exponential decays:

- [[q-Gaussian distribution]]: $p(x) \propto \exp_q(-\beta x^2)$
- [[q-exponential distribution]]: $p(x) \propto \exp_q(-\beta x)$

These distributions exhibit [[heavy tails]] for $q > 1$, making them suitable for modeling phenomena with extreme events.

## Physical Mechanisms for Non-extensivity

Several physical mechanisms can lead to non-extensive behavior:

1. **[[Long-range interactions]]**: Systems where the interaction potential decays slower than $r^{-d}$ (where $d$ is the spatial dimension)
2. **[[Long-term memory]]**: Systems with non-Markovian dynamics and strong historical dependencies
3. **[[Multifractal space-time]]**: Systems evolving in spaces with fractal or hierarchical structures
4. **[[Quantum entanglement]]**: Quantum systems with non-local correlations

## Theoretical Framework

### Generalized H-Theorem

The [[H-theorem]] has been extended to non-extensive systems, demonstrating that Tsallis entropy increases monotonically until reaching equilibrium under appropriate dynamics:

$$\frac{dS_q}{dt} \geq 0$$

### Generalized Fluctuation-Dissipation Relations

The standard [[fluctuation-dissipation theorem]] is modified in non-extensive systems, leading to [[q-generalized fluctuation-dissipation relations]].

### Non-extensive Thermodynamics

Thermodynamic relations are generalized with the introduction of:

- [[Escort probabilities]]: $P_i^{(q)} = \frac{p_i^q}{\sum_j p_j^q}$
- [[Generalized free energy]]: $F_q = U_q - TS_q$
- [[Generalized temperature]]: Related to the standard temperature through non-linear transformations

## Mathematical Structure

The formal structure of non-extensive statistical mechanics can be represented through:

1. **[[Generalized information geometry]]**: A Riemannian geometric framework where the metric tensor is derived from the Hessian of the Tsallis entropy
2. **[[Deformed exponential families]]**: Generalizations of exponential families based on q-deformations
3. **[[Non-additive composition laws]]**: Mathematical rules governing how thermodynamic quantities combine

5. Cosmic ray spectra

## Connection to Other Theories

Non-extensive statistical mechanics connects with several related frameworks:

- **[[Superstatistics]]**: Interprets non-extensivity as arising from fluctuations in intensive parameters
- **[[Generalized entropies]]**: Relates to other entropy formulations like [[Rényi entropy]] and [[Sharma-Mittal entropy]]
- **[[Fractional calculus]]**: Links with fractional differential equations describing anomalous dynamics
- **[[Information geometry]]**: Provides a geometric interpretation of thermodynamic states in non-extensive systems

## Criticisms and Limitations

Despite its successes, non-extensive statistical mechanics faces several critiques:

- Questions about the physical interpretation of the parameter $q$
- Concerns about the uniqueness of $q$ for a given system
- Debates about its consistency with traditional thermodynamic principles
- Challenges in deriving $q$ from first principles for specific systems

## Open Research Questions

Current research directions include:

1. Deriving the entropic index $q$ from microscopic dynamics
2. Developing rigorous mathematical foundations for non-extensive thermodynamics
3. Extending the theory to quantum systems
4. Unifying with other theoretical frameworks for complex systems
