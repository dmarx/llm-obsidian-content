One Electron Theory


**ASSISTANT**

The **One-Electron Theory** is a conceptual framework primarily attributed to John Archibald Wheeler and Richard Feynman. This theory proposes that all electrons in the universe are, in fact, manifestations of a single electron moving backward and forward in time. While the idea itself is not widely accepted as a serious physical model, it serves as an intriguing thought experiment that explores the nature of particles, antiparticles, and time in the context of quantum mechanics and relativistic quantum field theory.

### Concept Overview

In quantum field theory, an electron is represented as a particle that can move through space and time. The **One-Electron Theory** suggests that the seemingly vast number of electrons in the universe could be explained by considering them as different appearances of the same electron, traversing a complex path through spacetime.

The theory hinges on a few critical ideas:

1. **Time Symmetry**: In quantum electrodynamics (QED), the equations governing particle dynamics are time-reversal symmetric. This implies that the laws of physics would look the same if time were to flow backward. This symmetry allows for the conceptualization of particles moving forward in time and antiparticles (such as positrons) moving backward in time.

2. **Electron-Positron Pairs**: An electron moving forward in time can be mathematically equivalent to a positron (the electron's antiparticle) moving backward in time. Therefore, a single electron zigzagging through time could account for the existence of both electrons and positrons.

3. **Worldline**: The concept of a **worldline** in spacetime describes the trajectory of a particle. In this theory, the worldline of the one electron is a complex path that spans the entire universe, moving forward and backward in time multiple times. Each crossing of the electron's path through a specific point in time and space corresponds to an instance of the appearance of an electron or positron.

### Mathematical Formalism

While the **One-Electron Theory** is more of a philosophical notion than a formalized physical theory, we can explore the idea using mathematical constructs from quantum field theory and Feynman diagrams.

In QED, the **propagator** function describes the probability amplitude for an electron to travel from one point in spacetime to another. For an electron moving forward in time, the propagator is given by:

$$
S_F(x - y) = \langle 0 | T\{\psi(x) \bar{\psi}(y)\} | 0 \rangle,
$$

where $S_F(x - y)$ is the Feynman propagator, $\psi(x)$ is the electron field operator at spacetime point $x$, $\bar{\psi}(y)$ is the adjoint field operator at point $y$, and $T$ denotes the time-ordering operator.

For an antiparticle, like a positron, the corresponding amplitude involves a similar propagator but interpreted in reverse time.

### Implications and Interpretation

The **One-Electron Theory** challenges the traditional notion of particle individuality by implying that all electrons are indistinguishable because they are literally the same entity. This perspective fits well with the [[Fermionic Symmetry|Pauli Exclusion Principle]] and the indistinguishability of particles in quantum mechanics, where exchanging two electrons does not lead to an observable difference in the system.

However, the theory is purely speculative and mainly serves as a way to illustrate the peculiarities of quantum mechanics, such as:

- **Particle-Antiparticle Duality**: Understanding that particles and their antiparticles could be two manifestations of the same entity viewed under different time directions.
- **Feynman Diagrams**: The theory also provides an intuitive basis for Feynman diagrams, where electron-positron creation and annihilation can be visualized as parts of a single worldline with time-reversed segments.

### Critical Evaluation

There are several reasons why the **One-Electron Theory** is not adopted as a physical theory:

- **Initial Conditions and Constraints**: For the theory to hold true, the electron's path would need to account for all observed electrons and positrons in the universe, as well as their observed distribution and properties. This would imply highly specific initial conditions that are not naturally justified.
- **Charge Conservation**: While the theory offers a novel interpretation of particle interactions, it does not provide additional predictive power or help to resolve fundamental questions about charge conservation or why electrons have the properties they do.
- **Lack of Experimental Evidence**: There is no experimental evidence that supports the idea that all electrons are the same particle moving through time.

### Conclusion

The **One-Electron Theory** is an interesting thought experiment in theoretical physics that illustrates the counterintuitive nature of quantum mechanics and the possible reinterpretation of particles and antiparticles in the framework of spacetime symmetry. While it is not a viable physical theory, it enriches the conceptual landscape of quantum theory and highlights the role of time in the quantum description of particles.
