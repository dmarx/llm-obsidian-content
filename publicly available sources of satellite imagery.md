publicly available sources of satellite imagery


**ASSISTANT**

Satellite imagery is an invaluable resource for a wide range of applications, including environmental monitoring, urban planning, agriculture, and disaster response. There are several publicly available sources where you can access satellite imagery, ranging from raw data to processed images. Below is an overview of some prominent platforms and services:

### 1. **[[Landsat]] (USGS)**
   - **Description**: The Landsat program, managed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), is one of the most well-known sources of satellite imagery. It has been capturing images of the Earth's surface since 1972.
   - **Data Access**: Landsat data is available for free through the USGS EarthExplorer, GloVis, and LandsatLook Viewer portals.
   - **Image Characteristics**: The most recent satellite, Landsat 9, provides imagery with a spatial resolution of 30 meters for most bands and 15 meters for the panchromatic band.

### 2. **[[Sentinel (Satellite Constellation)|Sentinel Satellites]] (Copernicus Program)**
   - **Description**: The Sentinel satellites are part of the Copernicus Program managed by the European Space Agency (ESA). This constellation provides a variety of earth observation data.
   - **Data Access**: Sentinel data can be accessed for free via the Copernicus Open Access Hub, the Copernicus Data and Information Access Services (DIAS), and other platforms like Sentinel Hub.
   - **Image Characteristics**: Sentinel-2, for instance, provides imagery with resolutions ranging from 10 to 60 meters across different spectral bands.

### 3. **[[MODIS]] (NASA)**
   - **Description**: The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is a key instrument on NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites, providing daily global coverage.
   - **Data Access**: MODIS data is accessible via NASA’s Earthdata platform and other portals like LAADS DAAC.
   - **Image Characteristics**: MODIS offers moderate resolution imagery (250m to 1km), suitable for large-scale environmental monitoring.

### 4. **[[ASTER]] (NASA/USGS)**
   - **Description**: The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) provides high-resolution images and is useful for detailed studies of the Earth's surface.
   - **Data Access**: ASTER data is available through the LP DAAC (Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center) and NASA Earthdata.
   - **Image Characteristics**: ASTER images come with resolutions up to 15 meters in the visible and near-infrared bands.

### 5. **Google Earth Engine**
   - **Description**: Google Earth Engine is a powerful cloud-based platform that provides access to a vast amount of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets.
   - **Data Access**: Users can access various datasets, including Landsat, Sentinel, MODIS, and many others, through the platform’s API or web interface.
   - **Image Characteristics**: The platform allows for advanced data processing and visualization, integrating datasets from multiple sources.

### 6. **[[Planet Labs]]**
   - **Description**: Planet Labs operates a fleet of small satellites called Doves, which capture daily images of the entire Earth.
   - **Data Access**: While most data from Planet Labs is commercial, they do provide some imagery for free for educational and humanitarian purposes via the Planet Explorer platform.
   - **Image Characteristics**: Planet Labs provides high-resolution images with a spatial resolution of 3 to 5 meters.

### 7. **NASA Worldview**
   - **Description**: NASA Worldview is a visualization tool that provides near-real-time satellite imagery.
   - **Data Access**: The platform allows users to view and download satellite images from various NASA instruments, including MODIS and VIIRS.
   - **Image Characteristics**: Worldview offers interactive exploration of imagery and overlays from different time periods.

### 8. **Copernicus Open Access Hub**
   - **Description**: This is a primary portal for accessing Sentinel data. Managed by ESA, it provides free and open access to Copernicus Sentinel satellite data.
   - **Data Access**: The portal is mainly used by professional users who need direct access to data products for analysis.
   - **Image Characteristics**: Users can download Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Sentinel-3 data, which includes radar and optical imagery.

### 9. **National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Earthdata Search**
   - **Description**: Earthdata Search provides access to a wide range of datasets from various NASA missions, including MODIS, Landsat, and others.
   - **Data Access**: Users can search and download data directly through the Earthdata web interface.
   - **Image Characteristics**: The platform supports a variety of file formats and allows for customization of data retrieval.

### 10. **[[USGS EarthExplorer]]**
   - **Description**: EarthExplorer is a tool from the USGS that provides access to satellite images, aerial photographs, and cartographic products.
   - **Data Access**: EarthExplorer offers free access to a wide range of datasets, including Landsat, MODIS, and others.
   - **Image Characteristics**: The tool allows for detailed searches by geographic area, date, and other criteria.

These platforms and services provide extensive access to satellite imagery, suitable for various levels of analysis, from academic research to practical applications. Many of them offer free data, making them accessible for a wide range of users.
