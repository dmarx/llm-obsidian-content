### Doob's Martingale Inequalities

**Doob's Martingale Inequalities** are a set of fundamental results in the theory of [[martingales]], which provide bounds on the probabilities and expectations of the supremum of a martingale. These inequalities are crucial in understanding the behavior of [[martingales]] and have significant applications in probability theory, stochastic processes, and mathematical finance.

### Key Inequalities

#### 1. **Doob's Maximal Inequality for Non-Negative Submartingales**

Let \( \{M_t\}_{t \geq 0} \) be a non-negative submartingale. For any \( \lambda > 0 \) and stopping time \( \tau \),

$$
P\left( \sup_{0 \leq s \leq t} M_s \geq \lambda \right) \leq \frac{E[M_t]}{\lambda}.
$$

#### 2. **Doob's \(L^p\) Inequality**

Let \( \{M_t\}_{t \geq 0} \) be a martingale or a non-negative submartingale. For \( 1 \leq p < \infty \),

$$
E\left[\left( \sup_{0 \leq s \leq t} |M_s| \right)^p \right] \leq \left( \frac{p}{p-1} \right)^p E[|M_t|^p].
$$

For \( p = 2 \), this simplifies to:

$$
E\left[\left( \sup_{0 \leq s \leq t} |M_s|^2 \right)\right] \leq 4 E[|M_t|^2].
$$

### Applications

#### 1. **Probability Bounds**

Doob's Maximal Inequality provides a way to bound the probability that a martingale exceeds a certain level by the expected value of the martingale at a fixed time. This is particularly useful in risk management and financial mathematics for bounding the probabilities of extreme events.

#### 2. **Moment Bounds**

Doob's \(L^p\) Inequality allows for the bounding of the moments of the supremum of a martingale. This is useful in ensuring that the expected maximum deviation of a process is controlled, which has applications in option pricing and the assessment of financial risk.

### Proof Sketches

#### 1. **Doob's Maximal Inequality for Non-Negative Submartingales**

Let \( \tau \) be the stopping time defined as:

$$
\tau = \inf\{ s \leq t : M_s \geq \lambda \},
$$

and consider the stopped martingale \( M_{s \wedge \tau} \). Since \( M_t \) is a non-negative submartingale:

$$
E[M_{t \wedge \tau}] \leq E[M_t].
$$

By the definition of \( \tau \), \( M_{t \wedge \tau} \) is bounded by \( \lambda \). Hence,

$$
P\left( \sup_{0 \leq s \leq t} M_s \geq \lambda \right) \leq \frac{E[M_t]}{\lambda}.
$$

#### 2. **Doob's \(L^p\) Inequality**

For \( p \geq 1 \), consider the non-negative submartingale \( M_t^p \). Using the maximal function \( M^*_t = \sup_{0 \leq s \leq t} |M_s| \):

$$
M^*_t = \sup_{0 \leq s \leq t} |M_s|.
$$

Applying the maximal inequality to \( M_t^p \):

$$
E[M_t^p] \geq \left( \frac{p-1}{p} \right)^p E[(M^*_t)^p].
$$

Thus,

$$
E[(M^*_t)^p] \leq \left( \frac{p}{p-1} \right)^p E[M_t^p].
$$

### Example: Application in Option Pricing

Consider a European call option with payoff \( (S_T - K)^+ \). Let \( \{S_t\}_{0 \leq t \leq T} \) be the stock price process under the risk-neutral measure. Using Doob's martingale inequalities, we can bound the probability that the stock price exceeds a certain level \( L \) at any time \( t \):

$$
P\left( \sup_{0 \leq s \leq T} S_s \geq L \right) \leq \frac{E[S_T]}{L}.
$$

If \( S_t \) is a martingale, then \( E[S_T] = S_0 e^{rT} \), where \( r \) is the risk-free rate. Thus,

$$
P\left( \sup_{0 \leq s \leq T} S_s \geq L \right) \leq \frac{S_0 e^{rT}}{L}.
$$

This provides a way to quantify the risk of the stock price reaching a certain level, which is useful for managing the risk of options and other financial derivatives.

### Conclusion

Doob's Martingale Inequalities are powerful tools in probability theory, providing bounds on the supremum of [[martingales]] and submartingales. These inequalities have important applications in various fields, particularly in finance for managing and quantifying risk. Understanding these inequalities is essential for anyone working with stochastic processes and their applications.
