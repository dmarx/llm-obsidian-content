**ASSISTANT**

The **Machin-like formula** refers to a class of expressions that compute $\pi$ using arctangents of rational numbers. These formulas generalize the original formula discovered by [[John Machin]] in 1706, which is a clever application of the **inverse tangent identity**:

$$
\pi = 4 \left( 4 \arctan \left( \frac{1}{5} \right) - \arctan \left( \frac{1}{239} \right) \right)
$$

This equation leverages the rapidly converging series for the arctangent, derived from its Taylor series expansion:

$$
\arctan(x) = x - \frac{x^3}{3} + \frac{x^5}{5} - \frac{x^7}{7} + \dots
$$

By selecting small rational values for $x$, such as $x = \frac{1}{5}$ and $x = \frac{1}{239}$, the series converges faster, making it computationally efficient for determining many digits of $\pi$. 

In general, a Machin-like formula for $\pi$ takes the form:

$$
\pi = 4 \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i \arctan\left(\frac{1}{b_i}\right)
$$

where $a_i$ and $b_i$ are rational numbers chosen such that the identity holds. The goal is to balance terms in a way that maximizes the rate of convergence.

### Did you know?
Some of the fastest known algorithms for computing $\pi$ use *thousands* of Machin-like formulas simultaneously to achieve high precision, enabling computations into the trillions of digits!
