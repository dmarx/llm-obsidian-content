### Contingent Derivative

The contingent derivative, also known as the Bouligand derivative, is a concept in set-valued analysis that generalizes the classical derivative to set-valued maps. It captures the idea of how a set-valued map changes in a given direction.

### Definition

Consider a set-valued map \( F: \mathbb{R}^n \to 2^{\mathbb{R}^m} \). The contingent derivative of \( F \) at a point \( x \in \mathbb{R}^n \) in the direction \( v \in \mathbb{R}^n \) is defined as:
$$
DF(x; v) = \left\{ w \in \mathbb{R}^m \mid \exists \{t_k\} \downarrow 0, \{v_k\} \to v, \{w_k\} \to w, \text{ such that } w_k \in \frac{F(x + t_k v_k) - F(x)}{t_k} \text{ for all } k \right\}.
$$
This definition expresses that \( w \) is a contingent derivative of \( F \) at \( x \) in the direction \( v \) if it can be approximated by secant vectors \( \frac{F(x + t_k v_k) - F(x)}{t_k} \) as \( t_k \) approaches zero.

### Properties

1. **Non-emptiness**: If \( F(x) \) is non-empty and compact, \( DF(x; v) \) is non-empty for all \( v \in \mathbb{R}^n \).
2. **Convexity**: If \( F(x) \) is convex, \( DF(x; v) \) is also convex.
3. **Lipschitz Continuity**: If \( F \) is locally Lipschitz, the contingent derivative exists and provides a useful approximation for small perturbations.

### Example

Consider the set-valued map \( F: \mathbb{R} \to 2^{\mathbb{R}} \) given by:
$$
F(x) = 
\begin{cases}
[0, 1] & \text{if } x = 0, \\
\{x\} & \text{if } x \neq 0.
\end{cases}
$$
We want to find the contingent derivative at \( x = 0 \) in the direction \( v = 1 \).

1. For \( x \neq 0 \), \( F(x) = \{x\} \), so \( F(x + t) = \{x + t\} \).
2. At \( x = 0 \), \( F(0 + t) = \{t\} \).

Thus, for small \( t \), the contingent derivative is:
$$
DF(0; 1) = \left\{ \lim_{t_k \to 0} \frac{F(t_k) - F(0)}{t_k} \mid t_k \neq 0 \right\} = \left\{ \lim_{t_k \to 0} \frac{t_k - [0, 1]}{t_k} \right\} = [0, 1].
$$

### Applications

#### Optimization

In optimization, the contingent derivative helps in characterizing the behavior of set-valued constraints. It can be used to derive optimality conditions and to study sensitivity analysis.

#### Control Theory

In control theory, the contingent derivative is used to describe the evolution of systems with set-valued dynamics, particularly in the study of [[differential inclusions]].

#### Variational Analysis

The contingent derivative is fundamental in variational analysis, where it helps in understanding the stability and perturbations of optimization problems and variational inequalities.

### Important Results

#### Existence of Solutions to Differential Inclusions

The contingent derivative is crucial in proving the existence of solutions to [[differential inclusions]]. For a differential inclusion of the form:
$$
\dot{x}(t) \in F(t, x(t)),
$$
the contingent derivative provides a way to construct approximate solutions that converge to an actual solution.

### Conclusion

The contingent derivative is a powerful tool in set-valued analysis, providing a means to generalize the concept of differentiation to set-valued maps. Its properties and applications make it essential in optimization, control theory, and variational analysis. For further study, explore topics such as [[Nonsmooth Analysis]], [[Set-Valued Maps]], and [[Differential Inclusions]].
