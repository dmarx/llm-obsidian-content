cross-ratio


**ASSISTANT**

The **cross-ratio** is an important concept in [[projective geometry]], providing an invariant measure under projective transformations, such as homographies. This property is particularly useful because it remains constant even as the perspective changes, which is essential in applications involving cameras and optical systems.

### Definition

Given four collinear points \( A, B, C, D \) on a projective line, their cross-ratio \( (A, B; C, D) \) is defined as:
$$
(A, B; C, D) = \frac{AC \cdot BD}{AD \cdot BC}
$$
Here, \( AC, BD, AD, \) and \( BC \) represent the distances between the respective points. In a projective setting, these "distances" are not the usual Euclidean distances but rather are defined in terms of the homogeneous coordinates of the points.

### Homogeneous Coordinates Representation

If the points \( A, B, C, \) and \( D \) have homogeneous coordinates \( [a_1:a_2], [b_1:b_2], [c_1:c_2], [d_1:d_2] \) respectively, the cross-ratio can also be expressed as:
$$
(A, B; C, D) = \frac{(a_1c_2 - a_2c_1)(b_1d_2 - b_2d_1)}{(a_1d_2 - a_2d_1)(b_1c_2 - b_2c_1)}
$$
This formulation uses the determinants of the pairs of points to calculate the "distances", which in projective terms relate to the areas spanned by the point pairs.

### Properties of Cross-Ratio

1. **Invariance Under Projective Transformations**:
   - The most significant property of the cross-ratio is its invariance under projective transformations. No matter how the points \( A, B, C, \) and \( D \) are transformed by a projective map, their cross-ratio remains the same.

2. **Symmetry and Permutations**:
   - The cross-ratio is not symmetric in its arguments; that is, permuting the points generally changes the cross-ratio. However, there are specific symmetries, such as:
     $$
     (A, B; C, D) = (B, A; D, C) = \frac{1}{(A, B; D, C)} = \frac{1}{(C, D; A, B)}
     $$

3. **Applications in Quadrilaterals**:
   - When points \( A, B, C, \) and \( D \) form a complete quadrilateral with lines connecting non-adjacent points, the cross-ratios along these lines are related and can provide insights into the geometric properties of the configuration.

### Applications of Cross-Ratio

1. **Computer Vision**:
   - The constancy of the cross-ratio is used to compute distances and reconstruct scenes in computer vision applications, particularly when objects are viewed from different angles or through cameras with varying focal lengths.

2. **Photogrammetry**:
   - In photogrammetry, the cross-ratio helps in calibrating cameras and stitching together images taken from different viewpoints.

3. **Theoretical Physics**:
   - In physics, particularly in theories involving conformal and projective mappings, the cross-ratio is used to explore properties of spacetime and other constructs where transformations preserve angles and ratios rather than distances.

Understanding the cross-ratio deepens the comprehension of [[projective geometry]]'s fundamental nature and enhances the ability to apply these concepts across various scientific and engineering disciplines.
