**USER**

secondary deviance


**ASSISTANT**

**Secondary deviance** is a concept in labeling theory that refers to the deviant behavior that arises as a response to the societal reaction and labeling of an individual as deviant. This stage occurs when an individual internalizes the deviant label, which then influences their self-identity and leads to continued or escalated deviant behavior. Secondary deviance contrasts with primary deviance, which involves initial acts of deviance that do not affect an individual's self-concept or lead to a deviant identity.

## Key Aspects of Secondary Deviance

### Definition

Secondary deviance involves:
1. **Labeling**: The process by which society labels an individual as deviant based on their behavior.
2. **Internalization**: The individual accepts and internalizes the deviant label, incorporating it into their self-concept.
3. **Behavioral Continuation**: Continued or escalated deviant behavior as a result of the internalized label and altered self-identity.
4. **Social Consequences**: The societal reactions and sanctions that reinforce the deviant identity and behavior.

### Importance

- **Understanding Deviance**: Provides insight into how societal reactions and labeling contribute to the persistence of deviant behavior.
- **Policy and Rehabilitation**: Highlights the need for policies and rehabilitation approaches that avoid stigmatization and support positive identity formation.
- **Social Inequality**: Examines how power dynamics and social inequality influence the labeling process and its consequences.

## Theoretical Foundations

### 1. Edwin Lemert

#### Contributions

- **Primary and Secondary Deviance**: Lemert introduced the concepts of primary and secondary deviance to distinguish between initial acts of deviance and the deviant behavior that follows societal labeling.
- **Societal Reaction**: Emphasized the role of societal reaction in transforming primary deviance into secondary deviance.

#### Example

- **Juvenile Delinquency**: A teenager who commits a minor theft (primary deviance) may be labeled as a delinquent by the community. This label can lead to the teenager accepting this identity and engaging in more serious criminal behavior (secondary deviance).

### 2. Howard Becker

#### Contributions

- **Labeling Theory**: Becker's work on labeling theory further developed the ideas introduced by Lemert, focusing on the social processes and power dynamics involved in labeling.
- **Deviant Careers**: Discussed how individuals labeled as deviant might enter a "deviant career," where they adopt deviant roles and behaviors due to societal reactions.

#### Example

- **Drug Use**: A person labeled as a "drug addict" may find it difficult to find employment or social acceptance, leading to continued drug use and further entrenchment in deviant subcultures.

## Mechanisms of Secondary Deviance

### 1. Internalization of Labels

#### Identity Formation

- **Acceptance of Label**: The individual begins to see themselves through the lens of the deviant label.
- **Self-Fulfilling Prophecy**: The label influences the individual's behavior, leading them to act in ways that conform to the label.

#### Example

- **School Labeling**: A student labeled as a "troublemaker" may start to see themselves as inherently problematic, leading to continued disruptive behavior.

### 2. Social Exclusion

#### Stigmatization

- **Social Rejection**: Labeled individuals may face rejection and exclusion from mainstream social groups.
- **Subcultural Involvement**: As a result, they may turn to deviant subcultures that accept and reinforce their deviant identity.

#### Example

- **Criminal Subcultures**: Individuals labeled as criminals may find acceptance in gangs or criminal networks, which further reinforces their deviant behavior.

### 3. Institutional Responses

#### Formal Sanctions

- **Legal and Social Penalties**: Formal sanctions, such as arrest, imprisonment, or expulsion from school, reinforce the deviant label.
- **Cycle of Deviance**: These sanctions can create barriers to reintegration into conventional society, perpetuating the cycle of deviance.

#### Example

- **Reoffending**: Ex-offenders who struggle to find legitimate employment due to their criminal record may return to criminal activities, perpetuating secondary deviance.

## Case Studies Illustrating Secondary Deviance

### 1. The Saints and the Roughnecks (William Chambliss)

#### Issue

- **Youth Deviance**: Chambliss's study of two groups of high school boys, the "Saints" (middle-class) and the "Roughnecks" (working-class), who engaged in similar deviant behavior but were labeled differently by society.

#### Findings

- **Differential Labeling**: The Saints were labeled as good kids with occasional mischief, while the Roughnecks were labeled as troublemakers.
- **Secondary Deviance**: The Roughnecks' deviant behavior escalated due to societal labeling and limited opportunities, illustrating secondary deviance.

### 2. The Rosenhan Experiment (David Rosenhan)

#### Issue

- **Mental Health Diagnosis**: Rosenhan's experiment where healthy individuals were admitted to psychiatric hospitals after faking symptoms.

#### Findings

- **Labeling and Stigma**: Once labeled as mentally ill, their normal behaviors were interpreted as symptoms of their diagnosed conditions.
- **Impact on Identity**: The study highlighted how psychiatric labels can lead to self-fulfilling prophecies and reinforce deviant identities.

### 3. Juvenile Delinquency and School Expulsion

#### Issue

- **Educational Exclusion**: The impact of school expulsion on juvenile delinquency.

#### Findings

- **Reinforcement of Labels**: Expelled students often internalize the label of "delinquent" or "failure."
- **Increased Deviance**: Lack of access to education and support networks leads to increased involvement in criminal activities.

## Strategies for Addressing Secondary Deviance

### 1. Preventive Measures

#### Early Intervention

- **Support Programs**: Implementing programs that provide support and resources to at-risk individuals before they are labeled.
- **Positive Reinforcement**: Encouraging positive behavior and identity formation through mentorship and community programs.

#### Example

- **Youth Programs**: Community centers offering educational and recreational activities to keep at-risk youth engaged and away from deviant activities.

### 2. Rehabilitation and Reintegration

#### Restorative Justice

- **Focus on Rehabilitation**: Emphasizing rehabilitation over punishment to help individuals reintegrate into society.
- **Restorative Practices**: Using restorative justice practices that involve reconciliation between offenders and victims.

#### Example

- **Reentry Programs**: Providing job training, counseling, and support for ex-offenders to facilitate their reintegration and prevent recidivism.

### 3. Reducing Stigmatization

#### Public Education

- **Awareness Campaigns**: Conducting public education campaigns to reduce stigma associated with certain labels, such as mental illness or criminal records.
- **Advocacy**: Advocating for policies that promote understanding and acceptance of labeled individuals.

#### Example

- **Mental Health Campaigns**: National campaigns aimed at reducing the stigma of mental health issues and encouraging individuals to seek help without fear of labeling.

### 4. Policy Reforms

#### Legal and Social Policy

- **Decriminalization**: Reducing the criminalization of certain behaviors to prevent unnecessary labeling.
- **Supportive Legislation**: Enacting laws that support rehabilitation and reduce barriers to reintegration.

#### Example

- **Drug Policy Reforms**: Shifting from punitive approaches to treatment-focused approaches for drug offenses to reduce labeling and support recovery.

## Measuring Effectiveness

### Metrics

- **Recidivism Rates**: Tracking recidivism rates to assess the impact of interventions on reducing secondary deviance.
- **Educational Outcomes**: Measuring academic performance and behavioral outcomes in schools to evaluate the effectiveness of preventive programs.
- **Public Attitudes**: Assessing changes in public attitudes towards labeled individuals through surveys and public opinion polls.

### Tools

- **Longitudinal Studies**: Conducting longitudinal studies to track individuals over time and measure the long-term effects of interventions.
- **Survey Platforms**: Using tools like SurveyMonkey or Qualtrics to gather data on public attitudes and experiences with labeling.
- **Qualitative Research**: Employing qualitative methods, such as interviews and focus groups, to gain deeper insights into the experiences of labeled individuals.

### Conclusion

Secondary deviance highlights the powerful impact of societal reactions and labeling on individuals' behavior and identity. By understanding the processes that lead to secondary deviance, we can develop strategies to prevent and mitigate its effects. Implementing preventive measures, promoting rehabilitation and reintegration, reducing stigmatization, and enacting policy reforms are essential steps in addressing secondary deviance. Regular measurement and analysis of these efforts are crucial for advancing our understanding and improving social outcomes.
