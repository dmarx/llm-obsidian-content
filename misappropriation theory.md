# Misappropriation Theory

## Overview

[[Misappropriation theory]] is a legal doctrine primarily developed in the context of [[securities law]] that prohibits trading on [[material non-public information]] that has been obtained through a breach of duty or deception. Unlike the classical theory of [[insider trading]], which focuses on corporate insiders who breach fiduciary duties to shareholders, misappropriation theory extends liability to "outsiders" who trade based on confidential information they have misappropriated from the source of that information.

## Mathematical Formulation

Let us define a mathematical framework for analyzing misappropriation:

Let $I$ represent an information set where:
- $I_{pub}$ represents publicly available information
- $I_{priv}$ represents private information
- $I_{mat} \subset I_{priv}$ represents [[material non-public information]]

Define an agent $A$ who possesses some information set $I_A$ and a source $S$ who possesses information set $I_S$ where $I_S \cap I_{mat} \neq \emptyset$.

A [[duty relationship]] $D(A,S)$ exists between $A$ and $S$ if $A$ has an obligation to maintain the confidentiality of $I_S \cap I_{mat}$.

[[Misappropriation]] occurs when:
1. $A$ obtains information $i \in I_S \cap I_{mat}$
2. $D(A,S)$ exists
3. $A$ uses $i$ for trading purposes without authorization from $S$

## Legal Elements

The essential elements of misappropriation theory include:

1. **[[Fiduciary duty]] or duty of trust and confidence**: The information must be obtained through a relationship where there is a duty to keep the information confidential.

2. **[[Material non-public information]]**: The information must be both:
   - Material: $\exists i \in I_{mat}$ such that the expected value of a security conditional on $i$ differs from its expected value conditional on $I_{pub}$: $E[P|i] \neq E[P|I_{pub}]$
   - Non-public: $i \notin I_{pub}$

3. **[[Deceptive conduct]]**: The misappropriation involves some form of deception toward the source of the information.

4. **[[Scienter]]**: The defendant must have acted with intent or severe recklessness.

## Development in Case Law

### United States v. O'Hagan (1997)

The [[misappropriation theory]] was formally adopted by the U.S. Supreme Court in United States v. O'Hagan. James O'Hagan was a partner at a law firm representing Grand Metropolitan in its planned tender offer for Pillsbury Company. Although O'Hagan did not work directly on the matter, he learned of the planned acquisition and purchased Pillsbury options and shares before the public announcement. After the announcement, he sold his positions for a profit of over $4.3 million.

The Court held that:

1. O'Hagan engaged in deception by pretending to serve the interests of his firm and its client while secretly converting the information for his personal gain.
2. This deception was "in connection with" securities transactions, as required by Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act.
3. The misappropriation theory protects market integrity by prohibiting trading based on misappropriated confidential information.

### Formal Representation

O'Hagan's case can be formally represented as:
- $A$ = O'Hagan
- $S$ = Law firm and its client (Grand Metropolitan)
- $i$ = Information about planned tender offer for Pillsbury
- $D(A,S)$ = Duty of confidentiality owed by O'Hagan to his firm and the firm's client
- $i \in I_S \cap I_{mat}$ (Material non-public information possessed by the source)
- O'Hagan's trading constituted misappropriation because he used $i$ for trading without authorization while $D(A,S)$ existed

## Relationship to Classical Insider Trading Theory

Classical insider trading theory establishes a [[disclose or abstain]] rule for corporate insiders based on their fiduciary duties to shareholders. If we define:

- $C$ as a corporation
- $SH$ as the set of shareholders of $C$
- $I$ as a corporate insider with information set $I_I$

Then under classical theory, insider trading occurs when:
1. $I$ possesses information $i \in I_I \cap I_{mat}$
2. $D(I,SH)$ exists (fiduciary duty to shareholders)
3. $I$ trades without disclosing $i$ to $SH$

Misappropriation theory extends this framework to cases where:
1. The trader is not necessarily a corporate insider
2. The duty breached is to the source of information, not to the shareholders of the traded company

## Symbolic Model of Information Flow and Liability

We can model information flow and liability using a directed graph $G = (V, E)$ where:
- $V$ is the set of agents (individuals, entities)
- $E$ is the set of directed edges representing information flow or duty relationships

For each edge $(u, v) \in E$, we can define:
- $I_{u \rightarrow v}$ as the information transmitted from $u$ to $v$
- $D(u, v)$ as a binary variable indicating whether a duty relationship exists

[[Misappropriation liability]] exists for agent $v$ if:
1. $\exists u \in V$ such that $(u, v) \in E$
2. $I_{u \rightarrow v} \cap I_{mat} \neq \emptyset$
3. $D(u, v) = 1$
4. $v$ trades based on $I_{u \rightarrow v} \cap I_{mat}$ without authorization

## Important SEC Rules

### Rule 10b5-1

SEC Rule 10b5-1 provides that trading "on the basis of" material non-public information occurs when the person trading was aware of the information when making the trade. This creates a [[possession vs. use]] distinction in misappropriation cases.

If we define:
- $K_A(i)$ as a binary variable indicating awareness of information $i$ by agent $A$
- $T_A(i)$ as a binary variable indicating trading by $A$ while $K_A(i) = 1$

Then under Rule 10b5-1, liability exists when:
1. $i \in I_{mat}$
2. $K_A(i) = 1$
3. $T_A(i) = 1$
4. No affirmative defense applies

### Rule 10b5-2

SEC Rule 10b5-2 clarifies when a "duty of trust or confidence" exists in misappropriation cases, specifying three non-exclusive bases:

1. Agreement to maintain confidence
2. Pattern/practice of sharing confidences creating reasonable expectation of confidentiality
3. Information received from spouse, parent, child, or sibling (rebuttable presumption)

Formally, $D(A,S) = 1$ if any of these conditions are met.

## Theoretical Implications

The misappropriation theory has several important theoretical implications:

### Information Asymmetry Model

In efficient markets, prices reflect all available public information. If we define:
- $P$ as the price of a security
- $I_{pub}$ as the set of public information
- $I_{all}$ as the set of all information (public and private)

Then:
- In semi-strong efficiency: $P = f(I_{pub})$
- With misappropriation: $P_{misapp} = f(I_{pub} \cup I_{misapp})$ where $I_{misapp} \subset I_{priv}$

The difference $P_{misapp} - P$ represents the unfair advantage gained through misappropriation.

### Game-Theoretic Approach

Misappropriation can be modeled as a [[sequential game]] where:
1. Nature determines whether agent $A$ receives material non-public information
2. $A$ decides whether to trade based on this information
3. Regulators decide whether to investigate and prosecute

The expected utility for $A$ is:
$E[U_A] = (1-p) \cdot G + p \cdot (G - F)$

Where:
- $G$ is the gain from trading
- $p$ is the probability of detection and successful prosecution
- $F$ is the penalty if caught

Deterrence occurs when $E[U_A] < 0$, which requires $p \cdot F > G$.

## Philosophical Considerations

The misappropriation theory embodies several philosophical principles:

1. **[[Property rights in information]]**: The theory treats confidential information as a form of property that can be misappropriated.

2. **[[Market integrity]]**: By prohibiting trading on misappropriated information, the theory aims to maintain fairness and integrity in securities markets.

3. **[[Deontological ethics]]**: The theory emphasizes the wrongness of deceptive conduct regardless of consequences.

4. **[[Consequentialist considerations]]**: The theory also considers the harmful effects of information asymmetry on market efficiency and investor confidence.

## Limitations and Criticisms

1. **[[Boundary problem]]**: Difficulty in drawing clear lines between legitimate research-based trading and misappropriation.

2. **[[Over-deterrence]]**: Potential to discourage legitimate information gathering and analysis that contributes to market efficiency.

3. **[[Under-inclusiveness]]**: Some forms of informational advantages may remain outside the scope of the theory.

4. **[[Enforcement challenges]]**: Practical difficulties in detecting and proving misappropriation cases.
