### Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)

**Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)** is a type of industrial control system (ICS) used for high-level supervision of machines and processes. SCADA systems are designed to collect real-time data from remote locations and provide centralized monitoring and control capabilities for industrial processes. They are widely used in a variety of industries, including manufacturing, energy (oil and gas, electricity generation and distribution), water and wastewater, transportation, and building automation.

### Components of SCADA Systems

A typical SCADA system comprises several key components that work together to monitor and control industrial processes:

1. **Field Devices**:
   - **Sensors**: These devices collect data from the environment, such as temperature, pressure, flow rate, and level. Sensors convert physical quantities into electrical signals that can be read by other devices in the SCADA system.
   - **Actuators**: Actuators execute control commands received from the SCADA system. They can operate valves, motors, or other equipment to perform specific actions based on the data collected by sensors.

2. **Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) and Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs)**:
   - **Remote Terminal Units (RTUs)**: RTUs are microprocessor-based devices located in remote sites, which collect data from field devices and transmit it back to the central SCADA system. They also receive control commands from the central system and execute them locally.
   - **Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs)**: PLCs are more advanced and flexible controllers used in industrial settings. They can perform local control actions independently and are often used in place of RTUs due to their robustness and versatility in executing complex control logic.

3. **Communication Network**:
   - The communication network connects the field devices, RTUs, PLCs, and the central SCADA servers. This network can use various communication protocols, such as Ethernet, Modbus, DNP3, and IEC 60870-5-104, depending on the application and infrastructure. The network ensures reliable and secure data transfer between all components of the SCADA system.

4. **SCADA Master Stations (HMI/SCADA Servers)**:
   - The master stations are central control and monitoring servers that receive data from the field devices and display it to human operators via [[Human-Machine Interface (HMI)|HMIs]]. SCADA servers process data, store historical data, and run applications for analytics, reporting, and alarming. They are also responsible for sending control commands to the RTUs and PLCs based on pre-programmed logic or manual input from operators.

5. **Human-Machine Interface (HMI)**:
   - The HMI is the graphical user interface (GUI) that allows human operators to interact with the SCADA system. HMIs display real-time data, trends, alarms, and historical data, providing operators with insights into the status and performance of the controlled processes. Operators can also use the HMI to issue commands to the system, such as opening or closing valves or starting or stopping motors.

2. **Data Communication**:
   - The data collected by field devices is transmitted to the central SCADA servers via a communication network. This data transfer must be reliable and secure to ensure the integrity and availability of the system.

3. **Data Processing and Visualization**:
   - SCADA systems process the collected data to derive meaningful information and visualize it on the HMI screens. This includes real-time data display, trend analysis, and generating alarms if the data indicates abnormal conditions or thresholds being exceeded.

4. **Control and Automation**:
   - SCADA systems allow for both automatic and manual control of industrial processes. Automated control actions can be programmed based on logic, such as opening a valve if a tank reaches a certain level. Operators can also manually control devices through the HMI when necessary.

5. **Alarm Management**:
   - When the SCADA system detects an abnormal condition, such as a parameter exceeding a predefined threshold, it triggers an alarm. The alarm management function prioritizes alarms, alerts operators, and logs the events for analysis and compliance.

6. **Data Archiving and Reporting**:
   - SCADA systems store historical data for analysis, reporting, and compliance purposes. This archived data can be used to identify trends, optimize processes, and perform predictive maintenance.
