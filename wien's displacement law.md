Wien's Displacement Law


**ASSISTANT**

**Wien's Displacement Law** describes the relationship between the temperature of a blackbody and the wavelength at which it emits radiation most intensely. Specifically, the law states that as the temperature of a blackbody increases, the peak wavelength of the emitted radiation shifts to shorter wavelengths.

### Mathematical Formulation

Wien's Displacement Law gives the wavelength $\lambda_{\text{max}}$ at which the [[spectral energy density]] of a blackbody radiation curve is maximized for a given temperature $T$:

$$ \lambda_{\text{max}} T = b $$

where:
- $\lambda_{\text{max}}$ is the wavelength at which the blackbody radiation is most intense,
- $T$ is the absolute temperature of the blackbody (in kelvins),
- $b$ is **Wien's displacement constant**, with the value:
  
  $$ b \approx 2.898 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m} \cdot \text{K} $$

### Physical Meaning

Wien's law shows that as the temperature of a blackbody increases:
- The peak of the emission spectrum shifts to shorter wavelengths (higher frequencies).
- Hotter objects emit radiation that is more intense and shifts towards the blue end of the spectrum (e.g., a star radiating more blue light as it heats up).

Conversely, cooler objects emit radiation at longer wavelengths (infrared or redder light).

For example:
- The Sun, with a surface temperature of about 5778 K, emits most of its radiation in the visible spectrum, with a peak wavelength around 500 nm (green light).
- The cosmic microwave background radiation, at a temperature of 2.725 K, has a peak wavelength of about 1.9 mm (microwave region).

### Derivation from Planck's Law

Wien's Displacement Law can be derived from **Planck’s Law**, which describes the [[spectral energy density]] $u(\lambda, T)$ of blackbody radiation as a function of wavelength $\lambda$ and temperature $T$:

$$ u(\lambda, T) = \frac{8 \pi h c}{\lambda^5} \frac{1}{e^{\frac{hc}{\lambda k_B T}} - 1} $$

To find the peak of the distribution, one can differentiate $u(\lambda, T)$ with respect to $\lambda$ and set the derivative equal to zero:

$$ \frac{d}{d\lambda} u(\lambda, T) = 0 $$

This leads to the transcendental equation:

$$ \frac{hc}{\lambda_{\text{max}} k_B T} = 5 + e^{-\frac{hc}{\lambda_{\text{max}} k_B T}} $$

Numerically solving this equation gives the constant $b = \frac{hc}{k_B} \cdot 1/(4.9651)$, which results in the value of $b \approx 2.898 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m} \cdot \text{K}$.

### Application of Wien's Displacement Law

Wien's Displacement Law is useful for estimating the temperature of objects based on the peak wavelength of the radiation they emit. Some applications include:

1. **Astrophysics**: By observing the spectrum of a star, Wien's law helps determine the star’s surface temperature based on the peak wavelength of its emitted radiation.
  
2. **Thermal Imaging**: Infrared cameras use Wien's law to estimate the temperature of objects by measuring the peak wavelength of emitted infrared radiation.
  
3. **Cosmology**: The law is applied to analyze the cosmic microwave background radiation, where the peak wavelength indicates a temperature of about 2.725 K.

### Summary

**Wien's Displacement Law** shows that the peak wavelength of blackbody radiation is inversely proportional to the temperature of the blackbody. As temperature increases, the peak of the blackbody spectrum shifts to shorter wavelengths. The law is crucial for understanding radiation from stars, planets, and other astronomical bodies, and it provides insight into how objects emit radiation based on their temperature.
