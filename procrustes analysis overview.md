### Procrustes Analysis Overview

[[Procrustes analysis]] is a form of statistical shape analysis used to determine the degree of similarity between shapes. This method is especially useful in the fields of biology, image analysis, and linguistics, where it is employed to analyze the variations in biological organisms, compare different shapes, or align images.

### Mathematical Formulation

#### General Concept

Procrustes analysis aims to align two datasets (shapes) by translating, scaling, and rotating them in a way that the distance between corresponding points in the datasets is minimized. The most common formulation of Procrustes analysis deals with shapes represented as sets of landmark points in Euclidean space, typically $R^k$.

#### Formulation of the Problem

Consider two sets of points, $X$ and $Y$, each containing $n$ points in $k$ dimensions. The matrices $X$ and $Y$ are $n \times k$ matrices. The goal is to find a translation vector $t$, a scaling factor $s$, and an orthogonal rotation matrix $R$ such that the Procrustes distance between $X$ and the transformed $Y$ is minimized. The Procrustes distance $d_P$ can be expressed as:

$$d_P(X, Y) = \min_{t, s, R} \|X - (sYR + t)\|_F$$

where $\|\cdot\|_F$ denotes the Frobenius norm.

#### Solving the Problem

1. **Centering**: Translate both $X$ and $Y$ so that their centroids are at the origin.
   
   $$X \leftarrow X - \bar{X}$$
   $$Y \leftarrow Y - \bar{Y}$$
   
   where $\bar{X}$ and $\bar{Y}$ are the mean rows of $X$ and $Y$, respectively.

2. **Scaling**: Normalize $Y$ so that the scale matches $X$. This can be done by adjusting $Y$ such that:

   $$s = \frac{\|X\|_F}{\|Y\|_F}$$
   $$Y \leftarrow sY$$

3. **Optimal Rotation**: Compute the singular value decomposition (SVD) of $X^T Y$ to find the optimal rotation matrix $R$.

   $$X^T Y = U \Sigma V^T$$
   $$R = UV^T$$

After applying these transformations, $Y$ is optimally aligned with $X$ under the chosen criteria.

### Applications and Extensions

- **Biometric Morphometrics**: Analyzing biological shapes and their variations.
- **Image Registration**: Aligning images in pre-processing steps for medical or satellite imagery.
- **Multivariate Statistics**: As part of more complex statistical procedures to analyze shape differences.

### Advanced Extensions

1. **Generalized Procrustes Analysis (GPA)**: An extension of Procrustes analysis that deals with more than two shapes to find a consensus shape.
2. **Partial Procrustes Analysis**: Used when only a subset of landmark points are to be considered in the analysis.

Each of these extensions adapts the basic principles of Procrustes analysis to suit specific problems and datasets, enhancing its versatility in research and application.
