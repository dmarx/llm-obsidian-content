**ASSISTANT**

The **IKEA effect** is a cognitive bias in which consumers place a disproportionately high value on products they partially create. This phenomenon is named after the Swedish furniture retailer IKEA, whose products typically require assembly by the customer. The IKEA effect implies that people assign higher value to items they have worked on themselves, compared to similar items completed by others.

### Key Aspects of the IKEA Effect

1. **Effort Justification**:
   - The effort put into creating or assembling something increases the perceived value of the product.
   - This can be related to the psychological concept of **cognitive dissonance**, where people adjust their attitudes to align with their actions and efforts.

2. **Endowment Effect**:
   - The IKEA effect can be considered a specific instance of the [[Endowment Effect|endowment effect]], where ownership increases the perceived value of an item.
   - Here, the "ownership" extends to the effort and time invested in creating the product.

3. **Labor and Love**:
   - The effect suggests that labor leads to love. People tend to value their own creations more highly, not only because of the final product but also because of the process and effort involved in creating it.

### Experimental Evidence

A seminal paper by Michael I. Norton, Daniel Mochon, and Dan Ariely provides empirical evidence for the IKEA effect. In their experiments, participants were asked to assemble IKEA boxes, origami projects, and Lego sets. The findings indicated that participants were willing to pay more for items they had assembled themselves compared to identical items assembled by others.

### Formalization

We can formalize the IKEA effect through a utility function that incorporates effort:

$$ U(x) = v(x) + \beta e(x) $$

where:
- \( U(x) \) is the total utility derived from the product \( x \).
- \( v(x) \) is the intrinsic value of the product.
- \( e(x) \) represents the effort exerted in creating or assembling the product.
- \( \beta \) is a positive coefficient representing the weight of the effort on the perceived value.

### Applications and Implications

- **Marketing and Product Design**:
  - Companies can leverage the IKEA effect by offering products that require customer assembly or customization.
  - This can lead to increased customer satisfaction and willingness to pay a premium.

- **Consumer Behavior**:
  - Understanding the IKEA effect helps in predicting consumer preferences and behaviors, especially in DIY and customizable product markets.

- **Behavioral Economics**:
  - The IKEA effect highlights the importance of psychological factors in economic decisions, challenging traditional models that assume purely rational behavior.

### Related Concepts

- **[[Effort Justification]]**: The tendency to assign greater value to outcomes that required more effort to achieve.
- **[[Cognitive Dissonance]]**: The mental discomfort experienced by a person who holds two or more contradictory beliefs or values.
- **[[Endowment Effect]]**: The phenomenon where people ascribe more value to things merely because they own them.

By understanding and incorporating the IKEA effect into various domains, businesses and researchers can better predict and influence consumer behavior, leading to more effective marketing strategies and product designs.
