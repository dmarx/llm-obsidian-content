Homotopy is a central concept in topology, a branch of mathematics concerned with the properties of space that are preserved under continuous transformations. Homotopy provides a way to classify and study the equivalence of maps between topological spaces, capturing the idea of one map being continuously deformed into another. This concept is foundational not only in topology but also in fields that rely on topological ideas, such as [[algebraic topology]], differential geometry, and theoretical physics.

### Definition

Formally, a homotopy between two continuous functions $f, g: X \to Y$, where $X$ and $Y$ are topological spaces, is a continuous function $H: X \times [0, 1] \to Y$ such that:
- For every $x \in X$, $H(x, 0) = f(x)$.
- For every $x \in X$, $H(x, 1) = g(x)$.

The function $H$ is often thought of as a "continuous deformation" of $f$ into $g$, with the parameter $t \in [0, 1]$ representing time. If such a homotopy $H$ exists, $f$ and $g$ are said to be homotopic, denoted as $f \simeq g$.

### Homotopy Equivalence

Two topological spaces $X$ and $Y$ are called **homotopy equivalent** or of the same **homotopy type** if there exist continuous maps $f: X \to Y$ and $g: Y \to X$ such that $g \circ f$ is homotopic to the identity map on $X$ and $f \circ g$ is homotopic to the identity map on $Y$. Homotopy equivalence is a broader notion than homeomorphism (exact topological equivalence), capturing a more flexible notion of "sameness" between spaces that allows for stretching and shrinking but not tearing or gluing.

### Fundamental Group and Higher Homotopy Groups

Homotopy theory introduces the concept of the **fundamental group** $\pi_1(X, x_0)$ of a space $X$ at a point $x_0$, which captures information
