# Mori-Zwanzig Formalism

The Mori-Zwanzig formalism is a rigorous mathematical framework in [[statistical mechanics]] that enables the systematic derivation of reduced-order models for complex dynamical systems. Developed by [[Hazime Mori]] and [[Robert Zwanzig]] in the 1960s, this approach provides a formal solution to the fundamental problem of bridging microscopic and macroscopic descriptions of physical systems by systematically eliminating [[fast degrees of freedom]] while retaining their effects on the dynamics of the [[slow degrees of freedom]].

## Theoretical Foundation

### Projection Operator Approach

The core of the Mori-Zwanzig formalism lies in the use of [[projection operators]] that separate relevant (resolved) dynamics from irrelevant (unresolved) dynamics:

$$\mathcal{P}f = \sum_i \langle f, g_i \rangle g_i$$

Where:
- $\mathcal{P}$ is the projection operator onto the space of relevant variables
- $\{g_i\}$ forms a basis for the space of relevant variables
- $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle$ denotes an appropriate inner product

The complementary projection operator $\mathcal{Q} = \mathcal{I} - \mathcal{P}$ projects onto the space of irrelevant variables.

### Liouville Equation Framework

For a Hamiltonian system, the evolution of an observable $A(z)$ is governed by the [[Liouville equation]]:

$$\frac{\partial}{\partial t}A(z,t) = \{A(z,t), H(z)\} = i\mathcal{L}A(z,t)$$

Where:
- $\{·,·\}$ denotes the [[Poisson bracket]]
- $\mathcal{L}$ is the [[Liouville operator]] defined as $i\mathcal{L} = \{·, H\}$
- $H(z)$ is the Hamiltonian of the system
- $z$ represents the phase space coordinates

The formal solution is:

$$A(z,t) = e^{i\mathcal{L}t}A(z,0)$$

### The Dyson Formula

Using the identity $e^{i\mathcal{L}t} = e^{i\mathcal{QL}t} + \int_0^t ds\, e^{i\mathcal{L}(t-s)}\mathcal{P}i\mathcal{L}e^{i\mathcal{QL}s}$, the evolution can be rewritten as:

$$\frac{d}{dt}\mathcal{P}A(t) = \mathcal{P}\mathcal{L}\mathcal{P}A(t) + \mathcal{P}\mathcal{L}e^{\mathcal{QL}t}\mathcal{Q}A(0) + \int_0^t \mathcal{P}\mathcal{L}e^{\mathcal{QL}(t-s)}\mathcal{QL}\mathcal{P}A(s)\,ds$$

This is the [[Mori-Zwanzig identity]], which decomposes the dynamics into three terms:

1. **[[Markovian term]]**: $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{L}\mathcal{P}A(t)$ - represents the direct effect of resolved variables on themselves
2. **[[Noise term]]**: $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{L}e^{\mathcal{QL}t}\mathcal{Q}A(0)$ - represents the influence of initial conditions in the unresolved variables
3. **[[Memory term]]**: $\int_0^t \mathcal{P}\mathcal{L}e^{\mathcal{QL}(t-s)}\mathcal{QL}\mathcal{P}A(s)\,ds$ - accounts for history-dependent effects of the unresolved variables on the resolved ones

## Mathematical Structure

### Generalized Langevin Equation

For linear projections, the Mori-Zwanzig identity leads to the [[Generalized Langevin Equation]] (GLE):

$$\frac{d\mathbf{x}}{dt} = \mathbf{\Omega} \cdot \mathbf{x}(t) + \int_0^t \mathbf{K}(t-s) \cdot \mathbf{x}(s)\,ds + \mathbf{F}(t)$$

Where:
- $\mathbf{x}(t)$ represents the vector of relevant variables
- $\mathbf{\Omega}$ is the [[frequency matrix]] (Markovian term)
- $\mathbf{K}(t)$ is the [[memory kernel]] (memory term)
- $\mathbf{F}(t)$ is the [[fluctuating force]] (noise term), which is orthogonal to the projected space

### Memory Kernel

The memory kernel $\mathbf{K}(t)$ captures the influence of past states on the current dynamics:

$$\mathbf{K}(t) = \langle \mathbf{F}(t), \mathbf{F}(0) \rangle \cdot \langle \mathbf{x}(0), \mathbf{x}(0) \rangle^{-1}$$

Where $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle$ denotes the [[correlation function]] with respect to the equilibrium ensemble.

### Fluctuation-Dissipation Relation

The [[fluctuation-dissipation theorem]] relates the memory kernel and the fluctuating force:

$$\langle \mathbf{F}(t) \mathbf{F}(0)^T \rangle = k_B T \mathbf{K}(t)$$

This relation ensures that the reduced dynamics maintains thermodynamic consistency with the full system.

## Practical Applications

### Projection Choices

Different projection operators lead to different reduced models:

1. **[[Linear projections]]**: Project onto a linear space of observables, leading to GLEs
2. **[[Conditional expectations]]**: Project onto the space of functions of selected variables
3. **[[Zwanzig projection]]**: $\mathcal{P}f = \langle f \rangle_{\mathcal{Q}}$, the average of $f$ over the unresolved variables
4. **[[Mori projection]]**: $\mathcal{P}f = \sum_i \frac{\langle f, A_i \rangle}{\langle A_i, A_i \rangle} A_i$, a projection onto a set of chosen observables

### Approximation Strategies

Several approximation strategies exist for the memory term:

1. **[[Markovian approximation]]**: Replace the memory term with an effective friction term
2. **[[Memory kernel expansion]]**: Approximate the memory kernel using a series of exponentials or other basis functions
3. **[[Time scale separation]]**: Exploit separation of time scales to simplify the memory effects
4. **[[Extended phase space methods]]**: Introduce auxiliary variables to capture memory effects

## Applications in Physics and Chemistry

### Brownian Motion

The classical application of the Mori-Zwanzig formalism is to [[Brownian motion]], deriving the [[Langevin equation]] from microscopic dynamics:

$$m\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -\gamma \frac{dx}{dt} + F_{\text{random}}(t)$$

The formalism shows how the friction coefficient $\gamma$ emerges from the memory kernel, and how the random force relates to the microscopic dynamics of the bath particles.

### Molecular Dynamics

In [[molecular dynamics]], the formalism enables:

1. **[[Coarse-graining]]**: Deriving effective equations for collective variables
2. **[[Reaction coordinates]]**: Identifying appropriate variables for describing rare events
3. **[[Implicit solvent models]]**: Incorporating solvent effects without explicit solvent molecules
4. **[[Non-Markovian effects]]**: Capturing memory effects in biomolecular systems

# Mori-Zwanzig Formalism

The [[Mori-Zwanzig formalism]] provides a mathematical framework for systematically deriving reduced models of complex dynamical systems. It bridges the gap between [[microscopic dynamics]] and [[macroscopic behavior]] by rigorously accounting for the influence of [[eliminated degrees of freedom]].

## Mathematical Formulation

Consider a dynamical system described by the ordinary differential equation:

$$\frac{d\mathbf{x}}{dt} = \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{x})$$

where $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ represents the full state of the system and $\mathbf{F}: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ is a (potentially nonlinear) function describing the dynamics.

The [[Koopman operator]] $\mathcal{K}$ describes the evolution of observables along trajectories of this system:

$$\mathcal{K} g(\mathbf{x}) = g(\mathbf{x}(t))$$

for any function $g: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. The infinitesimal generator of the Koopman operator, denoted $\mathcal{L}$, is given by:

$$\mathcal{L} = \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{x}) \cdot \nabla_{\mathbf{x}}$$

This operator, called the [[Liouville operator]], satisfies $\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\mathcal{K} = \mathcal{L}\mathcal{K}$.

In the MZ formalism, we decompose the phase space into "resolved" variables $\mathbf{z} \in \mathbb{R}^m$ (where $m < n$) and "unresolved" variables. This is achieved mathematically through a [[projection operator]] $\mathcal{P}$.

Let $\mathcal{P}$ be a projection operator that maps functions of the full state onto functions of only the resolved variables. The complementary projection is $\mathcal{Q} = \mathcal{I} - \mathcal{P}$, where $\mathcal{I}$ is the identity operator.

The exact [[Mori-Zwanzig equation]] for the evolution of an observable $g(\mathbf{z})$ is:

$$\frac{\partial}{\partial t}g(\mathbf{z}(t)) = \mathcal{P}\mathcal{L}g(\mathbf{z}(t)) + \int_0^t \mathcal{P}\mathcal{L}e^{(t-s)\mathcal{Q}\mathcal{L}}\mathcal{Q}\mathcal{L}g(\mathbf{z}(s))ds + e^{t\mathcal{Q}\mathcal{L}}\mathcal{Q}\mathcal{L}g(\mathbf{z}(0))$$

This equation decomposes the dynamics into three terms:
1. **Markovian term**: $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{L}g(\mathbf{z}(t))$ - representing the direct effect of the resolved variables
2. **Memory term**: $\int_0^t \mathcal{P}\mathcal{L}e^{(t-s)\mathcal{Q}\mathcal{L}}\mathcal{Q}\mathcal{L}g(\mathbf{z}(s))ds$ - capturing history-dependent effects
3. **Noise term**: $e^{t\mathcal{Q}\mathcal{L}}\mathcal{Q}\mathcal{L}g(\mathbf{z}(0))$ - representing influences from initial conditions in the unresolved variables

## Common Projection Operators

Different choices of projection operator $\mathcal{P}$ lead to different formulations:

1. **[[Mori Projection]]**: A linear projection based on inner products:
   $$\mathcal{P}f = \sum_i \frac{\langle f, u_i \rangle}{\langle u_i, u_i \rangle} u_i$$
   where $\{u_i\}$ is a set of basis functions for the resolved variables.

2. **[[Zwanzig Projection]]**: A conditional expectation with respect to a given probability measure $\mu$:
   $$\mathcal{P}f(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbb{E}_{\mu}[f(\mathbf{x}) | \mathbf{z}]$$

## Applications

The MZ formalism finds applications in:

- [[Molecular dynamics]] - deriving [[Generalized Langevin Equations]] for coarse-grained models
- [[Climate modeling]] - parameterizing subgrid processes
- [[Turbulence modeling]] - developing [[Large Eddy Simulation]] closures
- [[Statistical mechanics]] - connecting microscopic and macroscopic descriptions

## Computational Methods

Computing the memory kernel explicitly is often challenging. Several approaches exist:

1. **[[Memory Approximation Methods]]**:
   - [[Markovian approximation]]: Neglecting the memory term entirely
   - [[Short memory approximation]]: Truncating the time integration
   - [[Rational approximation]]: Using Padé approximants or continued fractions

2. **[[Data-driven Approaches]]**:
   - [[Nonlinear autoregressive models]]
   - [[Equation-free methods]]
   - [[Reservoir computing]]
   - [[Memory integral reconstruction]]

## Connection to Related Formalisms

The MZ formalism connects to several related mathematical frameworks:

- [[Nakajima-Zwanzig equation]] - A quantum mechanical analog
- [[Projection operator techniques]] in [[statistical physics]]
- [[Generalized Master Equations]]
- [[Fokker-Planck equations]]
- [[Langevin dynamics]]

## Mathematical Properties

Several important mathematical properties characterize the MZ formalism:

- The memory kernel exhibits [[fluctuation-dissipation relations]]
- The projection operator satisfies: $\mathcal{P}^2 = \mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{Q} = \mathcal{Q}\mathcal{P} = 0$
- The [[orthogonal dynamics operator]] $e^{t\mathcal{Q}\mathcal{L}}$ evolves in the orthogonal subspace

## Recent Developments

Recent advances in the MZ formalism include:

- [[Nonlinear projection operators]] for improved representation of complex relationships
- [[Data-driven MZ]] approaches using [[machine learning]]
- Extensions to [[stochastic systems]] and [[partial differential equations]]
- [[Time-dependent projection operators]] that adapt based on the evolving state

The MZ formalism provides a rigorous foundation for [[model reduction]], [[multiscale modeling]], and understanding how [[microscopic dynamics]] give rise to [[emergent macroscopic phenomena]].
