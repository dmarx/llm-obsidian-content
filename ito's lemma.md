### Ito's Lemma

**Ito's Lemma** is a fundamental result in stochastic calculus that provides the differential of a function of a stochastic process. It is a key tool for modeling and analyzing the dynamics of financial instruments, particularly in the context of continuous-time finance.

### Statement of Ito's Lemma

Let \( X_t \) be an Itô process, described by the stochastic differential equation (SDE):

$$
dX_t = \mu(X_t, t) dt + \sigma(X_t, t) dW_t
$$

where:
- \( \mu(X_t, t) \) is the drift term.
- \( \sigma(X_t, t) \) is the diffusion term.
- \( W_t \) is a Wiener process (or Brownian motion).

If \( f(X_t, t) \) is a twice continuously differentiable function of \( X_t \) and \( t \), then \( f(X_t, t) \) is also an Itô process, and its differential is given by Ito's Lemma:

$$
df(X_t, t) = \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial t} + \mu \frac{\partial f}{\partial X} + \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial X^2} \right) dt + \sigma \frac{\partial f}{\partial X} dW_t
$$

### Interpretation

Ito's Lemma can be viewed as the stochastic counterpart of the chain rule in classical calculus. It accounts for both the drift and the diffusion components of the underlying stochastic process.

### Derivation

For a function \( f(X_t, t) \), consider the Taylor series expansion up to the second order:

$$
df(X_t, t) \approx \frac{\partial f}{\partial t} dt + \frac{\partial f}{\partial X} dX_t + \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial X^2} (dX_t)^2
$$

Using the properties of stochastic calculus:
- \( (dt)^2 = 0 \)
- \( dt \cdot dW_t = 0 \)
- \( (dW_t)^2 = dt \)

The differential \( dX_t \) is given by the SDE:

$$
dX_t = \mu(X_t, t) dt + \sigma(X_t, t) dW_t
$$

Substitute \( dX_t \) and \( (dX_t)^2 \) into the Taylor expansion:

$$
(df)_t = \frac{\partial f}{\partial t} dt + \frac{\partial f}{\partial X} (\mu dt + \sigma dW_t) + \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial X^2} (\sigma dW_t)^2
$$

Simplify using \( (dW_t)^2 = dt \):

$$
df(X_t, t) = \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial t} + \mu \frac{\partial f}{\partial X} + \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial X^2} \right) dt + \sigma \frac{\partial f}{\partial X} dW_t
$$

### Example: Geometric Brownian Motion

Consider a geometric Brownian motion (GBM), which is commonly used to model stock prices:

$$
dS_t = \mu S_t dt + \sigma S_t dW_t
$$

Let \( f(S_t) = \ln(S_t) \). Applying Ito's Lemma:

1. Compute the partial derivatives:
   \[
   \frac{\partial f}{\partial S} = \frac{1}{S}, \quad \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial S^2} = -\frac{1}{S^2}
   \]

2. Apply Ito's Lemma:
   \[
   df(S_t) = \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial t} + \mu S_t \frac{\partial f}{\partial S} + \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 S_t^2 \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial S^2} \right) dt + \sigma S_t \frac{\partial f}{\partial S} dW_t
   \]

3. Substitute the derivatives and simplify:
   \[
   df(S_t) = \left( 0 + \mu S_t \cdot \frac{1}{S_t} + \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 S_t^2 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{S_t^2}\right) \right) dt + \sigma S_t \cdot \frac{1}{S_t} dW_t
   \]
   \[
   df(S_t) = \left( \mu - \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 \right) dt + \sigma dW_t
   \]

Therefore,

$$
d(\ln(S_t)) = \left( \mu - \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 \right) dt + \sigma dW_t
$$

This result shows that the logarithm of a stock price following a GBM is also a stochastic process, with a drift adjusted by the term \(- \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2\) and the same volatility \(\sigma\).

### Application: Black-Scholes Equation

Ito's Lemma is instrumental in deriving the Black-Scholes PDE. Consider a European call option \(C(S, t)\) where \(S\) is the stock price and \(t\) is time.

1. **Stock Price Dynamics**:
   \[
   dS_t = \mu S_t dt + \sigma S_t dW_t
   \]

2. **Option Price Dynamics**:
   \[
   dC = \frac{\partial C}{\partial t} dt + \frac{\partial C}{\partial S} dS_t + \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial S^2} (dS_t)^2
   \]

3. **Apply Ito's Lemma**:
   \[
   dC = \left( \frac{\partial C}{\partial t} + \mu S \frac{\partial C}{\partial S} + \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 S^2 \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial S^2} \right) dt + \sigma S \frac{\partial C}{\partial S} dW_t
   \]

4. **Construct a Risk-Free Portfolio**:
   Let \(\Pi\) be a portfolio consisting of a long position in one option and a short position in \(\frac{\partial C}{\partial S}\) shares of the stock:
   \[
   \Pi = C - \frac{\partial C}{\partial S} S
   \]

5. **Dynamics of the Portfolio**:
   \[
   d\Pi = dC - \frac{\partial C}{\partial S} dS
   \]
   Substituting the dynamics of \(dC\) and \(dS\):
   \[
   d\Pi = \left( \frac{\partial C}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 S^2 \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial S^2} \right) dt
   \]

6. **No-Arbitrage Condition**:
   The portfolio \(\Pi\) must earn the risk-free rate \(r\):
   \[
   d\Pi = r \Pi dt
   \]
   \[
   \left( \frac{\partial C}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 S^2 \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial S^2} \right) dt = r \left( C - S \frac{\partial C}{\partial S} \right) dt
   \]

7. **Black-Scholes PDE**:
   Simplifying, we obtain the Black-Scholes partial differential equation:
   \[
   \frac{\partial C}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 S^2 \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial S^2} + r S \frac{\partial C}{\partial S} - r C = 0
   \]

### Conclusion

Ito's Lemma is a powerful tool in stochastic calculus, allowing the transformation of functions of stochastic processes. Its application is crucial in deriving and understanding the dynamics of various financial models, including the Black-Scholes equation for option pricing. Through its systematic approach to handling stochastic differentials, Ito's Lemma provides a foundation for many advanced topics in financial mathematics and stochastic processes.

# Ito's Lemma

[[Ito's Lemma]], also known as the [[Ito-Doeblin formula]], is a fundamental result in [[stochastic calculus]] that provides the chain rule for [[Ito processes]]. It serves as the stochastic analogue of the deterministic chain rule from classical calculus, accounting for the unique properties of [[Brownian motion]].

## Mathematical Formulation

Consider an [[Ito process]] $X_t$ defined by:

$dX_t = \mu(X_t, t)dt + \sigma(X_t, t)dW_t$

For a function $f(x,t)$ that is twice continuously differentiable in $x$ and once in $t$, Ito's Lemma states:

$df(X_t,t) = \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} + \mu\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2}\right)dt + \sigma\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}dW_t$

## Key Components

1. **[[Drift Term]]**: $\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} + \mu\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2}$
   - The first two terms mirror the classical chain rule
   - The third term ($\frac{1}{2}\sigma^2\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2}$) is unique to stochastic calculus and arises from the [[quadratic variation]] of Brownian motion

2. **[[Diffusion Term]]**: $\sigma\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$
   - Represents the stochastic component of the transformed process

## Multidimensional Extension

For an n-dimensional [[Ito process]] $\mathbf{X}_t$ and a scalar function $f(\mathbf{x},t)$:

$df = \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} + \sum_{i=1}^n \mu_i\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^n (\sigma\sigma^T)_{ij}\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_i\partial x_j}\right)dt + \sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^m \sigma_{ij}\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}dW_j$

where:
- $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ is the n-dimensional drift vector
- $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ is the n×m diffusion matrix
- $\mathbf{W}_t$ is an m-dimensional [[Wiener process]]

## Applications

### 1. Financial Mathematics

- **[[Black-Scholes Formula]]** derivation
  - Applied to $f(S_t,t) = e^{-r(T-t)}E[(S_T - K)^+|\mathcal{F}_t]$
  - Where $S_t$ follows [[geometric Brownian motion]]

- **[[Risk-neutral pricing]]**
  - Transformation of probability measures
  - Derivation of [[martingale]] properties

### 2. Theoretical Physics

- **[[Fokker-Planck Equation]]** derivation
  - Evolution of probability distributions
  - Connection to [[quantum mechanics]]

### 3. Stochastic Control

- **[[Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Equation]]**
  - Optimal control strategies
  - [[Dynamic programming]] principles

## Proof Strategy

The proof relies on several key steps:

1. **[[Taylor Expansion]]** to second order:
   $\Delta f \approx \frac{\partial f}{\partial t}\Delta t + \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\Delta x + \frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2}(\Delta x)^2$

2. **[[Quadratic Variation]]** of Brownian motion:
   $(\Delta W)^2 \approx \Delta t$ in mean square as $\Delta t \to 0$

3. **[[Negligibility Lemma]]**:
   Terms of order $(\Delta t)^p$ for $p > 1$ vanish in the limit

## Common Variants

1. **[[Geometric Ito's Lemma]]**
   For processes of the form:
   $d\ln(X_t) = (\mu - \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2)dt + \sigma dW_t$

2. **[[Complex Ito's Lemma]]**
   For complex-valued processes:
   Using [[Cauchy-Riemann equations]] with stochastic terms

## Numerical Implementation

The discrete approximation often uses:

1. **[[Euler-Maruyama Scheme]]**:
   $\Delta f \approx \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} + \mu\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2}\right)\Delta t + \sigma\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\sqrt{\Delta t}Z$
   
   where $Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$

2. **[[Milstein Scheme]]** for improved accuracy

The choice of numerical scheme depends on the desired balance between computational efficiency and accuracy requirements.
