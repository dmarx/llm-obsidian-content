Free Energy Functional


**ASSISTANT**

The free energy functional is a fundamental concept in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, particularly in the study of phase transitions, phase separation, and pattern formation. It extends the concept of free energy to systems with spatially varying order parameters, allowing for the description of inhomogeneous systems and the formation of complex structures.

## Overview

### Definition

The free energy functional \( F[\phi] \) is an integral over a spatially varying field \( \phi(\mathbf{x}) \), which represents the order parameter of the system (e.g., concentration, magnetization). The functional \( F[\phi] \) encapsulates the free energy of the system as a function of the spatial configuration of \( \phi(\mathbf{x}) \).

### General Form

The general form of the free energy functional is:

$$
F[\phi] = \int d^d x \left( f(\phi(\mathbf{x})) + \frac{\kappa}{2} (\nabla \phi(\mathbf{x}))^2 \right)
$$

where:
- \( f(\phi) \) is the local free energy density, typically a function of \( \phi \),
- \( \kappa \) is a positive constant related to the energy cost of spatial gradients in \( \phi \),
- \( \nabla \phi \) represents the spatial variation of \( \phi \),
- \( d \) is the spatial dimensionality of the system.

## Components of the Free Energy Functional

### Local Free Energy Density \( f(\phi) \)

The local free energy density \( f(\phi) \) describes the free energy per unit volume as a function of the order parameter \( \phi \). It often includes terms that account for different phases and interactions in the system. A common form for \( f(\phi) \) is a polynomial expansion, such as a double-well potential:

$$
f(\phi) = \frac{A}{2} \phi^2 + \frac{B}{4} \phi^4
$$

where \( A \) and \( B \) are constants, with \( A < 0 \) ensuring the double-well shape, which represents two stable phases.

### Gradient Term \( \frac{\kappa}{2} (\nabla \phi)^2 \)

The gradient term accounts for the spatial variations in the order parameter and introduces a penalty for sharp interfaces or rapid changes. The constant \( \kappa \) determines the stiffness of the order parameter against these variations.

## Applications

### Phase Separation

In phase separation, the free energy functional describes the process by which a homogeneous mixture separates into distinct phases. The Cahn-Hilliard theory, for example, uses a free energy functional to model the time evolution of concentration fields during [[spinodal decomposition]] and nucleation and growth.

### Pattern Formation

The free energy functional is used to study pattern formation in various physical systems, such as the formation of stripes, spots, or labyrinthine patterns in reaction-diffusion systems and the development of microstructures in materials.

### Phase Transitions

The free energy functional provides a framework for understanding phase transitions, especially continuous (second-order) transitions, where the order parameter changes continuously from zero in one phase to a non-zero value in the other phase.

### Ginzburg-Landau Theory

In the Ginzburg-Landau theory of superconductivity, the free energy functional describes the superconducting order parameter. The functional includes terms for the superconducting pair density and the electromagnetic field, capturing the behavior of superconductors near the critical temperature.

## Examples

### \(\phi^4\) Theory

In \(\phi^4\) theory, the free energy functional is used to describe systems with a scalar order parameter:

$$
F[\phi] = \int d^d x \left( \frac{1}{2} r \phi^2 + \frac{1}{4} u \phi^4 + \frac{1}{2} \kappa (\nabla \phi)^2 \right)
$$

where \( r \) and \( u \) are coefficients related to the temperature and interaction strength, respectively. This form is commonly used to study [[critical phenomena]] and phase transitions.

### Cahn-Hilliard Functional

The Cahn-Hilliard functional models the free energy of a binary mixture undergoing phase separation:

$$
F[\phi] = \int d^d x \left( \frac{A}{2} \phi^2 + \frac{B}{4} \phi^4 + \frac{\kappa}{2} (\nabla \phi)^2 \right)
$$

The dynamics of phase separation are described by the Cahn-Hilliard equation, which governs the time evolution of the order parameter.

### Ginzburg-Landau Functional for Superconductivity

The Ginzburg-Landau functional for a superconductor includes the superconducting order parameter \(\psi\) and the electromagnetic field \(\mathbf{A}\):

$$
F[\psi, \mathbf{A}] = \int d^3 x \left( \alpha |\psi|^2 + \frac{\beta}{2} |\psi|^4 + \frac{\kappa}{2} |(\nabla - 2ie\mathbf{A}) \psi|^2 + \frac{1}{8\pi} (\nabla \times \mathbf{A})^2 \right)
$$

where \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are phenomenological coefficients, \( \mathbf{A} \) is the vector potential of the magnetic field, and \( e \) is the electron charge.

## Numerical Solutions

Numerical methods are often employed to solve the equations derived from the free energy functional, such as the Euler-Lagrange equation or time-dependent equations like the Cahn-Hilliard equation. Common techniques include:

- **Finite Difference Methods**: Discretizing the spatial and temporal derivatives on a regular grid.
- **Spectral Methods**: Using Fourier transforms to solve the equations in the frequency domain.
- **Finite Element Methods**: Discretizing the equations using finite element techniques for complex geometries.
