**ASSISTANT**

The [[Committee of Public Safety]] was a pivotal institution during the [[French Revolution]], particularly during the [[Reign of Terror]]. Established in April 1793 by the National Convention, it played a central role in directing the revolutionary government and ensuring the security of the newly founded French Republic. Here, we explore its creation, structure, key figures, and impact.

## Creation and Purpose

The [[Committee of Public Safety]] was created in response to both internal and external threats faced by revolutionary France. Internally, the political landscape was fraught with conflict between various factions, while externally, France was at war with several European monarchies aiming to quell the revolution and restore the Bourbon monarchy.

The primary purposes of the Committee were:
- **Defense of the Republic**: Protecting the revolutionary government from internal and external threats.
- **Revolutionary Vigilance**: Identifying and eliminating counter-revolutionary elements.
- **War Effort Coordination**: Organizing and directing the military campaigns against foreign and domestic enemies.

## Structure and Authority

The Committee was initially composed of nine, later extended to twelve, members elected by the National Convention. It was vested with extensive powers, effectively functioning as the executive branch of the revolutionary government. Its authority included:

- **Supervision of Ministers**: Overseeing the work of government ministers to ensure they aligned with revolutionary goals.
- **Legislative Initiative**: Proposing and implementing laws, particularly those related to security and public safety.
- **Judicial Oversight**: Establishing and overseeing revolutionary tribunals to expedite the trial and execution of counter-revolutionaries.

## Key Figures

The [[Committee of Public Safety]] was dominated by prominent Jacobin leaders, including:

- **[[Maximilien Robespierre]]**: Often considered the face of the Committee, Robespierre was a staunch advocate of the radical revolutionary agenda and played a key role in the enforcement of the [[Reign of Terror]].
- **[[Georges Couthon]]**: A close ally of Robespierre, known for his uncompromising stance on revolutionary justice.
- **[[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just]]**: Another prominent member, dubbed the "Angel of Death" for his zealous pursuit of counter-revolutionaries.

## Policies and Actions

The Committee's policies were characterized by radical measures aimed at safeguarding the revolution, including:

- **The Law of Suspects**: Enacted on September 17, 1793, this law allowed for the arrest of individuals suspected of opposing the revolution, significantly broadening the scope of political repression.
- **Revolutionary Tribunals**: These tribunals were established to expedite the trials and executions of perceived enemies of the state, often with little regard for due process.
- **Levee en Masse**: A policy of mass conscription introduced in August 1793, mobilizing the entire population for the war effort.

## Impact and Legacy

The actions of the [[Committee of Public Safety]] had a profound impact on the course of the French Revolution:

- **Consolidation of Power**: The Committee centralized authority and curtailed the power of rival factions, particularly the Girondins.
- **Reign of Terror**: Under its direction, the period known as the [[Reign of Terror]] saw thousands of executions and widespread political repression.
- **Military Successes**: The Committee's policies contributed to significant military victories, ensuring the survival of the revolutionary government against both internal insurrections and foreign invaders.

## Decline and Dissolution

The fall of Robespierre on July 27, 1794 (9 Thermidor, Year II in the revolutionary calendar), marked the end of the [[Reign of Terror]] and the beginning of the decline of the [[Committee of Public Safety]]. Robespierre's arrest and execution signaled a backlash against the radical policies of the Committee, leading to a more moderate phase of the revolution.

**USER**

The Law of Suspects


**ASSISTANT**

The [[Law of Suspects]] was a significant legislative measure enacted during the [[Reign of Terror]] in the French Revolution. Passed on September 17, 1793, by the [[National Convention]], it aimed to identify, arrest, and eliminate individuals deemed a threat to the revolutionary government. The law was instrumental in intensifying the political repression of the period. This section explores its background, provisions, implementation, and impact.

## Background

By mid-1793, the French Revolution faced severe internal and external threats:

- **Internal Division**: The political landscape was highly polarized, with factions such as the [[Girondins]] and [[Jacobins]] in fierce conflict. The fall of the Girondins in June 1793 marked a shift towards radicalization under the Jacobins.
- **External War**: France was engaged in wars with several European coalitions aiming to suppress the revolution and restore the monarchy.
- **Economic Crisis**: Widespread food shortages and economic instability fueled public unrest.

In this context, the [[Committee of Public Safety]] sought to consolidate power and address these threats through stringent measures, leading to the enactment of the [[Law of Suspects]].

## Provisions

The [[Law of Suspects]] significantly broadened the criteria for arrest and detention, targeting a wide range of individuals perceived as enemies of the revolution. Key provisions included:

- **Suspect Categories**: The law outlined several categories of suspects, including:
  - **Former Nobility**: Individuals who had held noble titles or positions under the monarchy.
  - **Relatives of Emigres**: Families of those who had fled France since the start of the revolution.
  - **Government Officials**: Officials who had been dismissed or replaced under the new revolutionary regime.
  - **Individuals Without Proof of Citizenship**: People who could not demonstrate active support for the revolution.
  - **Anti-Revolutionary Behavior**: Any individual whose conduct, associations, or writings indicated opposition to the revolutionary cause.

- **Mandate for Local Committees**: The law empowered local revolutionary committees to identify and arrest suspects, bypassing traditional legal procedures.

- **House Arrest and Detention**: Suspects could be placed under house arrest or detained in prisons and other facilities designated for this purpose.

## Implementation

The [[Law of Suspects]] was implemented swiftly and rigorously:

- **Local Revolutionary Committees**: These committees were tasked with identifying suspects and coordinating their arrest and detention. They operated with considerable autonomy and were often driven by local political dynamics.
- **Revolutionary Tribunals**: Suspects were tried by these tribunals, which were known for their expedited and often arbitrary procedures. The right to a fair trial was severely limited, and many suspects faced summary executions.
- **Public Support and Fear**: The law relied on public support and denunciations, creating an atmosphere of suspicion and fear. Neighbors, colleagues, and even family members could denounce each other as suspects.

## Impact

The [[Law of Suspects]] had profound and far-reaching consequences:

- **Mass Arrests and Executions**: Tens of thousands of people were arrested under the law, and many were executed by guillotine. The exact number of victims remains debated, but estimates suggest that tens of thousands were executed or died in custody.
- **Political Repression**: The law facilitated the elimination of political rivals and dissenters, consolidating the power of the Jacobin faction led by [[Maximilien Robespierre]].
- **Social and Economic Disruption**: The widespread arrests and executions disrupted communities and economies, contributing to the instability of the period.
- **Legacy of Fear**: The [[Law of Suspects]] created a climate of pervasive fear and mistrust, which had lasting effects on the French society and the revolutionary movement.

## End of the Law and Aftermath

The fall of Robespierre on July 27, 1794 (9 Thermidor, Year II) led to the repeal of the [[Law of Suspects]] and the end of the [[Reign of Terror]]. The Thermidorian Reaction, a more moderate phase of the revolution, sought to curtail the excesses of the previous regime and restore legal norms.
