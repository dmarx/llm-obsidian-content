**ASSISTANT**

Ward identities are fundamental relationships in quantum field theory that arise from symmetries of the action. They express the conservation laws corresponding to these symmetries in terms of correlation functions of the theory. In the context of [[conformal field theory]] (CFT) and [[gauge theories]], Ward identities are particularly powerful tools for understanding the constraints imposed by symmetry.

## Overview

### Origin of Ward Identities

Ward identities are named after John Clive Ward, who first derived them in the context of quantum electrodynamics (QED). They generalize Noether's theorem, which relates symmetries of the action to conserved currents, to the quantum level, providing constraints on the correlation functions.

### General Form

Consider a quantum field theory with an action \(S\) that is invariant under a symmetry transformation parameterized by \(\alpha\). The generating functional \(Z[J]\) with source terms \(J\) is given by:

$$
Z[J] = \int \mathcal{D}\phi \, e^{iS[\phi] + i\int J\phi}
$$

A symmetry transformation \(\delta \phi = \alpha \Delta \phi\) leads to a Ward identity of the form:

$$
\left\langle \delta \left( \frac{\delta S}{\delta \phi} + J \right) \right\rangle = 0
$$

Inserting the explicit form of the symmetry transformation \(\Delta \phi\) yields specific identities for correlation functions.

## Ward Identities in Conformal Field Theory

### Conformal Symmetry

In CFT, Ward identities arise from the invariance of the theory under conformal transformations, including translations, rotations, dilations, and special conformal transformations.

### Stress-Energy Tensor

The stress-energy tensor \(T_{\mu\nu}\) plays a central role in deriving conformal Ward identities. It generates conformal transformations, and its conservation leads to Ward identities for correlation functions of primary operators.

#### Translation Ward Identity

For translations, the Ward identity is given by the conservation of the stress-energy tensor:

$$
\partial^\mu \langle T_{\mu\nu}(x) \mathcal{O}_1(x_1) \cdots \mathcal{O}_n(x_n) \rangle = -\sum_{i=1}^n \delta(x - x_i) \partial_\nu \langle \mathcal{O}_1(x_1) \cdots \mathcal{O}_n(x_n) \rangle
$$

#### Dilation Ward Identity

For dilations, the Ward identity relates the scaling dimension \(\Delta\) of an operator \(\mathcal{O}(x)\):

$$
\left( \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^\mu \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i^\mu} + n\Delta \right) \langle \mathcal{O}_1(x_1) \cdots \mathcal{O}_n(x_n) \rangle = 0
$$

#### Special Conformal Transformation Ward Identity

For special conformal transformations, the Ward identity involves the special conformal generator \(K_\mu\):

$$
\left( \sum_{i=1}^n \left( 2x_i^\mu x_i^\nu \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i^\nu} - x_i^2 \frac{\partial}{\partial x_{i\mu}} \right) + 2\Delta x_i^\mu \right) \langle \mathcal{O}_1(x_1) \cdots \mathcal{O}_n(x_n) \rangle = 0
$$

### Example: Two-Dimensional CFT

In 2D CFT, the stress-energy tensor has components \(T(z)\) and \(\bar{T}(\bar{z})\). The Ward identities for these components provide constraints on the correlation functions of primary fields \(\phi(z, \bar{z})\):

$$
\langle T(z) \phi(w, \bar{w}) \rangle = \left( \frac{h}{(z-w)^2} + \frac{1}{z-w} \partial_w \right) \langle \phi(w, \bar{w}) \rangle
$$

$$
\langle \bar{T}(\bar{z}) \phi(w, \bar{w}) \rangle = \left( \frac{\bar{h}}{(\bar{z}-\bar{w})^2} + \frac{1}{\bar{z}-\bar{w}} \partial_{\bar{w}} \right) \langle \phi(w, \bar{w}) \rangle
$$

These identities impose strong constraints on the form of the correlation functions and are fundamental in the analysis of 2D CFTs.

## Ward Identities in Gauge Theories

### Gauge Symmetry

In [[gauge theories]], Ward identities arise from the invariance under local gauge transformations. For example, in QED, the gauge invariance of the action leads to the Ward identity:

$$
q_\mu \langle J^\mu(q) J^\nu(-q) \rangle = 0
$$

where \(J^\mu\) is the electromagnetic current, and \(q\) is the momentum transfer.

### BRST Symmetry

In the quantization of [[gauge theories]] using the BRST formalism, Ward identities, known as Slavnov-Taylor identities, ensure the consistency of the gauge-fixed theory. They play a crucial role in the renormalization and the proof of unitarity.

## Applications

### Anomalies

Ward identities are essential in the study of anomalies, which occur when classical symmetries are broken at the quantum level. For example, the Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly in QED is derived from the Ward identity involving the axial current.

### Conformal Bootstrap

In the conformal bootstrap approach, Ward identities are used to derive crossing symmetry constraints on the [[operator product expansion]] (OPE) and correlation functions, allowing for the non-perturbative determination of operator dimensions and OPE coefficients.

### Renormalization

Ward identities are used in the renormalization of quantum field theories to ensure that the renormalized theory preserves the symmetries of the original action.

## Mathematical Formalism

### Generating Functional

The generating functional \(Z[J]\) for correlation functions with source terms \(J\) is central to deriving Ward identities. Variations of \(Z[J]\) under symmetry transformations provide the starting point for deriving these identities.

### Noether's Theorem

Noether's theorem relates continuous symmetries of the action to conserved currents. Ward identities can be viewed as the quantum analogs of these conservation laws, expressed in terms of correlation functions.

### Path Integral Formulation

In the path integral formulation, Ward identities can be derived by considering the invariance of the path integral measure under symmetry transformations, leading to integral relations among correlation functions.

Stress-Energy Tensor


**ASSISTANT**

The stress-energy tensor, also known as the energy-momentum tensor, is a fundamental object in both classical and quantum field theory. It encapsulates the density and flux of energy and momentum in spacetime and plays a crucial role in formulating conservation laws and interacting with gravitational fields.

## Overview

### Definition

In a field theory, the stress-energy tensor \( T_{\mu\nu} \) is defined as:

$$
T_{\mu\nu} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial (\partial^\mu \phi)} \partial_\nu \phi - \eta_{\mu\nu} \mathcal{L}
$$

where:
- \( \mathcal{L} \) is the Lagrangian density of the field,
- \( \phi \) represents the fields in the theory,
- \( \eta_{\mu\nu} \) is the metric tensor (usually taken as the Minkowski metric in flat spacetime).

### Properties

1. **Symmetry**: For most physical systems, the stress-energy tensor is symmetric: \( T_{\mu\nu} = T_{\nu\mu} \).
2. **Conservation**: The conservation of energy and momentum is expressed by the vanishing divergence of \( T_{\mu\nu} \):
   $$
   \partial^\mu T_{\mu\nu} = 0
   $$
3. **Role in General Relativity**: In general relativity, the stress-energy tensor acts as the source of the gravitational field, appearing on the right-hand side of Einstein's field equations:
   $$
   G_{\mu\nu} = 8 \pi G T_{\mu\nu}
   $$
   where \( G_{\mu\nu} \) is the Einstein tensor and \( G \) is Newton's gravitational constant.

## Stress-Energy Tensor in Field Theories

### Scalar Field Theory

For a real scalar field \( \phi \) with Lagrangian density:

$$
\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2} \partial^\mu \phi \partial_\mu \phi - V(\phi)
$$

the stress-energy tensor is:

$$
T_{\mu\nu} = \partial_\mu \phi \partial_\nu \phi - \eta_{\mu\nu} \left( \frac{1}{2} \partial^\lambda \phi \partial_\lambda \phi - V(\phi) \right)
$$

### Electromagnetic Field

For the electromagnetic field, described by the field strength tensor \( F_{\mu\nu} = \partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu \), where \( A_\mu \) is the gauge field, the Lagrangian density is:

$$
\mathcal{L} = -\frac{1}{4} F^{\mu\nu} F_{\mu\nu}
$$

The stress-energy tensor is:

$$
T_{\mu\nu} = F_{\mu\lambda} F_\nu{}^\lambda + \frac{1}{4} \eta_{\mu\nu} F^{\alpha\beta} F_{\alpha\beta}
$$

### Dirac Field

For a Dirac field \( \psi \) with Lagrangian density:

$$
\mathcal{L} = \bar{\psi} (i \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu - m) \psi
$$

the stress-energy tensor is:

$$
T_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2} \left( \bar{\psi} \gamma_\mu \partial_\nu \psi - \partial_\nu \bar{\psi} \gamma_\mu \psi \right) - \eta_{\mu\nu} \mathcal{L}
$$

## Conformal Field Theory

In [[conformal field theory]] (CFT), the stress-energy tensor plays a special role due to the enhanced symmetry. In 2D CFT, the stress-energy tensor can be decomposed into holomorphic and antiholomorphic parts:

$$
T(z) \quad \text{and} \quad \bar{T}(\bar{z})
$$

where \( z \) and \( \bar{z} \) are complex coordinates. These components generate the conformal transformations through their operator product expansions (OPEs).

### Virasoro Algebra

The modes of the stress-energy tensor in 2D CFT satisfy the Virasoro algebra:

$$
L_n = \oint \frac{dz}{2\pi i} z^{n+1} T(z)
$$

with the commutation relations:

$$
[L_m, L_n] = (m-n) L_{m+n} + \frac{c}{12} m (m^2 - 1) \delta_{m+n,0}
$$

where \( c \) is the central charge of the CFT.

### Ward Identities in CFT

Ward identities in CFT relate the variations of correlation functions under conformal transformations to insertions of the stress-energy tensor. For a primary field \( \phi(z, \bar{z}) \) with conformal dimensions \( (h, \bar{h}) \), the Ward identity is:

$$
\langle T(z) \phi(w, \bar{w}) \rangle = \left( \frac{h}{(z-w)^2} + \frac{1}{z-w} \partial_w \right) \langle \phi(w, \bar{w}) \rangle
$$

## Applications

### Energy and Momentum Conservation

The conservation of the stress-energy tensor implies the conservation of energy and momentum in the theory. In the presence of external fields or sources, the divergence of \( T_{\mu\nu} \) provides information about energy and momentum exchange.

### General Relativity

In general relativity, the stress-energy tensor serves as the source term for the gravitational field. It describes the distribution of matter and energy in spacetime, influencing the curvature of spacetime according to Einstein's field equations.

### Quantum Field Theory

In quantum field theory, the stress-energy tensor is crucial for defining and understanding various physical quantities, including the Hamiltonian (energy operator) and the momentum operator. It also plays a role in the analysis of anomalies and the renormalization of quantum field theories.
