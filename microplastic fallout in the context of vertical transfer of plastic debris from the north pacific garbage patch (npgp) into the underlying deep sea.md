microplastic fallout in the context of vertical transfer of plastic debris from the North Pacific Garbage Patch (NPGP) into the underlying deep sea


**ASSISTANT**

The **vertical transfer of plastic debris from the North Pacific Garbage Patch (NPGP)** into the underlying deep sea is a critical process that redistributes microplastics from the ocean surface to the deep-sea ecosystem. This phenomenon links surface plastic pollution, particularly in regions of high concentration like the NPGP, with the broader oceanic and deep-sea environments.

### Overview: The North Pacific Garbage Patch and Vertical Transport

The **North Pacific Garbage Patch** is a large accumulation of floating plastic debris located in the North Pacific Ocean. It forms due to the convergence of ocean currents in the [[North Pacific Gyre]], trapping plastics and other buoyant materials. While this plastic debris remains largely at the surface or in the upper water column, recent studies have highlighted that significant amounts of plastic are sinking into the deep sea, a process referred to as **vertical transfer**.

### Mechanisms of Vertical Transfer of Plastics

Several processes contribute to the sinking of plastic debris from the NPGP into deeper waters, where it eventually settles on the seafloor:

1. **Ballasting by Organic Matter**:
   - One of the primary mechanisms involves the attachment of **organic particles** to floating plastics, particularly microplastics. These include biological materials such as phytoplankton, zooplankton, and detritus (marine snow).
   - When these biological particles aggregate with microplastics, they increase the density of the plastics, causing them to sink. The resulting **biofouled plastics** can then be carried into the deep ocean by gravity. This process is referred to as **ballasting**, where the plastics act as nuclei for the formation of sinking particulate matter.

2. **Zooplankton and Marine Organisms**:
   - Zooplankton, such as krill or copepods, often ingest microplastics floating at the surface. These plastics can be either excreted as fecal pellets or retained within the organisms as they migrate vertically through the water column in their daily foraging routines. This vertical movement, known as **diel vertical migration**, is a key transport mechanism.
   - During vertical migration, zooplankton and other marine organisms transport plastic particles from the euphotic (sunlit) zone to deeper waters, where they can be deposited as they are excreted or die.

3. **Fragmentation and Weathering**:
   - Larger pieces of plastic in the NPGP break down over time due to UV radiation, mechanical abrasion, and chemical degradation. As these macroplastics fragment into smaller pieces, they can become negatively buoyant, especially when waterlogged, facilitating their sinking into deeper waters.
   - This process is especially relevant for heavier polymers (e.g., **polyvinyl chloride (PVC)**) that are more likely to sink after sufficient degradation.

4. **Sinking of Marine Snow**:
   - Microplastics can become embedded in **marine snow**â€”aggregates of organic matter that sink from the upper layers of the ocean. Marine snow is an important vertical flux mechanism that transfers organic material (and, now, plastic particles) to the deep sea. As marine snow settles on the seafloor, it carries attached microplastics along with it.

5. **Physical Oceanographic Processes**:
   - **Ocean currents**, vertical mixing, and eddies can also contribute to the redistribution of plastics from the surface to deeper layers. In particular, subduction zones where water masses sink, or deep ocean currents, could transport microplastics downward.

### Impacts on the Deep-Sea Ecosystem

Once plastics settle in the deep sea, they become part of the benthic environment, impacting deep-sea organisms and ecosystems in several ways:

- **Ingestion by Deep-Sea Organisms**: Many deep-sea species, including invertebrates and fish, have been observed ingesting microplastics. These organisms may mistake plastics for food, leading to digestive blockages, malnutrition, and even mortality. Deep-sea filter feeders and detritivores are particularly vulnerable.
  
- **Chemical Contaminants**: Plastics are often carriers of harmful chemical additives (e.g., phthalates, bisphenol A) or can adsorb persistent organic pollutants (POPs) from seawater. When these plastics are ingested by deep-sea organisms, they may introduce toxic substances into the deep ocean food web.

- **Alteration of Sediment Properties**: Microplastics deposited on the seafloor can affect the physical and chemical properties of sediments. For example, they may alter the porosity and water retention capabilities of marine sediments, which can influence benthic microbial communities and nutrient cycling.

### Quantification and Modeling of Vertical Transfer

Quantifying the vertical transfer of plastics from the NPGP to the deep sea involves both observational studies and numerical models. The **flux of microplastics** sinking into the deep sea is typically expressed in terms of mass per unit area per unit time. This can be described by a flux equation:
$$
F_{\text{plastic}} = \int_0^\infty P(z) \cdot v_s \, dz
$$
Where:
- $F_{\text{plastic}}$ is the vertical flux of microplastics (e.g., grams per square meter per day),
- $P(z)$ is the concentration of microplastics at depth $z$,
- $v_s$ is the sinking velocity of plastic particles, which depends on their size, shape, and degree of [[biofouling]].

The sinking velocity $v_s$ can be modeled using **Stokes' Law** for small, spherical particles:
$$
v_s = \frac{2r^2 (\rho_p - \rho_w)g}{9 \eta}
$$
Where:
- $r$ is the radius of the plastic particle,
- $\rho_p$ and $\rho_w$ are the densities of the plastic and seawater, respectively,
- $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity,
- $\eta$ is the dynamic viscosity of seawater.

For biofouled particles, the effective density $\rho_p$ is altered by the attached organic matter, leading to increased sinking velocities.

### Broader Implications

The vertical transfer of plastic from the NPGP is part of a broader redistribution of plastic pollution across marine ecosystems. While the NPGP is often viewed as a surface phenomenon, this deep-sea plastic fallout represents a significant and poorly understood environmental problem. It is estimated that **over 99% of oceanic plastics are not floating at the surface** but are instead distributed throughout the water column and seafloor.

Understanding these vertical transport mechanisms helps to quantify the global plastic cycle and highlights the need for addressing plastic pollution not just at the surface, but throughout marine environments. Further research into the rates of vertical transfer and the long-term ecological consequences will be critical for predicting the persistence of plastics in oceanic ecosystems.
