**USER**

incentive-compatible mechanisms


**ASSISTANT**

The user is asking for a wiki entry on "incentive-compatible mechanisms". This is a core concept in [[mechanism design theory]] and economics. I need to provide a deeply technical, mathematical treatment that would be suitable for someone with graduate degrees in applied mathematics, statistics, and philosophy of science.

Key topics to cover:
1. Formal definition of incentive compatibility
2. Different types (dominant strategy, Bayesian)
3. Revelation principle
4. Implementation theory
5. Mathematical characterizations
6. VCG mechanisms
7. Revenue equivalence
8. Myerson's characterization
9. Applications
10. Computational aspects

I should provide formal mathematical definitions with precise notation, and wrap novel terms in double brackets for wiki-style linking.# Incentive-Compatible Mechanisms

## Overview

[[Incentive-Compatible Mechanisms]] constitute a fundamental class of [[mechanism design]] solutions where truthful revelation of private information represents a [[weakly dominant strategy]] or [[Bayesian Nash equilibrium]] for all participating agents. These mechanisms solve the central problem of [[information asymmetry]] in economic environments by aligning individual incentives with social objectives.

## Formal Definitions

### Basic Setup

Consider an environment with $n$ agents, where agent $i$ possesses [[private type]] $\theta_i \in \Theta_i$. The [[type profile]] is $\boldsymbol{\theta} = (\theta_1, \ldots, \theta_n) \in \boldsymbol{\Theta} = \prod_{i=1}^n \Theta_i$.

A [[direct mechanism]] is a tuple $\mathcal{M} = (\mathbf{f}, \mathbf{t})$ where:
- $\mathbf{f}: \boldsymbol{\Theta} \rightarrow \mathcal{A}$ is the [[allocation rule]]
- $\mathbf{t}: \boldsymbol{\Theta} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ is the [[transfer rule]]

Agent $i$'s [[utility function]] is:
$$u_i(\theta_i, a, t_i) = v_i(\theta_i, a) + t_i$$

where $v_i(\theta_i, a)$ represents [[valuation]] over outcomes $a \in \mathcal{A}$.

### Dominant Strategy Incentive Compatibility

A mechanism is [[Dominant Strategy Incentive Compatible]] (DSIC) if:

$$\forall i, \forall \theta_i, \forall \hat{\theta}_i, \forall \boldsymbol{\theta}_{-i}: u_i(\theta_i, \mathbf{f}(\theta_i, \boldsymbol{\theta}_{-i}), t_i(\theta_i, \boldsymbol{\theta}_{-i})) \geq u_i(\theta_i, \mathbf{f}(\hat{\theta}_i, \boldsymbol{\theta}_{-i}), t_i(\hat{\theta}_i, \boldsymbol{\theta}_{-i}))$$

This condition ensures that truth-telling is optimal regardless of other agents' strategies.

### Bayesian Incentive Compatibility

A mechanism is [[Bayesian Incentive Compatible]] (BIC) if:

$$\forall i, \forall \theta_i: \mathbb{E}_{\boldsymbol{\theta}_{-i}}[u_i(\theta_i, \mathbf{f}(\theta_i, \boldsymbol{\theta}_{-i}), t_i(\theta_i, \boldsymbol{\theta}_{-i}))] \geq \mathbb{E}_{\boldsymbol{\theta}_{-i}}[u_i(\theta_i, \mathbf{f}(\hat{\theta}_i, \boldsymbol{\theta}_{-i}), t_i(\hat{\theta}_i, \boldsymbol{\theta}_{-i}))]$$

where the expectation is taken with respect to the [[prior distribution]] over $\boldsymbol{\theta}_{-i}$.

## The Revelation Principle

### Statement

**[[Revelation Principle]]**: For any [[social choice function]] $f: \boldsymbol{\Theta} \rightarrow \mathcal{A}$ implementable in dominant strategies (or Bayesian Nash equilibrium), there exists a direct mechanism that is DSIC (or BIC) and implements $f$.

### Proof Sketch

Given an indirect mechanism $\Gamma = (S_1, \ldots, S_n, g, \mathbf{t}')$ with [[equilibrium strategy profile]] $\boldsymbol{\sigma}^*(\boldsymbol{\theta})$, construct the direct mechanism:

$$\mathbf{f}(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = g(\boldsymbol{\sigma}^*(\boldsymbol{\theta}))$$
$$\mathbf{t}(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \mathbf{t}'(\boldsymbol{\sigma}^*(\boldsymbol{\theta}))$$

The [[revelation principle]] justifies focusing on direct, truthful mechanisms without loss of generality.

## Characterization Results

### Myerson's Characterization (Single-Dimensional Types)

For single-dimensional types $\Theta_i \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, a mechanism $(\mathbf{f}, \mathbf{t})$ is BIC if and only if:

1. **[[Monotonicity Condition]]**: $\frac{\partial f_i(\theta_i, \boldsymbol{\theta}_{-i})}{\partial \theta_i} \geq 0$ for all $i, \boldsymbol{\theta}_{-i}$

2. **[[Payment Identity]]**: 
$$t_i(\theta_i, \boldsymbol{\theta}_{-i}) = \theta_i f_i(\theta_i, \boldsymbol{\theta}_{-i}) - \int_{\underline{\theta}_i}^{\theta_i} f_i(s, \boldsymbol{\theta}_{-i}) ds + h_i(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{-i})$$

where $h_i(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{-i})$ is an arbitrary function independent of $\theta_i$.

### Multidimensional Characterization

For multidimensional types, [[local incentive compatibility]] requires:

$$\nabla_{\theta_i} U_i(\theta_i, \boldsymbol{\theta}_{-i}) = \nabla_{\theta_i} v_i(\theta_i, \mathbf{f}(\theta_i, \boldsymbol{\theta}_{-i}))$$

where $U_i(\theta_i, \boldsymbol{\theta}_{-i}) = v_i(\theta_i, \mathbf{f}(\theta_i, \boldsymbol{\theta}_{-i})) + t_i(\theta_i, \boldsymbol{\theta}_{-i})$.

## VCG Mechanisms

### Definition

The [[Vickrey-Clarke-Groves]] (VCG) mechanism implements the [[efficient allocation]]:

$$\mathbf{f}^*(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \arg\max_{a \in \mathcal{A}} \sum_{i=1}^n v_i(\theta_i, a)$$

with [[VCG payments]]:

$$t_i(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \sum_{j \neq i} v_j(\theta_j, \mathbf{f}^*(\boldsymbol{\theta})) - \max_{a \in \mathcal{A}} \sum_{j \neq i} v_j(\theta_j, a)$$

### Properties

1. **DSIC**: Truth-telling is a dominant strategy
2. **[[Individual Rationality]]**: $U_i(\theta_i, \boldsymbol{\theta}_{-i}) \geq 0$ for all $\theta_i, \boldsymbol{\theta}_{-i}$
3. **[[Efficiency]]**: Maximizes social welfare

### Limitations

- May require [[budget imbalance]] (payments may not sum to zero)
- Vulnerable to [[collusion]]
- May not satisfy [[revenue maximization]] objectives

## Revenue Equivalence

### Revenue Equivalence Theorem

**Statement**: In symmetric environments with single-dimensional types, any two mechanisms that:
1. Achieve the same allocation rule
2. Give the same expected utility to the lowest type
3. Are incentive compatible and individually rational

yield the same expected revenue.

### Mathematical Formulation

For mechanisms $(\mathbf{f}, \mathbf{t})$ and $(\mathbf{f}', \mathbf{t}')$ satisfying the conditions:

$$\mathbb{E}_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}[\sum_{i=1}^n t_i(\boldsymbol{\theta})] = \mathbb{E}_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}[\sum_{i=1}^n t'_i(\boldsymbol{\theta})]$$

## Optimal Mechanism Design

### Myerson's Optimal Auction

For revenue maximization in single-object auctions, the optimal mechanism allocates to the bidder with highest [[virtual valuation]]:

$$\phi_i(\theta_i) = \theta_i - \frac{1-F_i(\theta_i)}{f_i(\theta_i)}$$

where $F_i$ and $f_i$ are the CDF and PDF of bidder $i$'s type distribution.

### Optimal Allocation Rule

$$x_i(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } i = \arg\max_j \max\{0, \phi_j(\theta_j)\} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

### Ironing

When virtual valuations are not monotonic, [[ironing]] procedures ensure implementability:

$$\hat{\phi}_i(\theta_i) = \min_{s \geq \theta_i} \frac{\int_{\theta_i}^s \phi_i(t) f_i(t) dt}{\int_{\theta_i}^s f_i(t) dt}$$

## Implementation Theory

### Social Choice Functions

A [[social choice function]] $f: \boldsymbol{\Theta} \rightarrow \mathcal{A}$ is [[implementable in dominant strategies]] if there exists a mechanism where truth-telling forms a dominant strategy equilibrium.

### Necessary Conditions

For implementation in dominant strategies:
1. **[[Monotonicity]]**: If $f(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = a$ and $v_i(\theta_i, a) \geq v_i(\theta_i, f(\theta_i', \boldsymbol{\theta}_{-i}))$ for all $\theta_i'$ implies $f(\theta_i', \boldsymbol{\theta}_{-i}) = a$

### Gibbard-Satterthwaite Theorem

**Statement**: With at least three alternatives and universal domain, the only dominant strategy implementable social choice functions are [[dictatorial]].

## Computational Considerations

### Algorithmic Mechanism Design

The [[computational complexity]] of winner determination affects mechanism design. For [[NP-hard]] problems, [[approximation mechanisms]] may sacrifice incentive compatibility:

$$\text{Approximation Ratio} = \frac{\text{OPT}}{\text{ALG}} \leq \rho$$

### Truthfulness vs. Approximation Trade-offs

[[Nisan-Ronen]] showed that certain problems exhibit fundamental trade-offs between [[approximation quality]] and [[truthfulness]].

## Extensions and Variations

### Ex-Post Incentive Compatibility

A stronger notion requiring:

$$\forall i, \forall \theta_i, \forall \hat{\theta}_i, \forall \boldsymbol{\theta}_{-i}: u_i(\theta_i, \mathbf{f}(\theta_i, \boldsymbol{\theta}_{-i}), t_i(\theta_i, \boldsymbol{\theta}_{-i})) \geq u_i(\theta_i, \mathbf{f}(\hat{\theta}_i, \boldsymbol{\theta}_{-i}), t_i(\hat{\theta}_i, \boldsymbol{\theta}_{-i}))$$

for each realization of $\boldsymbol{\theta}_{-i}$.

### Group Strategy-Proofness

Protection against [[coalitional deviations]]:

$$\forall S \subseteq N, \forall \boldsymbol{\theta}_S, \forall \hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}_S: \exists i \in S \text{ s.t. } u_i(\theta_i, \mathbf{f}(\boldsymbol{\theta}_S, \boldsymbol{\theta}_{-S}), t_i(\boldsymbol{\theta}_S, \boldsymbol{\theta}_{-S})) \geq u_i(\theta_i, \mathbf{f}(\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}_S, \boldsymbol{\theta}_{-S}), t_i(\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}_S, \boldsymbol{\theta}_{-S}))$$

### Dynamic Mechanisms

In [[repeated settings]], agents have incentives to [[manipulate future mechanism parameters]]. [[Dynamic incentive compatibility]] requires:

$$\forall t, \forall h^t, \forall \theta_i^t, \forall \hat{\theta}_i^t: U_i^t(\theta_i^t | h^t, \text{truth}) \geq U_i^t(\theta_i^t | h^t, \hat{\theta}_i^t)$$

where $h^t$ represents the [[history]] up to period $t$.
