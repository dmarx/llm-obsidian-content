# Dissipation as Consumption

[[Dissipation]] can be reframed as [[energetic consumption]] through examination of the role of [[entropy production]] in physical systems. This perspective highlights the relationship between [[irreversible processes]] and [[information loss]].

## Mathematical Framework

### Information-Theoretic Formulation

The [[entropy production rate]] (σ) can be expressed in terms of [[information consumption]] (I):

σ = kₐI

where kₐ is [[Landauer's constant]]. This connects to [[physical dissipation]] (P_d) through temperature (T):

P_d = Tσ = TkₐI

### Consumption Metrics

The [[rate of information consumption]] (I_rate) in a dynamical system can be quantified through the [[phase space contraction rate]]:

I_rate = -∇·v

where v is the [[phase space velocity]]. This directly relates to the system's [[attractor dimension]] through the [[Kaplan-Yorke formula]].

## Physical Manifestations

### [[Computational Processes]]
- [[Bit erasure]]: ΔS ≥ k_B ln(2) per bit
- [[Logical operations]]: Minimum energy E = k_BTln(2)
- [[Memory reset]]: Requires physical work

### [[Dynamical Systems]]
- [[Phase space mixing]]
- [[Attractor formation]]
- [[Ergodicity breaking]]

## Theoretical Implications

### [[Thermodynamic Irreversibility]]
Consumption through dissipation manifests as:
- [[Time asymmetry]]
- [[State space collapse]]
- [[Information destruction]]

### [[Computational Bounds]]
The [[dissipative computation]] framework establishes:
- [[Minimal energy requirements]]
- [[Computational complexity]] limits
- [[Physical realizability]] constraints

This perspective provides deep connections between [[statistical mechanics]], [[information theory]], and [[computational thermodynamics]], suggesting fundamental limits on [[physical computation]] and [[reversible processes]].
