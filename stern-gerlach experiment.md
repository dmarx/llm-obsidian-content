The Stern-Gerlach Experiment


**ASSISTANT**

The Stern-Gerlach experiment is a foundational experiment in quantum mechanics that demonstrated the quantization of angular momentum. Here's a detailed overview:

## Overview of the Stern-Gerlach Experiment

### Historical Context and Setup

The Stern-Gerlach experiment was conducted by [[Otto Stern|Stern]] and [[Walther Gerlach|Gerlach]] in 1922. The primary aim was to test the theory of space quantization proposed by [[Niels Bohr|Bohr]] and [[Arnold Sommerfeld|Sommerfeld]].

The experimental setup includes:
- A source of neutral silver atoms.
- A non-uniform magnetic field.
- A detection screen to observe the deflection pattern of the atoms.

### Theoretical Background

#### Quantum Angular Momentum

In classical mechanics, angular momentum $\mathbf{L}$ is a continuous vector quantity. In quantum mechanics, however, angular momentum is quantized. For an electron, the angular momentum is described by the operator $\hat{L}$, and its components are quantized in units of $\hbar$ (reduced Planck's constant).

$$
L_z = m_l \hbar \quad \text{where} \quad m_l = -l, -l+1, \ldots, l-1, l
$$

Here, $l$ is the orbital quantum number, and $m_l$ is the magnetic quantum number.

#### Spin Angular Momentum

The Stern-Gerlach experiment crucially demonstrates the quantization of spin angular momentum. Unlike orbital angular momentum, spin angular momentum $\mathbf{S}$ is intrinsic to particles.

For electrons (spin-1/2 particles), the spin component along any axis, such as $z$, is given by:

$$
S_z = m_s \hbar \quad \text{where} \quad m_s = \pm \frac{1}{2}
$$

### Experiment Execution and Observations

1. **Atomic Beam Production**: Silver atoms are heated in an oven and directed through a collimator to form a narrow beam.

2. **Magnetic Field Interaction**: The beam passes through an inhomogeneous magnetic field, typically with a gradient along the $z$-axis. The interaction Hamiltonian is:

$$
H = -\mu \cdot B
$$

where $\mu$ is the magnetic moment of the atom and $B$ is the magnetic field.

3. **Deflection and Detection**: Due to the inhomogeneous magnetic field, the force on the magnetic moment $\mu$ causes the atoms to be deflected. The force is given by:

$$
\mathbf{F} = \nabla (\mu \cdot B)
$$

The deflection depends on the component of the magnetic moment along the field gradient direction. For a non-uniform field $B_z = B'_z z$, the force in the $z$-direction is:

$$
F_z = \mu_z \frac{\partial B_z}{\partial z}
$$

Since $\mu_z$ is quantized (for silver atoms, $\mu_z = \pm \mu_B$, where $\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton), the beam splits into discrete spots on the detection screen corresponding to $S_z = \pm \frac{1}{2}$.

### Implications and Consequences

The Stern-Gerlach experiment provided direct evidence of:
- The quantization of angular momentum.
- The existence of electron spin and its intrinsic nature.
- The fundamental principles underlying [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanics]].

### Mathematical Formalism

To describe the evolution of the spin state, we use the spin operators $\hat{S}_x$, $\hat{S}_y$, and $\hat{S}_z$ satisfying the commutation relations:

$$
[\hat{S}_i, \hat{S}_j] = i\hbar \epsilon_{ijk} \hat{S}_k
$$

For a spin-1/2 particle, the spin states are represented by two-component spinors, and the spin operators are given by the Pauli matrices $\sigma_i$:

$$
\hat{S}_i = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_i \quad \text{where} \quad i = x, y, z
$$

The eigenvalues of $\hat{S}_z$ are $\pm \frac{\hbar}{2}$, corresponding to the two possible outcomes observed in the Stern-Gerlach experiment.

### Conclusion

The Stern-Gerlach experiment is a critical demonstration of the principles of quantum mechanics, showcasing the discrete nature of angular momentum and the intrinsic property of spin. This experiment laid the groundwork for the development of quantum theory and the understanding of fundamental particles.
