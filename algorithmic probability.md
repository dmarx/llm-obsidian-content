# Algorithmic Probability

**Algorithmic probability** represents a fundamental approach to [[inductive inference]] based on [[Kolmogorov complexity]], providing a mathematically rigorous foundation for assigning probabilities to sequences and making predictions about future observations.

## Theoretical Foundation

The core insight underlying algorithmic probability is that the probability of a sequence should be inversely related to its [[algorithmic complexity]]. Given a [[universal Turing machine]] $U$, the **algorithmic probability** of a binary string $x$ is defined as:

$$P_U(x) = \sum_{p: U(p) = x} 2^{-|p|}$$

where the sum is taken over all programs $p$ that cause $U$ to output $x$, and $|p|$ denotes the length of program $p$ in bits.

This formulation embodies the principle that shorter programs (simpler explanations) should receive higher probability weight, mathematically formalizing [[Occam's razor]].

## Universal Distribution

The **universal distribution** $m(x)$ represents the algorithmic probability with respect to a reference universal machine:

$$m(x) = P_{U_{\text{ref}}}(x) = \sum_{p: U_{\text{ref}}(p) = x} 2^{-|p|}$$

Key properties include:

- **Universality**: For any other universal machine $V$, there exists a constant $c$ such that $m(x) \geq c \cdot P_V(x)$ for all $x$
- **Dominance**: $m(x)$ dominates all [[computable probability measures]] up to a multiplicative constant
- **Uncomputability**: $m(x)$ is not computable in general

## Solomonoff Induction

[[Solomonoff induction]] employs algorithmic probability for [[sequence prediction]]. Given an observed sequence $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$, the probability of the next symbol being $x_{n+1}$ is:

$$P(x_{n+1} | x_1, \ldots, x_n) = \frac{m(x_1, \ldots, x_n, x_{n+1})}{m(x_1, \ldots, x_n)}$$

This approach provides optimal predictive performance in the sense of minimizing expected [[Kullback-Leibler divergence]] from the true generating distribution.

## Mathematical Properties

### Convergence Guarantees

For any [[computable probability measure]] $\mu$ generating sequences, Solomonoff's predictor converges to $\mu$ with $\mu$-probability 1:

$$\lim_{n \to \infty} \left| P_m(x_{n+1} | x_1, \ldots, x_n) - \mu(x_{n+1} | x_1, \ldots, x_n) \right| = 0$$

### Loss Bounds

The expected [[logarithmic loss]] of Solomonoff's predictor is bounded by the [[Kolmogorov complexity]] of the true distribution:

$$\mathbb{E}_\mu \left[ \sum_{n=1}^N \log \frac{1}{P_m(x_n | x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1})} \right] \leq K(\mu) + O(\log N)$$

## Symbolic Representation

Let $\mathcal{A}$ denote the alphabet, $\mathcal{A}^*$ the set of finite strings, and $\mathcal{P}$ the set of programs. The algorithmic probability operator can be formalized as:

$$\mathbf{P}: \mathcal{A}^* \to [0,1]$$
$$\mathbf{P}(x) = \mathbf{W}(\{p \in \mathcal{P} : \mathbf{U}(p) = x\})$$

where $\mathbf{W}$ is the **universal weight function**:

$$\mathbf{W}(S) = \sum_{p \in S} 2^{-\ell(p)}$$

and $\ell: \mathcal{P} \to \mathbb{N}$ gives program length.

## Computational Considerations

### Approximation Methods

Since $m(x)$ is uncomputable, practical applications require approximation techniques:

1. **Finite approximation**: $m_t(x) = \sum_{|p| \leq t, U(p) = x} 2^{-|p|}$
2. **[[Levin search]]**: Systematically enumerate programs by increasing length
3. **[[Compression-based approximation]]**: Use practical compressors as proxies

### Time Complexity

The [[Levin complexity]] $Kt(x)$ incorporates both program length and runtime:

$$Kt(x) = \min_{p: U(p) = x} \{|p| + \log t(p)\}$$

where $t(p)$ is the runtime of program $p$.

## Philosophical Implications

Algorithmic probability provides a framework for understanding:

- **[[Inductive bias]]**: Preference for simple hypotheses emerges naturally
- **[[Universal induction]]**: Domain-independent learning principles
- **[[Computational epistemology]]**: Knowledge acquisition through compression
