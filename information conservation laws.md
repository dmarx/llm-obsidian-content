# Information Conservation Laws

## Fundamental Conservation Principles

[[Information conservation laws]] describe fundamental constraints on how information can be transformed and propagated through systems. These laws are analogous to conservation laws in physics but operate in the domain of information theory.

### Liouville's Theorem for Information

The information-theoretic analog of [[Liouville's theorem]] states that the [[phase space volume]] of an ensemble of states is conserved under deterministic evolution:

$\frac{d}{dt} \int_\Omega \rho(x,t) dx = 0$

where:
- $\rho(x,t)$ is the probability density in phase space
- $\Omega$ is the phase space volume

### Shannon's Information Conservation

For a closed system, the [[Shannon entropy]] remains constant under reversible transformations:

$H(X) = -\sum_i p_i \log p_i = \text{constant}$

This holds true for any [[bijective mapping]] of the system states.

## Quantum Information Conservation

### No-Cloning Theorem

The [[quantum no-cloning theorem]] represents a fundamental conservation law stating that arbitrary quantum states cannot be perfectly copied. Mathematically:

$\nexists U: |\psi\rangle|0\rangle \rightarrow |\psi\rangle|\psi\rangle$

for all input states $|\psi\rangle$, where $U$ is a unitary operator.

### Holographic Principle

The [[holographic principle]] suggests a fundamental bound on information content:

$I_{max} \leq \frac{A}{4l_p^2}$

where:
- $A$ is the bounding area
- $l_p$ is the Planck length

## Information Processing Constraints

### Landauer's Principle

[[Landauer's principle]] establishes a fundamental connection between information erasure and thermodynamics:

$\Delta S \geq k_B \ln(2) \cdot \text{bits erased}$

where:
- $\Delta S$ is the entropy increase
- $k_B$ is Boltzmann's constant

### Data Processing Inequality

The [[data processing inequality]] states that information cannot be increased through processing:

$I(X;Y) \geq I(X;f(Y))$

for any function $f$, where $I(X;Y)$ is the mutual information.

## Conservation in Dynamic Systems

### Fisher Information Conservation

For continuous parameters, [[Fisher information]] satisfies:

$\int \frac{1}{p(x;\theta)} \left(\frac{\partial p(x;\theta)}{\partial \theta}\right)^2 dx = \text{constant}$

under certain transformations.

### Kolmogorov-Sinai Entropy Conservation

In [[dynamical systems]], the [[Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy]] is conserved:

$h_{KS} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n} H(X_1, ..., X_n)$

for ergodic systems.

## Applications

1. [[Error Correction Coding]]
2. [[Quantum Computing]]
3. [[Cryptographic Protocols]]
4. [[Information Thermodynamics]]

## Theoretical Implications

### Bounds on Information Processing

These conservation laws impose fundamental limits on:
- [[Computational Complexity]]
- [[Communication Capacity]]
- [[Error Correction Capabilities]]

### Connection to Physical Laws

The deep relationship between information conservation and physical conservation laws suggests:
- [[Information-Energy Equivalence]]
- [[Quantum Information Principles]]
- [[Thermodynamic Information Bounds]]

These conservation principles continue to guide research in [[quantum computing]], [[information theory]], and [[complex systems analysis]].
