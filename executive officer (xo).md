**USER**

executive officer (XO)


**ASSISTANT**

In a military or paramilitary organization, the **Executive Officer (XO)** is the second-in-command and is responsible for managing day-to-day operations, ensuring the commander's directives are executed efficiently, and overseeing staff functions. The role of an XO varies depending on the branch of service, unit size, and specific organizational structure.

### **General Responsibilities**
- Acts as the primary advisor to the commander (Commanding Officer, CO)
- Implements policies, plans, and operational directives
- Supervises staff officers and ensures coordination across departments
- Assumes command in the absence of the CO
- Ensures discipline, training, and readiness of personnel
- Manages administrative functions and logistics

### **By Military Branch**
#### **U.S. Navy**
- The XO is the second-in-command of a ship, squadron, or shore installation.
- On larger ships (e.g., aircraft carriers), the XO focuses on personnel, discipline, and training, while department heads report directly to the CO.
- Typically progresses to command (CO) after serving as XO.

#### **U.S. Army / Marine Corps**
- The XO is the second-in-command of a battalion, company, or brigade.
- At the company level, the XO ensures logistics and administrative matters are handled so that the company commander (CO) can focus on tactics.
- At higher levels, the XO is critical for planning and staff coordination.

#### **U.S. Air Force / Space Force**
- The XO may be an administrative aide to a high-ranking officer or serve in a role similar to other branches, depending on the unit structure.

### **Corporate and Civilian Use**
In civilian organizations, "XO" is sometimes used informally to refer to the **Chief Operating Officer (COO)** or other high-ranking executives responsible for daily operations.
