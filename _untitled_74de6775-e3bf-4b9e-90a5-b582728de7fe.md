**ASSISTANT**

In contemporary philosophy of mind, the delineation of system boundaries and components has been influenced by several significant developments over the last two decades. These developments reflect broader shifts towards understanding the mind in a more interconnected, less individualistic manner, challenging traditional notions of mental processes as being solely within the brain. Here, I'll outline key areas where recent philosophical inquiry has focused on the boundaries and components of cognitive systems.

### Embedded and Embodied Cognition

The theories of embedded and embodied cognition argue against the traditional view that cognitive processes are confined within the boundaries of the skull. Instead, these perspectives propose that cognitive systems extend into the body and the environment.

- **Embedded Cognition** emphasizes that cognitive processes depend heavily on the external environment. This view suggests that tools, symbols, and other environmental factors play integral roles in cognitive processing, effectively blurring the boundaries between the mind and the external world.
  
- **Embodied Cognition** goes further by arguing that cognition is deeply influenced by the body's interactions with its environment. This perspective highlights the role of sensorimotor capacities in shaping cognitive processes, suggesting a system boundary that encompasses both the body and its situated context.

### Enactivism

Enactivism presents a radical rethinking of cognition that emphasizes the co-constitutive relationship between an organism and its environment. It argues that cognitive processes emerge from the dynamic interactions between an agent and its environment, leading to a view of mind as enacted through these interactions rather than pre-existing in a delimited neural substrate.

- This perspective challenges clear-cut ontological and epistemological boundaries between the mind, body, and world, proposing instead that cognition is a process of bringing forth meaning through engagement with the world. Enactivism posits a deeply interconnected system where the delineation of boundaries is fluid and context-dependent.

### Extended Mind Theory

The Extended Mind Thesis (EMT), proposed by Clark and Chalmers in the late 1990s and further developed in subsequent years, argues that cognitive processes can extend beyond the brain to include external devices and environmental features, provided that these external elements play a significant, reliable role in the individual's cognitive life.

- EMT challenges traditional ontological assumptions about the boundaries of the cognitive system, suggesting that objects in the environment can become parts of the cognitive process itself if they are sufficiently integrated into the agent's cognitive routines.
  
- This thesis has sparked debates about the criteria for including external components within the cognitive system's boundaries, focusing on issues of coupling, reliability, and information flow between the agent and external elements.

### 4E Cognition

Building on these theories, the framework of 4E cognition (embodied, embedded, enactive, and extended) represents a comprehensive shift towards viewing cognition as a process that transcends the brain-body boundary, incorporating elements of the environment and the agent's interactions with it.

- This approach has encouraged philosophers to explore new ways of conceptualizing system boundaries that account for the dynamic, interactive nature of cognitive processes. The 4E framework challenges the epistemological boundaries drawn by traditional cognitive science and philosophy of mind, advocating for a more integrated understanding of cognition.

### Information Integration and Network Theories

Recent developments in neuroscience, such as information integration theory (IIT) and network theories of brain function, have influenced philosophical discussions about the boundaries and components of cognitive systems. These theories suggest that consciousness and cognitive processes emerge from the integrated information processing within networks that span various brain regions.

- Philosophical interpretations of these theories often grapple with questions about the physical substrates of cognition, the role of neural plasticity in defining system boundaries, and how information integration can occur across distributed networks. These discussions intersect with philosophical inquiries about the nature of consciousness and its relation to the material world.

### Conclusion

In the last 20 years, contemporary philosophy of mind has increasingly questioned and redefined the boundaries and components of cognitive systems. Through the lenses of embedded, embodied, enactive, and extended cognition, as well as advances in understanding brain networks, philosophers have challenged traditional views of cognition as a brain-bound process. These developments reflect a broader move towards a more holistic, interconnected understanding of mind, emphasizing the importance of bodily and environmental interactions in cognitive processes.
