### Generalized Definitions for "Agent" and "Environment" in Hierarchical Systems

To capture the complexity and nested nature of agents and environments, we can define agents as systems composed of subcomponents that interact within an internal environment. This approach recognizes that agents themselves can be complex systems with their own internal dynamics, and these subcomponents can also be considered agents at a lower hierarchical level.

#### Agent

**Definition**: An agent is a composite system consisting of subcomponents (which can themselves be agents) that interact within an internal environment. This internal environment is influenced by the external environment, but the agent maintains a degree of autonomy in its interactions with the external environment.

**Characteristics of an Agent**:
1. **Hierarchical Structure**: Composed of subcomponents that interact within an internal environment.
2. **Autonomy**: The composite system acts as a single autonomous entity in the external environment.
3. **Internal Interactions**: Subcomponents interact according to rules and constraints of the internal environment.
4. **Adaptation and Decision-Making**: Capable of adapting and making decisions based on both internal dynamics and external stimuli.
5. **Goal-Oriented Behavior**: Acts to achieve specific objectives at the composite system level, which may align or conflict with subcomponent goals.

**Formal Representation**:
- Let $A$ be a set of agents in a system.
- An agent $a_i \in A$ is composed of subcomponents $a_{i,j}$ and has an internal environment $E_i$.

$$
a_i = \{S_i, E_i, \pi_i\}
$$

where:
- $S_i$: Set of subcomponents $\{a_{i,1}, a_{i,2}, \ldots, a_{i,n}\}$.
- $E_i$: Internal environment within which subcomponents $S_i$ interact.
- $\pi_i$: Policy or strategy guiding the agent's actions in the external environment.

#### Subcomponent

**Definition**: A subcomponent is an element within an agent that interacts with other subcomponents within the internal environment of the agent. Subcomponents can themselves be considered agents at a lower hierarchical level.

**Characteristics of a Subcomponent**:
1. **Internal Interactions**: Engages with other subcomponents within the internal environment.
2. **Autonomy**: Has a degree of autonomy but operates within the constraints of the internal environment.
3. **Adaptation**: Capable of adapting based on interactions with other subcomponents and internal environment conditions.
4. **Contributes to Agent Goals**: Its behavior contributes to the overall objectives of the composite agent.

**Formal Representation**:
- Let $S_i$ be the set of subcomponents within agent $a_i$.
- A subcomponent $a_{i,j} \in S_i$ can be described by its state $s_{i,j}(t)$ and actions $act_{i,j}$.

$$
a_{i,j} = \{s_{i,j}(t), act_{i,j}, \pi_{i,j}\}
$$

where:
- $s_{i,j}(t)$: State of subcomponent $j$ at time $t$.
- $act_{i,j}$: Set of actions available to subcomponent $j$.
- $\pi_{i,j}$: Policy or strategy guiding the subcomponent's actions.

#### Environment

**Definition**: The environment is the external context within which agents exist and operate. It provides the conditions, resources, constraints, and stimuli that influence the behavior and interactions of agents. For an agent, the environment includes both external and internal contexts.

**Characteristics of the Environment**:
1. **External Context**: The broader space within which agents interact and operate.
2. **Internal Environment**: The specific context within an agent where subcomponents interact.
3. **Resources and Constraints**: Provides resources necessary for agents and imposes constraints on their actions.
4. **Dynamic**: Changes over time due to agents' actions and other external factors.

**Formal Representation**:
- Let $E$ be the external environment.
- The environment $E$ can be described by its state $e(t)$ at time $t$ and conditions $cond$.

$$
E = \{e(t), cond\}
$$

where:
- $e(t)$: State of the environment at time $t$.
- $cond$: Conditions and resources provided by the environment.

### Interaction Dynamics

To model the interactions between agents, subcomponents, and the environment, we consider the following equations:

1. **Agent Dynamics**:
   $$
   \frac{ds_i(t)}{dt} = f_i(s_i(t), act_i, e(t), cond, E_i)
   $$

   where $f_i$ describes how the state of agent $i$ evolves based on its actions, the external environment, and its internal environment.

2. **Subcomponent Dynamics**:
   $$
   \frac{ds_{i,j}(t)}{dt} = g_{i,j}(s_{i,j}(t), act_{i,j}, E_i)
   $$

   where $g_{i,j}$ describes how the state of subcomponent $j$ within agent $i$ evolves based on internal actions and interactions within the internal environment $E_i$.

3. **Environment Dynamics**:
   $$
   \frac{de(t)}{dt} = h(e(t), \{act_i\})
   $$

   where $h$ describes how the external environment evolves based on the aggregate actions of agents.

### Examples

- **Economic System**: 
  - **Agent**: A corporation composed of various departments (subcomponents) interacting within the corporate structure (internal environment).
  - **Subcomponent**: Departments making decisions and adapting within the corporate structure.
  - **Environment**: The market conditions, regulations, and resources available externally.

- **Ecological System**: 
  - **Agent**: A colony of bees, with individual bees as subcomponents.
  - **Subcomponent**: Individual bees interacting within the hive.
  - **Environment**: The habitat, climate conditions, and resources available externally.

### Conclusion

By defining agents as hierarchical systems composed of subcomponents that interact within an internal environment, we capture the nested nature of complex adaptive systems. This approach allows us to analyze the dynamics and interactions at multiple levels, providing a comprehensive understanding of how systems evolve, adapt, and maintain stability.
