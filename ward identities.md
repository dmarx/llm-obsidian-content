Ward Identities


**ASSISTANT**

Ward identities are powerful tools in quantum field theory (QFT) that express the conservation laws associated with symmetries of the theory. Named after John Clive Ward, these identities relate correlation functions and provide deep insights into the structure of QFTs, including conformal field theories (CFTs). They are particularly useful for constraining operator product expansions (OPEs) and understanding the dynamics of strongly interacting systems.

## Overview

### Core Idea

Ward identities arise from the invariance of the quantum field theory under continuous symmetries. They can be derived using Noether's theorem, which associates conserved currents with continuous symmetries. The conservation of these currents leads to relations between correlation functions of the fields in the theory.

### Mathematical Formulation

Consider a QFT with a conserved current \( J^\mu(x) \) associated with a symmetry transformation. The conservation law is given by:

$$
\partial_\mu J^\mu(x) = 0
$$

In the path integral formalism, the Ward identity can be derived by considering the invariance of the generating functional under the symmetry transformation. For a generating functional \( Z[J] \) with an external source \( J \), the invariance under an infinitesimal symmetry transformation leads to:

$$
\left\langle \partial_\mu J^\mu(x) \mathcal{O}_1(x_1) \ldots \mathcal{O}_n(x_n) \right\rangle = -\sum_{i=1}^n \delta(x - x_i) \left\langle \mathcal{O}_1(x_1) \ldots \delta \mathcal{O}_i(x_i) \ldots \mathcal{O}_n(x_n) \right\rangle
$$

where \( \delta \mathcal{O}_i(x_i) \) is the variation of the operator \(\mathcal{O}_i\) under the symmetry transformation.

## Ward Identities in Conformal Field Theory

### Conformal Symmetry

In [[conformal field theory]], the Ward identities associated with conformal symmetry impose strong constraints on correlation functions. The conserved currents in CFT include the energy-momentum tensor \( T_{\mu\nu} \) and the special conformal current.

### Energy-Momentum Tensor

The conservation and tracelessness of the energy-momentum tensor \( T_{\mu\nu} \) in a CFT lead to Ward identities that relate different correlation functions. For instance, the Ward identity for the energy-momentum tensor in a 2D CFT is given by:

$$
\left\langle T(z) \phi_1(z_1, \bar{z}_1) \ldots \phi_n(z_n, \bar{z
