prospect theory


**ASSISTANT**

**Prospect Theory** is a behavioral economic theory developed by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in 1979, which describes how people make decisions under conditions of risk and uncertainty. The theory challenges the traditional expected utility theory by demonstrating that people value potential gains and losses differently, leading to systematic deviations from rational decision-making.

### Key Concepts of Prospect Theory

1. **Value Function**:
   - The value function is defined on deviations from a reference point (usually the status quo), rather than on the final wealth. It is typically concave for gains (reflecting risk aversion) and convex for losses (reflecting risk-seeking behavior), and it is steeper for losses than for gains, illustrating loss aversion.

2. **Loss Aversion**:
   - People experience losses more intensely than gains of the same size. This means that losing $100 feels more painful than gaining $100 feels pleasurable. This asymmetry leads individuals to weigh losses more heavily than gains when making decisions.

3. **Reference Dependence**:
   - Choices are evaluated relative to a reference point, which is often the current state or an expected outcome. Changes from this reference point are perceived as gains or losses, and the framing of outcomes can significantly impact decision-making.

4. **Probability Weighting**:
   - People tend to overestimate the probability of rare events and underestimate the probability of moderate and high-probability events. The weighting function is not linear; instead, it overweights small probabilities and underweights large probabilities, affecting how individuals perceive and act on risk.

5. **Certainty Effect**:
   - Individuals disproportionately favor outcomes that are certain compared to those that are merely probable. This effect leads to risk aversion in choices involving sure gains and risk-seeking in choices involving sure losses.

### The Value Function and Weighting Function

1. **Value Function**:
   - The value function \(v(x)\) is S-shaped and asymmetrical. It is concave for gains (\(x > 0\)) and convex for losses (\(x < 0\)), and it is steeper for losses than for gains.
   $$ v(x) = \begin{cases} 
   x^\alpha & \text{if } x \geq 0 \\
   -\lambda (-x)^\beta & \text{if } x < 0 
   \end{cases} $$
   where \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are typically less than 1, indicating diminishing sensitivity, and \(\lambda\) represents loss aversion, typically greater than 1.

2. **Probability Weighting Function**:
   - The weighting function \( \pi(p) \) transforms actual probabilities into decision weights. It is often inverse S-shaped, reflecting the overestimation of small probabilities and underestimation of large probabilities.
   $$ \pi(p) = \frac{p^\gamma}{(p^\gamma + (1 - p)^\gamma)^{1/\gamma}} $$
   where \(\gamma\) reflects the curvature of the weighting function.

### Key Findings and Implications

1. **Framing Effects**:
   - The way choices are framed (as gains or losses) can significantly affect decisions. For example, people might react differently to a treatment with a "90% survival rate" versus a "10% mortality rate," even though they are statistically identical.

2. **Endowment Effect**:
   - People assign more value to objects simply because they own them, illustrating loss aversion. This effect explains why sellers often ask for higher prices than buyers are willing to pay.

3. **Mental Accounting**:
   - Individuals categorize and treat money differently depending on its origin, intended use, or other factors, leading to inconsistent decision-making that deviates from traditional economic theory.

4. **Disposition Effect**:
   - Investors are more likely to sell assets that have gained value while holding on to assets that have lost value, contrary to rational investment strategies.

### Applications of Prospect Theory

1. **Behavioral Finance**:
   - Understanding investor behavior, market anomalies, and asset pricing by incorporating psychological factors such as overreaction to news and loss aversion.

2. **Marketing and Consumer Behavior**:
   - Designing pricing strategies, promotions, and product presentations that leverage framing effects and loss aversion to influence consumer choices.

3. **Public Policy and Health**:
   - Structuring policies and interventions that consider how people perceive risks and benefits. For example, framing health messages to highlight potential losses (diseases prevented) rather than gains (health benefits).

4. **Negotiation and Conflict Resolution**:
   - Applying insights into how parties perceive gains and losses can help in designing negotiation strategies and resolving conflicts more effectively.

### Criticisms and Limitations

1. **Descriptive, Not Normative**:
   - Prospect theory describes how people actually behave rather than prescribing how they should behave to maximize utility.

2. **Complexity in Application**:
   - While the theory provides a better fit for observed behaviors than traditional models, it can be complex to apply in practical decision-making scenarios due to its multiple parameters and functions.

3. **Evolution Over Time**:
   - The reference point can change over time, making it difficult to predict future decision-making based on past behavior consistently.

### Conclusion

Prospect Theory provides a nuanced understanding of decision-making under risk and uncertainty, highlighting the importance of psychological factors such as loss aversion, reference dependence, and probability weighting. By challenging traditional economic assumptions of rationality, it offers valuable insights for fields ranging from finance and marketing to public policy and health.
