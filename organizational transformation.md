### Organizational Transformation

**Organizational transformation** refers to the comprehensive process of making fundamental changes to an organization’s structure, culture, strategy, or operations to achieve long-term goals and adapt to dynamic environments. Unlike incremental improvements, transformation involves deep, systemic change aimed at ensuring sustainability, competitiveness, and resilience in the face of challenges such as technological advances, market shifts, or societal expectations.

### Key Drivers of Organizational Transformation

1. **Technological Change**
   - Digital transformation: Integration of technologies like [[AI]], [[machine learning]], [[cloud computing]], and [[IoT]] into operations.
   - Example: Automating workflows or adopting data-driven decision-making systems.

2. **Market Dynamics**
   - Rapidly changing customer preferences, globalization, and competition necessitate transformation.
   - Example: Transitioning from a product-centric to a customer-centric business model.
