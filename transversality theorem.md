Transversality Theorem


**ASSISTANT**

The **Transversality Theorem** is a fundamental result in [[differential topology]] that provides conditions under which smooth maps intersect submanifolds transversely. This theorem has significant implications in the study of differentiable manifolds, particularly in understanding the generic properties of smooth maps and their intersections.

### Key Concepts

1. **Transversality**: A smooth map \(f: M \to N\) is said to be transverse to a submanifold \(S \subseteq N\) at a point \(p \in M\) if the image of the differential \(df_p(T_pM)\) plus the tangent space \(T_{f(p)}S\) spans the tangent space \(T_{f(p)}N\):
   $$
   df_p(T_pM) + T_{f(p)}S = T_{f(p)}N.
   ```

2. **Transverse Intersection**: If \(f\) is transverse to \(S\), the preimage \(f^{-1}(S)\) is a submanifold of \(M\) with dimension \(\dim(M) - \dim(N) + \dim(S)\). This means that the intersection is "generic" and happens in the most typical way.

### Statement of the Transversality Theorem

Let \(f: M \to N\) be a smooth map between smooth manifolds \(M\) and \(N\), and let \(S\) be a submanifold of \(N\). The Transversality Theorem states:

1. If \(f\) is transverse to \(S\), then \(f^{-1}(S)\) is a submanifold of \(M\) with dimension \(\dim(M) - \dim(N) + \dim(S)\).
2. The set of smooth maps transverse to \(S\) is dense in the space of all smooth maps from \(M\) to \(N\).

### Implications

1. **Generic Properties**: The theorem implies that transverse maps are generic, meaning that any smooth map can be approximated arbitrarily closely by a map that is transverse to a given submanifold.
2. **Stable Intersections**: Transversality ensures that intersections between manifolds are stable under small perturbations, leading to well-behaved geometric and topological properties.
3. **Intersection Theory**: In algebraic topology and geometry, transverse intersections allow for a precise and clean definition of intersection numbers and other invariants.

### Applications

1. **Morse Theory**: In Morse theory, transversality is used to ensure that Morse functions (smooth functions with non-degenerate critical points) are generic.
2. **Singularity Theory**: Transversality is used to study the local behavior of maps near singularities, ensuring that singularities are well-behaved.
3. **Differential Topology**: Used in proving other fundamental results such as the existence of smooth structures on manifolds and in the classification of manifolds.

### Example

Consider the map \(f: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2\) defined by \(f(x, y) = (x^2, y^2)\). Let \(S = \{(1, 1)\}\) be a submanifold of \(\mathbb{R}^2\). 

- The differential \(df_{(x, y)}\) is given by the Jacobian matrix:
  $$
  df_{(x, y)} = \begin{pmatrix}
  2x & 0 \\
  0 & 2y
  \end{pmatrix}.
  ```

- To check transversality, we need to see if \(df_{(x, y)}(\mathbb{R}^2) + T_{(1,1)}S = \mathbb{R}^2\). Since \(T_{(1,1)}S = \{0\}\) (the tangent space at a point is trivial), we only need \(df_{(x, y)}\) to span \(\mathbb{R}^2\).

- For \(f\) to be transverse to \(S\), the rank of \(df_{(x, y)}\) must be 2. However, this is not always the case for the given \(f\), indicating that \(f\) is not transverse to \(S\) at all points. 

### Proof Outline

The proof of the Transversality Theorem involves several advanced concepts and techniques:

1. **Local Charts**: Use local coordinate charts to reduce the problem to a local one where \(M\) and \(N\) are represented by open subsets of \(\mathbb{R}^m\) and \(\mathbb{R}^n\), respectively.

2. **Transversality Condition**: Show that for a given smooth map \(f: M \to N\), one can perturb \(f\) slightly to make it transverse to \(S\).

3. **Density Argument**: Use the fact that transverse maps form an open dense subset in the space of all smooth maps, which involves showing that any smooth map can be approximated arbitrarily closely by a transverse map.

### Conclusion

The Transversality Theorem is a powerful tool in [[differential topology]] that ensures that intersections of manifolds can be made to happen in a generic, stable way. It has wide-ranging applications in geometry, topology, and mathematical physics. Understanding and applying this theorem allows for the rigorous study of manifold intersections, smooth structures, and related topological properties.
