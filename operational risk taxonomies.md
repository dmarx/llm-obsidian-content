### Operational Risk Taxonomies

Operational risk taxonomies categorize risks associated with the day-to-day operations of an organization. These taxonomies help in systematically identifying, assessing, and managing risks to ensure smooth and efficient operations.

#### Categories of Operational Risks

   - **Process Failures**: Risks due to inadequacies in internal processes, such as incorrect data entry or processing errors.
   - **Procedural Non-Compliance**: Risks stemming from failure to adhere to established procedures or protocols.

2. **People Risks**:
   - **Human Error**: Risks caused by mistakes or negligence by employees.
   - **Skills and Training**: Risks due to insufficient skills, training, or experience of personnel.

3. **Systems Risks**:
   - **IT Failures**: Risks related to hardware, software, or network failures.
   - **Cybersecurity**: Risks from cyber attacks, data breaches, or unauthorized access.

4. **External Risks**:
   - **Supplier Risks**: Risks arising from supplier failures, such as delays or quality issues.
   - **Regulatory Changes**: Risks due to changes in laws, regulations, or compliance requirements.

5. **Event Risks**:
   - **Natural Disasters**: Risks from events like earthquakes, floods, or hurricanes.
   - **Man-Made Disasters**: Risks from events such as terrorism, vandalism, or accidents.

#### Benefits of Operational Risk Taxonomies
