# Autotelic

An [[autotelic]] process or activity is one that contains its own purpose or end within itself, derived from the Greek "auto-" (self) and "telos" (end, purpose). In the context of cognitive science and philosophy of mind, autotelic systems demonstrate [[self-organizing]] properties and exhibit [[intrinsic motivation]].

## Mathematical Formalization

We can model autotelic systems using the framework of [[dynamical systems theory]]. Let's define an autotelic system S as:

S = (X, F, G)

Where:
- X is the state space
- F: X → X is the state transition function
- G: X → ℝ is an intrinsic value function

The key property of an autotelic system is that G emerges from the dynamics of F rather than being externally imposed. This can be formalized through the concept of [[structural stability]]:

∃ε > 0 such that ∀h where ||h - F|| < ε:
G(h(x)) ≈ G(F(x))

## Properties

Key characteristics of autotelic processes include:

1. [[Self-containment]]: The system's objectives arise from its own dynamics rather than external rewards
2. [[Operational closure]]: The system's operations reference and reinforce each other in a closed loop
3. [[Homeostatic regulation]]: The system maintains stability through internal feedback mechanisms
4. [[Emergent teleology]]: Purpose or direction emerges from the system's organization rather than being externally prescribed

## Applications

The concept of autotelicity has important implications for:

- [[Artificial consciousness]] research, particularly in developing systems with intrinsic rather than programmed goals
- [[Flow state]] psychology, where autotelic experiences characterize optimal human performance
- [[Autonomous learning]] systems that develop their own learning objectives
- [[Autopoiesis]] in biological and artificial systems
