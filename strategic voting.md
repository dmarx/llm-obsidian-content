### Strategic Voting

Strategic voting, also known as tactical voting, occurs when voters do not vote for their sincere or most preferred candidate, but rather for a less preferred candidate who has a better chance of winning or influencing the outcome. Voters engage in strategic voting to maximize their utility or influence the election results in a way that aligns more closely with their preferences.

### Key Concepts

1. **Sincere Voting**: Voting for the candidate who is the voter's genuine first choice.
2. **Strategic Voting**: Voting for a candidate other than the voter's first choice to influence the election outcome in a more favorable direction.
3. **Spoiler Effect**: When a minor candidate’s presence in an election changes the outcome, often causing the defeat of a candidate similar to the minor one.
4. **Vote Splitting**: When votes for similar candidates are divided among them, potentially leading to the election of a less preferred candidate.

### Types of Strategic Voting

#### 1. Compromising

Voters select a less preferred but more viable candidate to prevent an undesirable candidate from winning.

**Example**: In a three-candidate election (A, B, C), if a voter prefers A but believes A has little chance of winning, they may vote for B (their second choice) to prevent C (their least preferred candidate) from winning.

#### 2. Burying

Voters rank a strong rival lower than their true preference to improve the chances of their preferred candidate.

**Example**: In a ranked choice voting system, a voter who prefers candidate A but sees B as a strong competitor might rank B last, even if B is genuinely their second choice, to increase A’s chances of winning.

#### 3. Bullet Voting

Voters select only their top choice, even if they have the option to rank multiple candidates, to maximize the impact of their vote.

**Example**: In a system that allows ranking of candidates, a voter may choose to rank only their top choice to avoid helping other candidates gain relative standing.

### Strategic Voting in Different Voting Systems

#### 1. Plurality Voting

**Description**: Voters select one candidate, and the candidate with the most votes wins.

**Strategic Voting**: Voters often vote for the "lesser of two evils" rather than their true favorite if their favorite is unlikely to win.

**Example**: In a U.S. presidential election, a voter who prefers a third-party candidate may vote for a major party candidate to avoid "wasting" their vote.

#### 2. Ranked Choice Voting (Instant Runoff Voting)

**Description**: Voters rank candidates in order of preference. The candidate with the fewest first-choice votes is eliminated, and votes are transferred until one candidate has a majority.

**Strategic Voting**: Voters might rank a less preferred but more viable candidate higher to avoid their least preferred candidate from winning.

**Example**: A voter who prefers candidate A but thinks A will be eliminated early might rank B first to prevent C from winning.

#### 3. Borda Count

**Description**: Voters rank candidates, and points are assigned based on the position in the ranking. The candidate with the highest total points wins.

**Strategic Voting**: Voters may rank a strong competitor lower to reduce their points and improve their preferred candidate's chances.

**Example**: A voter who prefers candidate A might rank A first and rank a strong competitor (B) lower than their true preference.

#### 4. Approval Voting

**Description**: Voters can vote for (approve) as many candidates as they like. The candidate with the most approvals wins.

**Strategic Voting**: Voters might approve only the most viable candidates to maximize the impact of their vote.

**Example**: A voter who likes candidates A and B equally but believes B has a better chance of winning might approve only B to avoid splitting the vote.

#### 5. Single Transferable Vote (STV)

**Description**: A proportional representation system where voters rank candidates. Candidates are elected based on achieving a quota of votes, and surplus votes are transferred according to preferences.

**Strategic Voting**: Voters might rank viable candidates higher and less viable ones lower to influence the distribution of surplus votes.

**Example**: In an election for multiple seats, a voter might rank a popular candidate first and a less popular but preferred candidate second to ensure the transfer of surplus votes.

### Implications of Strategic Voting

1. **Distortion of Preferences**: Strategic voting can distort the true preferences of the electorate, leading to outcomes that do not accurately reflect voter intentions.
2. **Reduced Voter Satisfaction**: When voters cannot vote sincerely, they may feel dissatisfied with the election process and its outcomes.
3. **Potential for Gaming the System**: Strategic voting opens the possibility for manipulation, where voters or parties might attempt to game the system to achieve more favorable outcomes.

### Mitigating Strategic Voting

1. **Designing Robust Voting Systems**: Systems like the Condorcet method or the Schulze method can reduce the incentives for strategic voting by focusing on pairwise comparisons.
2. **Educational Campaigns**: Educating voters about the implications of strategic voting and how different systems work can help reduce its prevalence.
3. **Increasing Awareness**: Making voters aware of how strategic voting impacts election outcomes can lead to more sincere voting behavior.

### Conclusion

Strategic voting is a significant phenomenon in electoral systems, driven by voters' desire to influence outcomes in a way that aligns more closely with their preferences. While it can lead to suboptimal and distorted election results, understanding its mechanics and implications is crucial for designing [[voting systems]] that minimize strategic behavior and better reflect the true preferences of the electorate. Addressing strategic voting involves both systemic changes and voter education to ensure fair and representative outcomes.
