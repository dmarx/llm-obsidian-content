title: training dynamics energy-information tradeoffs in large language models
---

**USER**

training an LLM requires a minimum amount of watts. given some dataset size, the wattage will have some kind of proportion to the size of the dataset, assuming something like a chinchilla optimal sized model or whatever. there's an interesting tradeoff in this system: we can potentially increase the per GPU throughput (tokens/s) by increasing the global batch size. increasing the global batch size measurably reduces the per-sample efficiency. the loss decreases less per token seen at higher batch size than lower. but the tradeoff is we gain energy efficiency: given some loss that is achievable under either regime, we can achieve that loss value faster if we can maintain above some threshold throughput.

Clearly, there is a literal "information <--> energy tradeoff" of some kind at play here. A relationship we can model using the laws of physics and information theory.

# Training Dynamics: Energy-Information Tradeoffs in Large Language Models

## Fundamental Relationships

The training of [[Large Language Models]] represents a concrete manifestation of energy-information tradeoffs, governed by both physical and computational constraints. This system can be formally modeled through several interconnected components.

## Core Parameters

Let's define the key quantities:

- D: Dataset size in tokens
- W: Total energy consumption in watts
- B: [[Global batch size]]
- T: Throughput in tokens/second
- L: Loss value
- E: Training efficiency (loss reduction per token)

## Efficiency Relations

The [[per-sample efficiency]] E can be modeled as a decreasing function of batch size:

E(B) = α·B^(-β)

Where:
- α represents base efficiency
- β ∈ (0,1) represents the [[batch size scaling exponent]]

## Throughput Scaling

The relationship between throughput and batch size typically follows:

T(B) = T₀·min(1, B/B_max)^γ

Where:
- T₀ is theoretical maximum throughput
- B_max is hardware-determined maximum batch size
- γ represents [[hardware utilization efficiency]]

## Energy-Time Tradeoff

The total energy consumption to reach a target loss L* can be expressed as:

W_total = W_base · Time = W_base · (L₀ - L*)/E(B)·T(B)

Where:
- W_base represents baseline power consumption
- L₀ is initial loss
- Time is training duration

## Information Processing Rate

The [[effective information processing rate]] I can be defined as:

I = E(B)·T(B)

This represents the rate at which the model incorporates information from the training data into its parameters.

## Optimization Problem

The training process can be formulated as an optimization problem:

minimize W_total
subject to:
- L ≤ L* (target loss constraint)
- B ≤ B_max (hardware constraint)
- T(B) ≥ T_min (minimum throughput requirement)

## Theoretical Bounds

### Minimum Energy Requirement

The [[theoretical minimum energy]] E_min for training can be derived from [[Landauer's principle]]:

E_min = k_B·T·ln(2)·N_params·H_data

Where:
- N_params is the number of model parameters
- H_data is the entropy of the training data
- T is temperature
- k_B is Boltzmann's constant

### Practical Energy Consumption

Actual energy consumption exceeds the theoretical minimum by several orders of magnitude:

E_practical = η·E_min

Where η represents the [[practical efficiency factor]], typically 10⁶-10⁹ in current systems.

## Batch Size Optimization

The optimal batch size B* can be found where:

∂W_total/∂B = 0

This yields:

B* = (β·γ·W_base/T₀)^(1/(γ-β))

## System Dynamics

The [[training dynamics]] can be described by the differential equation:

dL/dt = -E(B)·T(B)·L

This equation captures the fundamental tradeoff between:
1. Higher batch sizes increasing throughput
2. Lower batch sizes improving per-sample efficiency

## Practical Implications

1. [[Energy-Optimal Training]]: Finding B* that minimizes total energy consumption
2. [[Time-Optimal Training]]: Finding B* that minimizes training time
3. [[Cost-Optimal Training]]: Finding B* that minimizes monetary cost (considering both energy and compute costs)

## Future Research Directions

1. [[Adaptive Batch Sizing]]: Dynamically adjusting B during training
2. [[Hardware-Aware Optimization]]: Incorporating specific hardware characteristics
3. [[Energy-Efficient Architecture Search]]: Designing model architectures optimized for energy efficiency
4. [[Quantum-Inspired Training]]: Exploring quantum algorithms for improved energy efficiency

The relationship between batch size, energy consumption, and training efficiency represents a concrete example of fundamental physical limits on information processing, with practical implications for ML system design.
