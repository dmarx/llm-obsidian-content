**ASSISTANT**

*Wright's Law*, also known as the *Learning Curve* or *Experience Curve*, is an empirical model used to describe the relationship between the cumulative production of a product and the reduction in its cost. The law states that for every cumulative doubling of units produced, the cost per unit decreases by a consistent percentage. This relationship is particularly relevant in industries characterized by complex manufacturing processes, where increased production leads to learning, process improvements, and economies of scale.

### Formal Definition

Wright's Law can be mathematically expressed as:

$$
C_n = C_1 \cdot n^{\log_2(1 - b)}
$$

Where:
- $C_n$ = Cost of the $n$-th unit produced.
- $C_1$ = Cost of the first unit produced.
- $n$ = Cumulative number of units produced.
- $b$ = Learning rate, expressed as a percentage. It represents the cost reduction factor when cumulative production doubles.

Alternatively, this can be expressed in logarithmic form for linearity:

$$
\log(C_n) = \log(C_1) + \log_2(1 - b) \cdot \log(n)
$$

### Components Explained

1. **Initial Cost ($C_1$)**: The cost of producing the very first unit, often high due to initial inefficiencies, setup costs, and lack
