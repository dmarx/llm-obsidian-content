# Extended Depth Chain - Computational Complexity Thread
*From fundamentals to theoretical frontiers*

## Foundation to Early Specialization
δ:1 [[Introduction to Algorithms]]
- Successor: [[Time Complexity]] (δ:2)

δ:2 [[Time Complexity]]
- Predecessor: [[Introduction to Algorithms]] (δ:1)
- Successor: [[Complexity Classes]] (δ:3)

δ:3 [[Complexity Classes]]
- Predecessor: [[Time Complexity]] (δ:2)
- Successor: [[Descriptional Complexity]] (δ:4)

## Mid-Level Specialization
δ:4 [[Descriptional Complexity]]
- Predecessor: [[Complexity Classes]] (δ:3)
- Successor: [[Implicit Complexity Theory]] (δ:5)

δ:5 [[Implicit Complexity Theory]]
- Predecessor: [[Descriptional Complexity]] (δ:4)
- Successor: [[Linear Logic Complexity]] (δ:6)

δ:6 [[Linear Logic Complexity]]
- Predecessor: [[Implicit Complexity Theory]] (δ:5)
- Successor: [[Ordinal Analysis of Provers]] (δ:7)

## Advanced Theory
δ:7 [[Ordinal Analysis of Provers]]
- Predecessor: [[Linear Logic Complexity]] (δ:6)
- Successor: [[Transfinite Recursion Theory]] (δ:8)

δ:8 [[Transfinite Recursion Theory]]
- Predecessor: [[Ordinal Analysis of Provers]] (δ:7)
- Successor: [[Large Cardinal Complexity]] (δ:9)

δ:9 [[Large Cardinal Complexity]]
- Predecessor: [[Transfinite Recursion Theory]] (δ:8)
- Successor: [[Consistency Strength Hierarchies]] (δ:10)

## Theoretical Frontiers
δ:10 [[Consistency Strength Hierarchies]]
- Predecessor: [[Large Cardinal Complexity]] (δ:9)
- Successor: [[Transcendental Set Theory]] (δ:11)

δ:11 [[Transcendental Set Theory]]
- Predecessor: [[Consistency Strength Hierarchies]] (δ:10)
- Successor: [[Ultimate L Theory]] (δ:12)

δ:12 [[Ultimate L Theory]]
- Predecessor: [[Transcendental Set Theory]] (δ:11)
- Successor: (At frontier of current mathematical knowledge)

## Key Transitions:
- δ:1-3: Foundational concepts accessible to general computer science graduates
- δ:4-6: Requires specialized graduate study in theoretical computer science
- δ:7-9: Research level understanding of mathematical logic
- δ:10-12: Current research frontiers in set theory and foundations

These depths represent increasingly specialized knowledge where each level typically requires understanding of multiple branches at previous levels. The progression shows how complexity theory eventually merges with pure mathematics at the highest levels of abstraction.
