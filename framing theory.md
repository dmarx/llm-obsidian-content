## Framing Theory

**Framing Theory** is a [[communication theory]] that explores how media and communicators construct reality by highlighting certain aspects of an issue and shaping how it is perceived. Developed by Erving Goffman and later expanded by scholars like Robert Entman, framing theory posits that the way information is presented (the "frame") influences audience understanding and interpretation. 

### Core Principles

1. **Selection and Salience**: Framing involves selecting certain aspects of a perceived reality and making them more salient in a communication text to promote a particular interpretation, evaluation, or solution.
2. **Context and Interpretation**: Frames provide a context that influences how information is interpreted, guiding the audience to see issues in a specific light.
3. **Framing Effects**: The influence of frames on audience perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors, often by shaping the criteria used to evaluate information and make decisions.

### Key Concepts

1. **Frames**: Schemas of interpretation that guide individuals on how to understand and respond to events. Frames highlight certain aspects of an issue while downplaying others.
2. **Issue Framing**: Presenting an issue in a way that influences how it is perceived and understood. This can affect public opinion, policy preferences, and behaviors.
3. **Media Frames**: The specific ways in which media outlets structure and present news stories, affecting how audiences interpret and respond to the information.

### Types of Frames

1. **Episodic vs. Thematic Frames**: Episodic frames focus on specific events or cases, often leading to attributions of individual responsibility. Thematic frames, on the other hand, provide context and trends, leading to attributions of systemic or societal responsibility.
2. **Gain vs. Loss Frames**: Gain frames emphasize the benefits or positive outcomes of an action, while loss frames highlight the costs or negative outcomes. These frames can influence risk perceptions and decision-making.
3. **Conflict Frames**: Highlight disagreements and confrontations between parties, often used in political and sports coverage to attract attention.
4. **Human Interest Frames**: Focus on personal stories and emotional angles to make issues more relatable and engaging.

### Examples of Framing

1. **Political Communication**: Politicians and media outlets often frame issues like immigration, healthcare, and climate change to influence public opinion and policy debates. For instance, immigration can be framed as a security threat or as a humanitarian issue.
2. **Health Communication**: Public health campaigns use framing to encourage behavior change. For example, smoking cessation messages may use gain frames (emphasizing health benefits) or loss frames (highlighting health risks).
3. **Environmental Issues**: Media coverage of environmental issues can be framed to emphasize economic impacts, scientific uncertainty, or moral responsibility, shaping public perception and policy support.

### Empirical Evidence

#### Media Studies

Research has shown that media frames significantly influence public opinion. For example, studies have demonstrated that news coverage framing welfare as a burden on taxpayers leads to more negative public attitudes towards welfare recipients compared to framing that emphasizes helping those in need.

#### Psychological Studies

Experiments in psychology have shown that framing effects can influence decision-making and risk perceptions. For instance, people are more likely to choose a medical treatment with a 90% survival rate (gain frame) than one with a 10% mortality rate (loss frame), even though the statistics are identical.

### Mathematical Modeling of Framing Effects

Consider a model where the impact \( I \) of a frame on an individual's perception is a function of the frame's salience \( S \) and the individual's preexisting beliefs \( B \):

$$
I = \alpha S \cdot (1 + \beta B)
$$

where:
- \( \alpha \) represents the baseline influence of the frame,
- \( S \) represents the salience of the frame,
- \( \beta \) represents the sensitivity of the individual to the frame based on their preexisting beliefs.

This model suggests that the impact of framing increases with both the salience of the frame and the alignment with preexisting beliefs.

### Implications of Framing Theory

1. **Media Literacy**: Understanding framing helps individuals critically evaluate media content and recognize how frames influence their perceptions and opinions.
2. **Political Campaigns**: Politicians and strategists can use framing to shape public opinion and garner support for policies and candidates.
3. **Public Relations**: Organizations can manage their public image and influence stakeholder perceptions by strategically framing their messages.
4. **Health Communication**: Effective framing can enhance the impact of health messages and interventions, promoting healthier behaviors and attitudes.

### Criticisms and Challenges

1. **Over-Simplification**: Critics argue that framing theory may oversimplify the complex interplay of factors that influence perception and decision-making.
2. **Measurement Issues**: Quantifying the impact of frames and isolating framing effects from other influences can be challenging in empirical research.
3. **Context Dependence**: The effectiveness of frames can vary across different cultural and social contexts, making it difficult to generalize findings.

**ASSISTANT**

**Framing theory** is a concept in communication and media studies that explores how the presentation and context of information influence public perception and interpretation. The theory suggests that the way information is framed or structured can significantly affect how audiences understand and react to that information. This involves selecting certain aspects of a perceived reality and emphasizing them in a way that promotes a particular interpretation or perspective.

## Key Aspects of Framing Theory

### Definition

Framing theory involves:
1. **Selection**: Choosing specific aspects of a story or issue to highlight.
2. **Emphasis**: Focusing on particular elements or angles to shape the narrative.
3. **Exclusion**: Omitting certain details or perspectives that do not fit the chosen frame.
4. **Elaboration**: Providing additional context or details to support the selected frame.

### Importance

- **Shaping Perceptions**: Influences how audiences perceive and understand issues and events.
- **Guiding Public Opinion**: Directs public attention and shapes opinions by emphasizing certain aspects over others.
- **Policy Influence**: Affects policy discussions and decisions by framing issues in specific ways that align with certain agendas.
- **Cultural Impact**: Contributes to the construction of social and cultural norms through repeated framing of issues.

## Mechanisms of Framing

### 1. Problem Definition

#### Identifying Issues

- **Issue Selection**: Defining what the primary issue is and why it is significant.
- **Causal Interpretation**: Explaining the causes of the issue.

#### Example

- **Unemployment**: Framing unemployment as a result of economic policies versus framing it as a consequence of automation and technological change.

### 2. Attribution of Responsibility

#### Assigning Blame or Credit

- **Causal Responsibility**: Determining who or what is responsible for the issue.
- **Solution Responsibility**: Identifying who or what is responsible for addressing the issue.

#### Example

- **Health Crisis**: Framing a health crisis as a failure of government policy versus framing it as a result of individual behaviors.

### 3. Moral Evaluation

#### Judging Actions and Outcomes

- **Moral Judgments**: Making ethical or moral judgments about the actors involved or the outcomes of an issue.
- **Value Frames**: Using values and beliefs to frame the issue.

#### Example

- **Immigration**: Framing immigration as a humanitarian issue versus framing it as a national security threat.

### 4. Treatment Recommendations

#### Suggesting Solutions
