Singularity Theory


**ASSISTANT**

**Singularity theory** is a branch of mathematics that studies spaces that are not well-behaved, such as points where a mathematical object is not defined or not differentiable. This theory has applications across various fields including [[differential topology]], algebraic geometry, and complex analysis. It provides a framework to understand and classify singularities, study their properties, and analyze their behavior under various transformations.

### Key Concepts

1. **Singularities**: Points where a mathematical object fails to be well-behaved. For example, a function may not be differentiable or a manifold may fail to be smooth at these points.
2. **Critical Points and Values**: For a smooth map \( f: M \to N \), a point \( p \in M \) is a critical point if the differential \( df_p \) is not surjective. The image \( f(p) \) is a critical value.
3. **Catastrophe Theory**: Studies how small changes in parameters of a system can cause sudden qualitative changes in its behavior.
4. **Bifurcation Theory**: Analyzes changes in the structure of a given family of solutions to a system of equations as parameters are varied.

### Types of Singularities

1. **Algebraic Singularities**: Points where an algebraic variety fails to be smooth.
2. **Analytic Singularities**: Points where an analytic function fails to be differentiable.
3. **Morse Singularities**: Non-degenerate critical points of a smooth function, where the Hessian matrix is invertible.

### Examples

1. **Cusp**: A point on a curve where the curve has a point of tangency with itself, such as \( y^2 = x^3 \) at the origin.
2. **Node**: A type of singularity where two branches of a curve intersect transversely, such as \( y^2 = x^2(x+1) \) at the origin.
3. **Fold**: A point where the tangent to the curve doubles back on itself, such as \( y = x^3 - 3x \) at the origin.

### Important Theorems and Concepts

1. **Morse Theory**: A branch of singularity theory that studies the topology of manifolds using smooth functions and their critical points.
   - **Morse Lemma**: Near a non-degenerate critical point, a smooth function can be written in a quadratic form.
   - **Morse Index**: The number of negative eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix at a critical point.

2. **Whitney's Theorem**: Classifies stable singularities of smooth maps between manifolds and shows that stable singularities are generic.

3. **Catastrophe Theory**: Studies the phenomena where a small change in the parameters of a system can cause a sudden change in its behavior. René Thom developed seven elementary catastrophes that classify generic singularities: fold, cusp, swallowtail, butterfly, and the elliptic/hyperbolic umbilics.

4. **Milnor Fibration**: Describes how a function behaves near a singularity. It provides a fibration structure to understand the topology of the fibers and the behavior of the function near the critical value.

### Applications

1. **Physics**: Singularities in solutions to physical equations can indicate phase transitions or critical points in materials.
2. **Engineering**: Bifurcation and catastrophe theories are used to analyze stability and failure in mechanical systems.
3. **Biology**: Modeling population dynamics and changes in ecosystems often involves understanding bifurcations and singularities.
4. **Economics**: Catastrophe theory is applied to study economic systems and market behaviors, particularly in predicting sudden changes.

### Example: The Cusp Catastrophe

Consider the cusp catastrophe, which can be described by the potential function:
$$
V(x, a, b) = x^4 + ax^2 + bx,
```
where \(x\) is the state variable, and \(a\) and \(b\) are control parameters. The equilibrium points are found by solving:
$$
\frac{\partial V}{\partial x} = 4x^3 + 2ax + b = 0.
```
The behavior of the system changes dramatically as \(a\) and \(b\) are varied, illustrating how small changes in control parameters can lead to large changes in the state of the system.

### Advanced Topics

1. **Resolution of Singularities**: A process in algebraic geometry and complex analysis to replace a singular space with a nonsingular one that is related to it.
2. **Stratified Spaces**: A space decomposed into manifolds of varying dimensions, used to study singularities by breaking them into simpler pieces.
3. **Symplectic and Contact Singularity Theory**: Extends singularity theory to symplectic and contact manifolds, with applications in physics and classical mechanics.

### Conclusion

Singularity theory provides a deep and rich framework for understanding points where mathematical objects fail to be well-behaved. By classifying and analyzing these singularities, mathematicians and scientists gain insights into the underlying structures and behaviors of complex systems. The field has wide-ranging applications across numerous disciplines, from theoretical physics to economics. For further study, refer to [[Morse Theory]], [[Catastrophe Theory]], and [[Algebraic Geometry]].

Singularity Theory


**ASSISTANT**

Singularity theory is a branch of mathematics that studies spaces of mappings and the singular points of these mappings, focusing on the properties and structures of singularities—places where mappings fail to be differentiable or where differential properties change abruptly. Originating from the study of critical points of differentiable functions and extending to more general settings, singularity theory intersects with algebraic geometry, [[differential [[topology]]]], and complex analysis, offering profound insights into the behavior of functions and spaces under deformation.

### Fundamental Concepts

- **Singular Point**: In the simplest context, a singular point of a function $f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$ is a point where the derivative (Jacobian matrix) of $f$ fails to be surjective, leading to a loss of regularity. For [[algebraic varieties]], singular points are where the tangent space does not have the expected dimension.

- **Morse Singularities**: In the context of Morse theory, a critical point of a smooth function $f: M \to \mathbb{R}$ (where $M$ is a manifold) is considered non-degenerate (or Morse) if the Hessian matrix at that point is non-singular. Morse theory analyzes how the [[topology]] of level sets of $f$ changes as one passes through critical values, providing insights into the [[topology]] of the manifold $M$.

- **Catastrophe Theory**: A branch of singularity theory that studies how the qualitative structure of the solutions to equations depends on the parameters. Catastrophe theory classifies phenomena characterized by sudden shifts in behavior arising from small changes in circumstances, modeling phenomena such as [[bifurcations]] in dynamical systems.

- **Classification of Singularities**: Singularity theory seeks to classify singularities up to certain equivalence relations, such as right-left equivalence for maps between manifolds. The classification often involves identifying invariants and normal forms for singularities.

### Applications and Examples

- **Optics and Physics**: Catastrophe theory and singularity theory have been applied to optics to explain phenomena such as caustics and wavefront dislocations, as well as in other areas of physics, where the structure of singularities explains phase transitions and critical points in systems.

- **Algebraic Geometry**: Singularity theory is integral to the study of [[algebraic varieties]], where singular points on curves, surfaces, and higher-dimensional spaces are analyzed. The resolution of singularities, particularly in characteristic zero, is a significant achievement in this field.

- **Differential Equations**: In the study of differential equations, especially [[partial differential equations]] (PDEs), singularity theory helps understand the formation and propagation of shocks, singular solutions, and other phenomena where solutions fail to be regular.

- **Robotics and Mechanism Design**: Singular configurations in robotics, where the control or movement of a robot arm becomes problematic, are analyzed using concepts from singularity theory, guiding the design of mechanisms to avoid or leverage these configurations.

### Mathematical Formalism

Singularity theory uses a variety of mathematical tools and concepts, including:

- **Jet Spaces**: Generalizing the concept of Taylor expansions, [[jet spaces]] allow for the local study of functions and mappings, providing a framework for analyzing singularities and their unfoldings.

- **Whitney Stratifications**: A technique for decomposing spaces into manifolds (strata) of varying dimensions, where the singular structure of a space is understood in terms of the geometry and arrangement of these strata.

- **Versal Deformations**: Understanding how a singularity can be "unfolded" into a family of less singular or nonsingular objects, exploring the space of possible deformations that preserve certain properties of the singularity.

Singularity theory provides a rich and intricate framework for dissecting the nuances of spaces and mappings, revealing the underlying stability, structure, and transitions of systems across mathematics and physics. Its development continues to uncover deeper layers of understanding concerning the behavior of complex systems under variation, influencing a broad spectrum of scientific and mathematical disciplines.

# Singularity Theory

Singularity theory is a branch of [[mathematics]] that studies the behavior of functions near points where they fail to be well-behaved. It provides a systematic framework for understanding and classifying [[singularities]] – points where mathematical objects exhibit exceptional or degenerate behavior. This field connects deeply with [[differential geometry]], [[topology]], [[catastrophe theory]], and [[algebraic geometry]].

## Mathematical Foundations

### Basic Definitions

A [[singularity]] in a function occurs at points where standard properties break down. For a smooth function $f: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$, a point $x_0 \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is a singularity if:

1. For a [[differentiable function]], the [[Jacobian matrix]] $Df(x_0)$ has non-maximal rank
2. For a [[complex function]], the function is not [[holomorphic]] or [[meromorphic]]
3. For an [[algebraic variety]], the [[tangent space]] is not well-defined

The core objects of study are [[germs]] of functions – equivalence classes of functions that agree on neighborhoods of a point.

### Equivalence Relations

Two function germs $f, g: (\mathbb{R}^n, 0) \rightarrow (\mathbb{R}^m, 0)$ are considered equivalent under various relations:

1. **[[Right equivalence]]**: $f \sim_R g$ if there exists a [[diffeomorphism]] $\phi$ such that $f = g \circ \phi$
2. **[[Left equivalence]]**: $f \sim_L g$ if there exists a diffeomorphism $\psi$ such that $f = \psi \circ g$
3. **[[Contact equivalence]]**: $f \sim_C g$ if there exists a diffeomorphism $\phi$ and a non-vanishing function $\lambda$ such that $f = \lambda \cdot (g \circ \phi)$
4. **[[Right-left equivalence]]**: $f \sim_{RL} g$ if there exist diffeomorphisms $\phi$ and $\psi$ such that $f = \psi \circ g \circ \phi$

These equivalence relations define [[orbits]] in the space of function germs, which form the basis for classifying singularities.

## Classification of Singularities

### Critical Points of Functions

For a smooth function $f: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, a [[critical point]] occurs where $\nabla f(x) = 0$. The critical point is:

1. **[[Non-degenerate]]** if the [[Hessian matrix]] $H(f)(x)$ is non-singular
2. **[[Degenerate]]** if $\det(H(f)(x)) = 0$

By [[Morse theory]], non-degenerate critical points are locally equivalent to:

$$f(x) \sim \pm x_1^2 \pm x_2^2 \pm \cdots \pm x_n^2$$

The number of negative signs is the [[Morse index]].

### ADE Classification

The [[ADE classification]] provides a taxonomy for simple singularities of functions:

1. **A-series** (Type $A_k$): $f(x) = x^{k+1}$ (for $k \geq 1$)
2. **D-series** (Type $D_k$): $f(x,y) = x^2y + y^{k-1}$ (for $k \geq 4$)
3. **E-series** (Types $E_6, E_7, E_8$): Exceptional cases with higher complexity

This classification connects to the [[Cartan-Killing classification]] of simple Lie algebras and many other mathematical structures.

### Thom-Boardman Singularities

For mappings $f: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^p$, the [[Thom-Boardman classification]] describes singularities using sequences of integers $\Sigma^{i_1,i_2,...,i_k}$ representing the ranks of successive derivatives.

### Caustics and Wavefronts

[[Caustics]] are singularities of families of rays or wavefronts, classified by their [[codimension]]:

1. **[[Fold]]** (Codimension 1): Locally equivalent to $(x, y) \mapsto (x, y^2)$
2. **[[Cusp]]** (Codimension 2): Locally equivalent to $(x, y) \mapsto (x, xy + y^3)$
3. **[[Swallowtail]]** (Codimension 3): More complex configuration
4. **[[Butterfly]]** (Codimension 4): Higher-order singularity

## Unfolding and Stability

### Versal Unfoldings

A [[versal unfolding]] of a function germ $f$ is a family of functions $F(x, u)$ such that any other deformation of $f$ can be induced from $F$ by a reparameterization. The [[miniversal unfolding]] has the minimal possible number of parameters, and this number is the [[modality]] or [[Milnor number]] of the singularity.

The formula for computing the versal unfolding is:

$$F(x, u) = f(x) + \sum_{i=1}^r u_i \phi_i(x)$$

Where $\{\phi_1, \ldots, \phi_r\}$ forms a basis for the [[local algebra]] $\mathcal{O}_n/\mathcal{J}_f$.

### Structural Stability

A function $f$ is [[structurally stable]] if small perturbations yield functions that are topologically equivalent to $f$. Key theoretical results include:

1. **[[Mather's theorem]]**: Characterizes stable function germs
2. **[[Thom's isotopy lemma]]**: Ensures topological equivalence under certain conditions
3. **[[Whitney's condition]]**: Criteria for stability of mappings between manifolds

## Catastrophe Theory

### Elementary Catastrophes

[[Catastrophe theory]], developed by René Thom, studies how small changes in parameters can lead to dramatic changes in the behavior of a system. The [[elementary catastrophes]] include:

1. **[[Fold catastrophe]]**: $V(x) = x^3 + ax$ (Codimension 1)
2. **[[Cusp catastrophe]]**: $V(x) = x^4 + ax^2 + bx$ (Codimension 2)
3. **[[Swallowtail catastrophe]]**: $V(x) = x^5 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx$ (Codimension 3)
4. **[[Butterfly catastrophe]]**: $V(x) = x^6 + ax^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx$ (Codimension 4)
5. **[[Hyperbolic umbilic]]**: $V(x,y) = x^3 + y^3 + axy + bx + cy$ (Codimension 3)
6. **[[Elliptic umbilic]]**: $V(x,y) = x^3 - 3xy^2 + a(x^2+y^2) + bx + cy$ (Codimension 3)
7. **[[Parabolic umbilic]]**: $V(x,y) = x^2y + y^4 + ax^2 + by^2 + cx + dy$ (Codimension 4)

These potentials govern the behavior of systems near critical points and predict qualitative changes.

### Applications in Sciences

Catastrophe theory provides models for:

1. **[[Structural mechanics]]**: Buckling phenomena and elastic instabilities
2. **[[Optical caustics]]**: Light patterns created by refraction or reflection
3. **[[Phase transitions]]**: Abrupt changes in physical states of matter
4. **[[Biological morphogenesis]]**: Formation of patterns during development
5. **[[Behavioral sciences]]**: Modeling sudden shifts in behavior

## Algebraic Aspects

### Local Algebra and Milnor Number

For a function germ $f: (\mathbb{C}^n, 0) \rightarrow (\mathbb{C}, 0)$ with an isolated singularity at the origin, the [[Milnor number]] is:

$$\mu = \dim_{\mathbb{C}} \mathcal{O}_n/\mathcal{J}_f$$

Where $\mathcal{O}_n$ is the ring of function germs and $\mathcal{J}_f$ is the [[Jacobian ideal]] generated by the partial derivatives of $f$.

The Milnor number determines:
1. The rank of the middle homology of the [[Milnor fiber]]
2. The degree of the [[topological Gauss map]]
3. The number of parameters in a versal unfolding

### Tjurina Number and Deformations

The [[Tjurina number]] is:

$$\tau = \dim_{\mathbb{C}} \mathcal{O}_n/(f, \mathcal{J}_f)$$

It measures the dimension of the [[base space]] of the [[versal deformation]].

### Intersection Homology and Perverse Sheaves

For singular algebraic varieties, [[intersection homology]] provides a generalization of homology that satisfies [[Poincaré duality]]. [[Perverse sheaves]] form a category of constructible complexes with remarkable properties for singular spaces.

## Geometric Singularities

### Singularities of Curves and Surfaces

For algebraic curves, singularities are classified by their:

1. **[[Multiplicity]]**: The order of the lowest-degree term in the local expansion
2. **[[Delta invariant]]**: A measure of the curve's degeneracy
3. **[[Branch number]]**: The number of local branches through the singularity

Common types include:
- **[[Node]]**: Intersection of two smooth branches
- **[[Cusp]]**: Where a curve forms a sharp point
- **[[Tacnode]]**: Where a curve touches itself

For surfaces, classifications include:
- **[[Du Val singularities]]** (or [[ADE surface singularities]])
- **[[Elliptic singularities]]**
- **[[Simple surface singularities]]**

### Resolution of Singularities

[[Resolution of singularities]] is the process of removing singularities by:

1. [[Blowing up]]: Replacing a point with all directions through it
2. [[Normalization]]: Removing non-normal singularities
3. [[Minimal resolution]]: Finding the simplest desingularization

The fundamental result is [[Hironaka's theorem]] (1964), which guarantees the existence of resolutions for algebraic varieties over fields of characteristic zero.

## Applications and Extensions
