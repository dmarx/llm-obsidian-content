### Onsager Reciprocal Relations

The **Onsager reciprocal relations** are a set of equations that describe the symmetry properties of coupled irreversible processes near thermodynamic equilibrium. These relations, first formulated by [[Lars Onsager]] in 1931, provide a deep connection between the fluxes and forces in irreversible thermodynamics, showing that certain cross-coefficients in the linear response functions are equal. The Onsager reciprocal relations have been fundamental in developing nonequilibrium thermodynamics and have applications in various fields, including physics, chemistry, and biology.

#### Background and Context

In nonequilibrium thermodynamics, we are often interested in how systems respond to small deviations from equilibrium. Consider a system near equilibrium where several irreversible processes are occurring simultaneously, such as heat conduction, diffusion, and chemical reactions. Each of these processes can be characterized by a **thermodynamic flux** (like a heat flux or particle flux) and a corresponding **thermodynamic force** (like a temperature gradient or chemical potential gradient).

The fluxes $\{J_i\}$ can be generally related to the forces $\{X_j\}$ through linear phenomenological relations, which are valid when the deviations from equilibrium are small:

$$
J_i = \sum_j L_{ij} X_j,
$$

where:
- $J_i$ is the flux associated with the $i$-th process,
- $X_j$ is the thermodynamic force driving the $j$-th process,
- $L_{ij}$ are the **phenomenological coefficients** that quantify the linear response of flux $J_i$ to force $X_j$.

#### Formulation of the Onsager Reciprocal Relations

The Onsager reciprocal relations state that, under certain conditions, the phenomenological coefficients are symmetric:

$$
L_{ij} = L_{ji}.
$$

This symmetry implies that the response of the flux $J_i$ to a force $X_j$ is the same as the response of the flux $J_j$ to the force $X_i$. 

The conditions under which the Onsager reciprocal relations hold are:
1. **Near-equilibrium**: The system must be close to thermodynamic equilibrium, where the linear approximation is valid.
2. **Microscopic Reversibility**: The underlying microscopic dynamics must obey time-reversal symmetry, which means that the fundamental physical laws governing the microscopic particles are invariant under time reversal. This typically implies no external magnetic fields or angular momentum biases that could break time-reversal symmetry.

#### Physical Interpretation and Implications

The Onsager reciprocal relations have a profound physical interpretation in terms of **microscopic reversibility** and **symmetry properties** of the system. These relations suggest that there is an inherent symmetry in how systems respond to perturbations near equilibrium. If a perturbation (or force) causes a certain flux, then the same perturbation in reverse (or another related force) will cause a related flux in a symmetric manner.

For example, consider a system where both heat and particle diffusion processes are present:

- **Thermal diffusion (Soret effect)**: A temperature gradient causes particles to diffuse from hot to cold regions.
- **Dufour effect**: A concentration gradient of particles causes heat flux.

The Onsager reciprocal relations state that the coefficient describing the Soret effect (how much particle flux results from a temperature gradient) is equal to the coefficient describing the Dufour effect (how much heat flux results from a concentration gradient):

$$
L_{12} = L_{21}.
$$

This symmetry can be generalized to more complex systems with multiple interacting processes.

#### Derivation of Onsager Reciprocal Relations

The Onsager relations can be derived from fundamental principles, such as the assumption of microscopic reversibility and the use of the **principle of detailed balance** in statistical mechanics.

1. **Microscopic Reversibility**: Consider a microscopic state $\alpha$ evolving to another state $\beta$ under time-reversible dynamics. If the system is perturbed from equilibrium by an external force, the probability of transition from $\alpha$ to $\beta$ ($P_{\alpha \to \beta}$) and from $\beta$ to $\alpha$ ($P_{\beta \to \alpha}$) are related through time-reversal symmetry.

2. **Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem**: Near equilibrium, the [[fluctuation-dissipation theorem]] relates the response of a system to small perturbations (dissipation) to the intrinsic fluctuations of the system at equilibrium. Onsager used this relationship to connect the phenomenological coefficients $L_{ij}$ with the correlation functions of fluxes in equilibrium.

The derivation involves considering the linearized forms of the entropy production and using the properties of time-reversal symmetry to show that the cross-coefficients must be equal.

#### Applications of Onsager Reciprocal Relations

1. **Thermoelectric Phenomena**: In thermoelectric materials, where both electrical and thermal transport are significant, the Onsager reciprocal relations relate the Seebeck effect (generation of an electric voltage due to a temperature difference) and the Peltier effect (absorption or emission of heat due to an electric current).

2. **Transport Processes in Electrochemistry**: In electrochemical systems, the transport of ions under the influence of electric fields and concentration gradients can be analyzed using Onsager relations, linking conductivity, diffusivity, and transference numbers.

3. **Biological Systems**: In biological membranes, Onsager relations help understand the coupled transport of ions and molecules, such as the coupling between sodium and glucose transport across cell membranes.

4. **Chemical Kinetics and Diffusion**: Onsager relations are used to analyze multicomponent diffusion processes, chemical reactions, and other coupled phenomena in complex fluids and mixtures.

#### Generalized Onsager Relations

For systems under the influence of magnetic fields or with broken time-reversal symmetry, generalized Onsager reciprocal relations can be formulated:

$$
L_{ij}(\mathbf{B}) = L_{ji}(-\mathbf{B}),
$$

where $\mathbf{B}$ represents an external magnetic field. This modification accounts for the fact that the presence of a magnetic field breaks time-reversal symmetry, so the Onsager coefficients may not be equal but rather related by reversing the magnetic field's direction.

### Conclusion

The **Onsager reciprocal relations** provide a powerful and elegant framework for understanding the symmetry properties of coupled irreversible processes near equilibrium. By establishing that certain response coefficients are equal, these relations simplify the analysis of complex systems and have wide-ranging applications across physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering. The principles underlying the Onsager relations continue to influence contemporary research in nonequilibrium thermodynamics and statistical mechanics.

Onsager reciprocal relations


**ASSISTANT**

The [[Onsager Reciprocal Relations|Onsager reciprocal relations]] are a set of equations that describe the reciprocal relationship between fluxes and forces in thermodynamic systems far from equilibrium. Formulated by Lars Onsager in 1931, these relations play a crucial role in nonequilibrium thermodynamics, providing a fundamental framework for predicting the behavior of systems out of equilibrium. They are particularly important in understanding transport phenomena, such as heat conduction, diffusion, and electrical conduction.

### Mathematical Formulation

Consider a system out of equilibrium in which multiple processes are occurring simultaneously. Each process can be characterized by a thermodynamic force, $X_i$, driving a corresponding flux, $J_i$, where $i$ represents the ith process. The forces can be gradients of temperature, chemical potential, or other thermodynamic potentials, and the fluxes can be heat flow, particle flow, or electric current.

Onsager postulated that the fluxes in a system close to equilibrium are linearly related to the thermodynamic forces acting on the system. This relationship can be expressed as:

$$ J_i = \sum_j L_{ij} X_j $$

where $L_{ij}$ are the Onsager coefficients, which are phenomenological constants characterizing the system. These coefficients are dependent on the properties of the material and the temperature, but are independent of the forces and fluxes.

The Onsager reciprocal relations state that for a system close to equilibrium, the matrix of Onsager coefficients is symmetric, meaning:

$$ L_{ij} = L_{ji} $$

### Physical Interpretation

The physical interpretation of the Onsager reciprocal relations is that if a gradient (force) in one quantity (e.g., temperature gradient) causes a flow (flux) of another quantity (e.g., electrical current), then a gradient in the second quantity will induce a flow of the first quantity. This symmetry in cross-effects is a manifestation of the microscopic reversibility of physical laws at equilibrium, embodying the time reversal symmetry of the underlying microscopic dynamics.

### Applications

The Onsager reciprocal relations find applications in various fields, including:

- **Thermoelectric Effects**: The relations describe the interconnection between thermal and electrical effects, such as the Seebeck and Peltier effects, which are critical for the design of thermoelectric materials and devices.
- **Electrochemical Systems**: They are used to understand the coupling between ionic transport and electrical conduction in electrolytes.
- **Diffusion Processes**: The relations help in analyzing coupled diffusion processes, where the diffusion of one species influences the diffusion of another.

### Limitations and Extensions

While the Onsager reciprocal relations are derived under the assumption that the system is near equilibrium (linear response regime), various extensions have been developed to address nonlinear regimes and systems far from equilibrium. These include the Onsager-Machlup theory and the extension of linear response theory to nonlinear regimes.

### Conclusion

The [[Onsager Reciprocal Relations|Onsager reciprocal relations]] provide a fundamental theoretical framework for understanding and predicting the behavior of nonequilibrium thermodynamic systems. They highlight the interconnectedness of different physical phenomena and have profound implications for the design and analysis of materials and processes across a wide range of disciplines.
