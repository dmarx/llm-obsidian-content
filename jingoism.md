### Jingoism

Jingoism is a form of extreme patriotism that manifests as an aggressive foreign policy, where national interests are promoted in a belligerent and often militaristic manner. This term is closely related to [[nationalism]] but is distinguished by its overt hostility towards other nations.

#### Etymology and Historical Context

The term "jingoism" originated in the late 19th century during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78. It was popularized by a British music hall song with the refrain:

> "We don't want to fight, but by Jingo if we do,  
> We've got the ships, we've got the men, and got the money too!"

The term encapsulated the aggressive foreign policy stance prevalent in the British Empire at that time.

#### Characteristics

1. **Militarism**: Advocacy for the use of military force to resolve international disputes.
2. **National Chauvinism**: The belief in the superiority of one's own nation over others.
3. **Imperialism**: Support for expanding a nation's influence and territory.

#### Comparison with Related Concepts

- **Nationalism**: While [[nationalism]] involves strong identification with one's own nation and support for its interests, it does not necessarily imply the aggressive foreign policy stance inherent in jingoism.
- **Patriotism**: Patriotism refers to a sense of pride in one's country. Unlike jingoism, it does not inherently involve antagonism towards other nations.

#### Examples in History

- **British Empire**: The term "jingoism" itself emerged in the context of the British Empire's aggressive stance during the late 19th century.
- **United States**: The Spanish-American War (1898) saw a surge of jingoistic sentiment in the United States, fueled by the press and public opinion.

#### Analysis

From a theoretical perspective, jingoism can be understood as a hyper-nationalist response to perceived threats or challenges to national prestige and power. It often arises in periods of national crisis or when a nation is seeking to assert its dominance on the global stage.

### Mathematical Formalization

While jingoism is primarily a socio-political phenomenon, we can analyze its dynamics using models from game theory and statistical mechanics.

#### Game Theory

In game theory, jingoistic behavior can be modeled as a strategy in a repeated game, where nations are players. The payoff matrix could represent the costs and benefits of different strategies, such as cooperation, defection, and aggression.

Consider a simplified version of the [[Prisoner's Dilemma]] with strategies: Cooperate (C) and Defect (D), where Defect represents a jingoistic policy.

$$
\begin{array}{c|c|c}
 & \text{C} & \text{D} \\
\hline
\text{C} & (R, R) & (S, T) \\
\text{D} & (T, S) & (P, P) \\
\end{array}
$$

Where:
- $R$ is the reward for mutual cooperation,
- $P$ is the punishment for mutual defection,
- $T$ is the temptation to defect,
- $S$ is the sucker's payoff.

In a jingoistic scenario, $T$ (temptation to defect) is perceived as higher due to the immediate gains from aggressive policies.

#### Statistical Mechanics

From the perspective of statistical mechanics, jingoistic behavior can be analyzed as a phase transition in a social system. Consider a population of agents with an opinion $\sigma_i \in \{-1, 1\}$, where $-1$ represents peaceful stance and $1$ represents jingoistic stance. 

The Hamiltonian for this system could be written as:

$$
H = -J \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} \sigma_i \sigma_j - h \sum_i \sigma_i
$$

Where:
- $J$ represents the interaction strength between neighboring agents,
- $h$ represents an external field promoting jingoistic sentiment.

As the external field $h$ increases, the system may undergo a phase transition from a mixed state to a predominantly jingoistic state, analogous to magnetization in ferromagnetic materials.

In summary, jingoism represents an extreme and aggressive form of [[nationalism]], characterized by a belligerent foreign policy. Its dynamics can be explored using various theoretical frameworks, including game theory and statistical mechanics, to understand the conditions under which such behavior emerges and stabilizes within a population.
