**ASSISTANT**

Yes, the tactic employed by Dave & Buster's, where customers are required to use a proprietary currency, is known in business terms as a **"closed-loop system"** or **"closed-loop payment system."** This strategy has several specific advantages and implications:

### Closed-Loop System

#### Definition
A closed-loop system is a payment system where the currency or credits used can only be spent within a specific environment or ecosystem. In the case of Dave & Buster's, the Power Cards act as the closed-loop currency, usable only within their venues.

### Strategic Advantages of Closed-Loop Systems

1. **Upfront Revenue and Cash Flow**
   - Customers purchase credits in advance, providing the business with immediate cash flow.
   - Non-refundable nature of the credits ensures that the money remains within the company once spent.

2. **Enhanced Customer Retention**
   - Unused credits encourage customers to return to the venue to utilize their remaining balance.
   - Promotions and bonuses tied to the proprietary currency incentivize repeat visits.

3. **Increased Spending**
   - The psychological distance from actual money can lead to higher spending.
   - Bundled deals and bonus credit offers encourage customers to purchase more credits than they might with cash.

4. **Operational Efficiency**
   - Reduces the need for handling cash, streamlining transactions.
   - Simplifies the payment process at gaming machines and other points of sale.
   - Facilitates data collection on customer behavior and preferences, enabling targeted marketing and operational improvements.

5. **Security and Fraud Reduction**
   - Digital transactions reduce risks associated with cash handling, such as theft and fraud.
   - Proprietary currency can only be used within the specific ecosystem, preventing misuse elsewhere.

6. **Pricing Flexibility**
   - Allows dynamic pricing adjustments for games and services without changing real-world currency values.
   - Facilitates promotional pricing strategies, such as offering more credits during off-peak times to drive traffic.

### Examples of Closed-Loop Systems
- **Theme Parks**: Many theme parks use similar systems with prepaid cards or wristbands.
- **Cruise Ships**: Passengers often use a ship-specific card for all onboard purchases.
- **Digital Platforms**: Online gaming platforms and app stores often use proprietary currencies for in-app purchases.

### Conclusion
The closed-loop payment system is a strategic business tactic that provides multiple benefits, including improved cash flow, enhanced customer retention, increased spending, operational efficiency, and security. By requiring customers to use a proprietary currency like Dave & Buster's Power Cards, businesses can create a controlled, engaging, and profitable environment that encourages repeat visits and maximizes revenue.

**ASSISTANT**

The concept of "psychological distance from actual money" refers to the cognitive and emotional disconnect that occurs when people use an intermediary form of currency, such as a proprietary card or digital credits, instead of cash. This phenomenon can lead to higher spending due to several psychological principles and behavioral tendencies. Here’s a detailed explanation:

### Psychological Mechanisms

#### 1. **Reduced Pain of Paying**
When people use cash, they experience a tangible and immediate loss, which can evoke a sensation often referred to as the "pain of paying." This pain is lessened when using a non-cash form of payment.

- **Credit Cards vs. Cash**: Studies have shown that people tend to spend more when using credit cards compared to cash. This is because the physical act of handing over cash creates a stronger sense of loss than swiping a card.
- **Digital Credits**: Similarly, using digital credits or a proprietary currency like Dave & Buster’s Power Cards further reduces this pain, as the connection between the money and the transaction is even more abstract.

#### 2. **Decoupling of Purchase Decisions**
Proprietary currencies create a separation between the purchase of the currency and its use, which can lead to higher spending.

- **Two-Step Transaction**: When customers buy credits upfront and then use them later, the initial act of purchasing the credits becomes disconnected from the act of spending them. This decoupling reduces the immediate impact of spending on decision-making.
- **Prepaid Systems**: Prepaid systems can lead to a “sunk cost” mentality, where customers feel compelled to use up their remaining credits, leading to additional spending they might not have considered if paying directly with cash.

#### 3. **Abstract Currency Value**
Proprietary currencies often have denominations and values that are less intuitive than cash, making it harder for customers to mentally calculate the cost of each transaction.

- **Complex Pricing**: When prices are expressed in credits instead of dollars, it becomes more difficult for customers to keep track of their spending. For example, a game that costs 5 credits might not immediately translate to its dollar equivalent, leading to less cautious spending.
- **Value Perception**: Customers might perceive credits as less valuable than their equivalent in cash, leading to more liberal spending. For example, if a customer purchases 100 credits for $20, each credit feels less significant than a dollar, potentially leading to higher expenditure.

### Behavioral Tendencies

#### 1. **Mental Accounting**
People tend to categorize and treat money differently based on its form and intended use, a concept known as mental accounting.

- **Entertainment Budget**: When customers purchase credits, they may mentally allocate those credits to a specific “entertainment budget,” separate from their regular budget, leading them to spend more freely within that category.
- **Credits as Play Money**: Proprietary credits can feel like “play money,” reducing the psychological barriers to spending and making customers more likely to indulge in additional games and activities.

#### 2. **Commitment and Escalation**
Once customers have invested in buying credits, they are more likely to continue spending to justify their initial investment.

- **Sunk Cost Fallacy**: Customers may feel that they need to “get their money’s worth” out of the credits they’ve purchased, leading to further spending beyond their initial intention.
- **Escalation of Commitment**: This phenomenon occurs when individuals continue a behavior or endeavor as a result of previously invested resources (time, money, effort), which can lead to increased spending in order to maximize perceived value from the initial purchase.

### Empirical Evidence
Several studies support the idea that non-cash payment methods lead to higher spending:

- **Prelec and Simester (2001)**: Found that people are willing to pay more for items when using credit cards compared to cash.
- **Raghubir and Srivastava (2008)**: Demonstrated that the pain of paying is significantly reduced when using less transparent forms of money (e.g., gift cards, digital credits), leading to increased spending.
- **Soman (2003)**: Showed that the decoupling of payment and consumption reduces the psychological impact of spending, resulting in higher overall expenditure.

### Conclusion
The psychological distance from actual money created by using a proprietary currency like Dave & Buster’s Power Cards leads to higher spending through mechanisms such as reduced pain of paying, decoupling of purchase decisions, abstract currency value, mental accounting, and commitment escalation. By leveraging these psychological principles, businesses can effectively increase customer expenditure and enhance overall revenue.
