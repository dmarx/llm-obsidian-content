Goldstone mode


**ASSISTANT**

Goldstone modes arise in the context of spontaneous symmetry breaking in physics, particularly in quantum field theory, condensed matter physics, and statistical mechanics. They correspond to the massless modes or gapless excitations that emerge as a consequence of breaking a continuous symmetry. This phenomenon is formalized in the **Goldstone theorem**, named after Jeffrey Goldstone. Letâ€™s break this down in detail:

## 1. **Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking (SSB)**:
A system exhibits **spontaneous symmetry breaking** when:
- The underlying equations (governing dynamics or interactions) of the system are symmetric under some continuous symmetry group $G$.
- The ground state (or vacuum state) of the system does not respect the same symmetry. Instead, the ground state is invariant only under a subgroup $H \subseteq G$ (the unbroken symmetry).

Mathematically:
- The system is invariant under the symmetry transformation $g \in G$.
- The ground state, $\lvert 0 \rangle$, satisfies $U(g) \lvert 0 \rangle = \lvert 0 \rangle$ only for $g \in H \subseteq G$, where $U(g)$ is the symmetry operator.

### Example:
In a ferromagnet, the Hamiltonian is rotationally symmetric (continuous rotational symmetry group $SO(3)$), but below the critical temperature, the spins align in a specific direction, breaking $SO(3)$ to $SO(2)$ (rotations around the chosen axis).

## 2. **Goldstone Theorem**:
Goldstone's theorem states:

> For every spontaneously broken generator of a continuous symmetry, there exists a massless mode (the Goldstone mode or Goldstone boson) associated with fluctuations along the broken symmetry direction.

Let $G$ have $n$ generators, and let $H$ (the unbroken subgroup) have $m$ generators. The number of broken generators is $n - m$, which determines the number of Goldstone modes.

### Mathematical Formalization:
Consider a field $\phi(x)$ that transforms under a symmetry group $G$. If the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the field, $\langle \phi \rangle$, is nonzero and not invariant under $G$, symmetry breaking occurs.

If $T^a$ are the generators of $G$ and $\phi$ transforms as:
$$
\delta \phi(x) = i \epsilon^a T^a \phi(x),
$$
then a broken generator $T^a$ satisfies:
$$
\langle 0 | [T^a, \phi] | 0 \rangle \neq 0.
$$
This non-commutativity signals the emergence of massless modes associated with the broken symmetry.

### Physical Interpretation:
The Goldstone modes correspond to fluctuations of the field $\phi$ in the directions of the broken generators. These modes are gapless because their dispersion relation $\omega(\mathbf{k})$ satisfies $\omega(0) = 0$ (zero energy at zero momentum).

## 3. **Goldstone Mode Dynamics**:
### Dispersion Relation:
Goldstone modes typically exhibit a linear or quadratic dispersion relation:
- **Relativistic systems**: $\omega(\mathbf{k}) \propto |\mathbf{k}|$ (linear dispersion, e.g., pions in particle physics).
- **Non-relativistic systems**: $\omega(\mathbf{k}) \propto \mathbf{k}^2$ (quadratic dispersion, e.g., magnons in condensed matter systems).

### Nonlinear Sigma Model:
The dynamics of Goldstone modes can often be described by an effective low-energy theory called a **nonlinear sigma model**, which focuses on the fluctuations around the vacuum manifold $G/H$:
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{eff}} = \frac{1}{2} g_{ij}(\phi) \partial_\mu \phi^i \partial^\mu \phi^j,
$$
where $g_{ij}(\phi)$ is the metric on the vacuum manifold.

## 4. **Examples**:

1. **Pions in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)**:
   - In QCD, the approximate chiral symmetry $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$ is spontaneously broken to $SU(2)_V$ by the quark condensate.
   - The three broken generators correspond to the three Goldstone bosons, which are the pions ($\pi^+, \pi^0, \pi^-$).
   - Their masslessness is slightly lifted due to explicit breaking of chiral symmetry by quark masses.

2. **Magnons in Ferromagnets**:
   - In a ferromagnet, the rotational symmetry $SO(3)$ is broken to $SO(2)$ below the Curie temperature.
   - The two broken generators result in one Goldstone mode, corresponding to spin-wave excitations (magnons).

3. **Higgs Mechanism**:
   - The Higgs mechanism provides a notable exception to the Goldstone theorem in gauge theories: Goldstone bosons associated with broken gauge symmetries become longitudinal modes of massive gauge bosons.

## 5. **Mathematical Details of Goldstone Bosons in Field Theory**:

Consider a scalar field theory with a potential $V(\phi)$ invariant under a continuous symmetry group $G$. If $\phi$ acquires a vacuum expectation value:
$$
\langle \phi \rangle = \phi_0 \neq 0,
$$
the potential can be expanded around $\phi_0$, revealing both massive modes (radial oscillations) and massless modes (angular oscillations along the symmetry-breaking direction).

Let $\phi = \phi_0 + \delta \phi$, and decompose $\delta \phi$ into components along the vacuum manifold. The components tangent to the vacuum manifold correspond to Goldstone modes.

If you're interested, I can go deeper into the Lagrangian formalism, specific examples, or the interplay with gauge fields (e.g., Higgs mechanism).
