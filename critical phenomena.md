Critical Phenomena


**ASSISTANT**

Critical phenomena refer to the behaviors and properties of physical systems undergoing continuous phase transitions. These phenomena are characterized by diverging correlation lengths and fluctuations that occur at the critical point, where the system transitions from one phase to another, such as from a liquid to a gas or from a ferromagnet to a paramagnet. Understanding critical phenomena involves the study of universal properties and scaling behaviors near the critical point.

## Overview

### Phase Transitions

Phase transitions can be classified into first-order and continuous (second-order) transitions:

1. **First-Order Transitions**: Characterized by a discontinuous change in the order parameter (e.g., density, magnetization) and the coexistence of phases. Examples include melting and boiling.
2. **Continuous Transitions**: Characterized by a continuous change in the order parameter and the divergence of the correlation length and susceptibilities. Examples include the ferromagnetic transition in iron and the superfluid transition in helium-4.

### Order Parameter and Symmetry

The order parameter is a quantity that describes the degree of order across the phase transition. It typically changes from zero in one phase to non-zero in the other phase. For example, in the Ising model, the magnetization serves as the order parameter.

### Critical Point

At the critical point:
- The correlation length \(\xi\) diverges, meaning that fluctuations occur over all length scales.
- The system exhibits scale invariance, leading to power-law behaviors in physical quantities.
- Thermodynamic quantities such as specific heat, susceptibility, and compressibility diverge.

## Key Concepts

### Universality

Universality is the principle that systems with different microscopic details but the same symmetries and dimensionality exhibit the same critical behavior. Universal properties are described by critical exponents, which characterize how physical quantities diverge near the critical point.

### Critical Exponents

Critical exponents describe the behavior of physical quantities near the critical point. Common critical exponents include:
- \(\alpha\): Describes the divergence of the specific heat \(C \sim |t|^{-\alpha}\).
- \(\beta\): Describes the behavior of the order parameter \(M \sim |t|^{\beta}\).
- \(\gamma\): Describes the divergence of the susceptibility \(\chi \sim |t|^{-\gamma}\).
- \(\delta\): Relates the order parameter to the external field at \(T_c\), \(M \sim H^{1/\delta}\).
- \(\nu\): Describes the divergence of the correlation length \(\xi \sim |t|^{-\nu}\).
- \(\eta\): Describes the anomalous dimension of the correlation function \(G(r) \sim \frac{1}{r^{d-2+\eta}}\).

Here, \(t = (T - T_c)/T_c\) is the reduced temperature.

### Scaling Laws

Scaling laws relate the critical exponents to each other. These include:
- **Rushbrooke's Scaling Law**: \(\alpha + 2\beta + \gamma = 2\)
- **Widom's Scaling Law**: \(\gamma = \beta (\delta - 1)\)
- **Fisher's Scaling Law**: \(\gamma = \nu (2 - \eta)\)

### Renormalization Group (RG)

The Renormalization Group (RG) approach provides a framework for understanding critical phenomena and calculating critical exponents. RG transformations systematically "zoom out" on the system, integrating out short-range fluctuations and rescaling the system. This process reveals fixed points that characterize the critical behavior.

## Models of Critical Phenomena

### Ising Model

The Ising model is one of the most studied models for understanding critical phenomena. It consists of spins on a lattice that can take values \(\pm 1\), with interactions between nearest neighbors.

The Hamiltonian for the Ising model is:

$$
H = -J \sum_{\langle i, j \rangle} s_i s_j - h \sum_i s_i
$$

where \(J\) is the coupling constant and \(h\) is the external magnetic field.

### XY Model

The XY model describes spins that can rotate freely in a plane. It is used to study superfluidity and the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition.

The Hamiltonian is:

$$
H = -J \sum_{\langle i, j \rangle} \cos(\theta_i - \theta_j)
$$

where \(\theta_i\) is the angle of the spin at site \(i\).

### Heisenberg Model

The Heisenberg model generalizes the Ising and XY models to three-dimensional spins. The spins interact through a dot product, allowing them to point in any direction.

The Hamiltonian is:

$$
H = -J \sum_{\langle i, j \rangle} \mathbf{s}_i \cdot \mathbf{s}_j
$$

### \(\phi^4\) Theory

The \(\phi^4\) theory is a continuum field theory used to study critical phenomena. It is particularly useful for describing phase transitions in scalar field theories.

The Lagrangian density is:

$$
\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2} (\partial_\mu \phi)^2 + \frac{1}{2} r \phi^2 + \frac{u}{4!} \phi^4
$$

where \(r\) and \(u\) are parameters that control the phase transition.

## Applications

### Critical Phenomena in Condensed Matter Physics

- **Magnetism**: Understanding the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic transitions.
- **Superfluidity and Superconductivity**: Describing phase transitions in helium-4 and high-temperature superconductors.
- **Liquid-Gas Transitions**: Studying the critical point of water and other fluids.

### High Energy Physics

- **Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)**: Studying the phase transition between quark-gluon plasma and hadronic matter.
- **Higgs Mechanism**: Understanding the electroweak phase transition.

### Cosmology

- **Early Universe**: Describing phase transitions in the early universe, such as the inflationary phase transition.
- **Cosmic Strings and Domain Walls**: Studying topological defects formed during phase transitions in the early universe.

critical phenomena


**ASSISTANT**

Critical phenomena refer to the peculiar behavior of physical systems near continuous phase transitions, also known as second-order phase transitions. At these critical points, a system undergoes dramatic changes in its physical properties, and these changes are characterized by universal features that are largely independent of the system's microscopic details. The study of critical phenomena encompasses a broad range of systems across physics, chemistry, and materials science, including the transition between liquid and gas phases, magnetization in ferromagnetic materials, and superconductivity.

### Key Features of Critical Phenomena

1. **Critical Point:** This is the point at which the phase transition occurs. For example, at the critical point of a liquid-gas transition, the distinction between the liquid and gas phases disappears.

2. **Order Parameter:** An order parameter is a quantity that measures the degree of order across the transition. For a magnet, the order parameter could be the net magnetization, which goes to zero as the system approaches the critical temperature from below.

3. **Divergence of Correlation Length:** Near the critical point, fluctuations occur over all length scales, and the correlation length $\xi$, which measures the size over which particles or spins are correlated, diverges. Mathematically, $\xi \sim |T-T_c|^{-\nu}$, where $T$ is the temperature, $T_c$ is the critical temperature, and $\nu$ is a critical exponent.

4. **Critical Exponents and Scaling Laws:** Critical exponents describe how physical quantities behave near the critical point. They are universal in the sense that they depend only on the dimensionality of the system and the symmetry of the order parameter, not on the microscopic details of the system. Critical exponents define scaling laws that describe how quantities like the order parameter, susceptibility, and specific heat change as the system approaches the critical point.

### Mathematical Formalism

The behavior of systems near critical points can be described by the renormalization group (RG) theory, which provides a framework for understanding the changes in physical systems as one zooms in or out on different length scales. RG theory explains the universality of critical phenomena and the values of critical exponents through the concept of fixed points and flow in the space of Hamiltonians or [[free energy]] [[functionals]].

The Landau theory of phase transitions provides another approach to describing critical phenomena. It involves expanding the [[free energy]] as a power series in the order parameter and its gradients. While Landau theory correctly predicts the existence of phase transitions and offers insights into symmetry breaking, it does not accurately predict critical exponents because it neglects fluctuations, which become crucial near the critical point.

### Examples and Applications

- **Liquid-Gas Transition:** Near the critical point, the distinction between liquid and gas vanishes, leading to the phenomenon of critical opalescence, where the fluid becomes milky because of large density fluctuations.

- **Magnetism:** In ferromagnetic materials, the Curie point marks the critical temperature above which the material loses its spontaneous magnetization.

- **Superconductors and Superfluids:** These systems also exhibit critical phenomena as they transition into their superconducting or superfluid phases.

### Implications

The study of critical phenomena has profound implications for our understanding of phase transitions and the collective behavior of systems. It has influenced fields beyond traditional physics, including financial markets, traffic flow, and even neuroscience, through the application of concepts like scale invariance and universality. The insights gained from critical phenomena highlight the power of symmetry and scaling arguments in explaining the natural world, emphasizing the deep connections between seemingly disparate systems.
