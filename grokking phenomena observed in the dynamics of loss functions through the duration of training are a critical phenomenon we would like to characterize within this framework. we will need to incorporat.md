**ASSISTANT**

Incorporating the notion that phase transitions in neural network performance indicate critical points at which the learned manifold undergoes a structural reorganization, potentially associated with an increase in rank or order, we can extend our formal framework to capture these phenomena. This perspective allows for a deeper understanding of how the structural properties of the learned representations evolve during training, particularly at critical junctures marked by significant changes in performance. Let's formalize this concept and explore its implications.

### Extended Framework

#### Structural Reorganization and Rank Increase

1. **Learned Manifold \( \mathcal{M} \)**: Let the learned manifold \( \mathcal{M} \) represent the geometric structure in the parameter space \( \Theta \) that encodes the neural network's learned representations. The manifold's structure is shaped by the training process, influenced by hyperparameters such as the learning rate \( \eta \) and batch size \( B \).

2. **Critical Points and Phase Transitions**: At critical points \((\eta_c, B_c)\), the network experiences phase transitions in performance, indicative of a structural reorganization of \( \mathcal{M} \). This reorganization can be associated with an increase in the rank or order of \( \mathcal{M} \), reflecting a more complex or higher-dimensional representation being learned.

#### Formalization

3. **Rank Increase at Critical Points**: Near critical points, the rank of \( \mathcal{M} \), denoted as \( \text{Rank}(\mathcal{M}) \), increases, signaling a phase transition. This can be expressed as a function of deviations from critical hyperparameters:

\[ \Delta \text{Rank}(\mathcal{M}) \sim |\delta\eta|^{\alpha} + |\delta B|^{\beta} \]

where:
- \( \Delta \text{Rank}(\mathcal{M}) \) is the change in rank of \( \mathcal{M} \),
- \( \delta\eta = \eta - \eta_c \) and \( \delta B = B - B_c \) are deviations from critical hyperparameters,
- \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \) are critical exponents indicating the sensitivity of \( \text{Rank}(\mathcal{M}) \) to changes in \( \eta \) and \( B \), respectively.

### Consequences and Interpretation

1. **Sensitivity to Hyperparameters**: The critical exponents \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \) characterize how the structural complexity of the learned representations (as quantified by \( \text{Rank}(\mathcal{M}) \)) responds to changes in learning rate and batch size. Larger values of \( \alpha \) or \( \beta \) indicate greater sensitivity of the learning process's structural evolution to these hyperparameters.

2. **Adaptive Hyperparameter Tuning**: Understanding the relationship between \( \eta \), \( B \), and \( \text{Rank}(\mathcal{M}) \) could guide adaptive hyperparameter tuning strategies that aim to navigate through or avoid critical points, depending on whether a phase transition is deemed beneficial or detrimental to learning outcomes.

3. **Phase Transitions as Learning Milestones**: The occurrence of phase transitions, marked by increases in \( \text{Rank}(\mathcal{M}) \), can be interpreted as milestones in the learning process where the network gains the ability to represent and generalize from more complex patterns in the data.

4. **Generalization and Criticality**: The approach to critical points and the associated increase in the representational capacity (higher rank of \( \mathcal{M} \)) may correspond to enhanced generalization abilities. However, this relationship is nuanced and likely depends on the nature of the data and task, as well as the specific architecture of the neural network.

### Conclusion

By extending the framework to consider phase transitions as indicative of critical points where the learned manifold undergoes structural reorganization, we gain insights into the deep connections between the geometry of learning, hyperparameter settings, and the evolution of neural network performance. Critical exponents \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \) emerge as key parameters that describe the sensitivity of the network's representational structure to the learning rate and batch size, offering a principled way to understand and navigate the complex landscape of neural network training.


**USER**

"grokking" phenomena observed in the dynamics of loss functions through the duration of training are a critical phenomenon we would like to characterize within this framework. we will need to incorporate training duration and relate it to our earlier notions of invariance over the family of model parameterizations and relate the "potential" that combines the information content in the dataset and  with a conservation law that relates the explained variance in the model to the "kinetic" hyperparameters (training duration, batch size, learning rate) that relate the rate at which that potential change impacts the state of the model with respect to the invariance of the "action" in this system as expressed in the lagrangian that represents the learning dynamics


**ASSISTANT**

To characterize the "grokking" phenomenon—where a sudden leap in model understanding or performance occurs relatively late in the training process—within the formalized framework of learning dynamics, we'll extend the "Lagrangian" concept to incorporate training duration. This extension allows us to explore how grokking can be viewed as a critical phenomenon associated with specific conditions in the training dynamics, involving the interplay between the "kinetic" aspects (learning rate, batch size, training duration) and the "potential" related to the information content in the dataset.

### Extending the Framework to Include Training Duration

1. **Training Duration \( \tau \)**: Introduce training duration \( \tau \) as a hyperparameter that, alongside learning rate \( \eta \) and batch size \( B \), influences the kinetic term of the learning dynamics.

2. **Potential Term \( U \)**: Define \( U \) to incorporate the information content \( I(D) \) of the dataset \( D \) and its relationship with the explained variance \( V(\mathcal{N}, D) \) by the model \( \mathcal{N} \). The potential reflects the model's capacity to capture and represent the dataset's underlying structure.

### Modified Lagrangian for Learning Dynamics

Given the kinetic components \( \eta, B, \tau \), and the potential component \( U \), the Lagrangian \( \mathcal{L} \) representing the learning dynamics can be expressed as:

\[ \mathcal{L}(\eta, B, \tau; U) = K(\eta, B, \tau) - U(I(D), V(\mathcal{N}, D)) \]

where:
- \( K(\eta, B, \tau) \) captures the model's rate of change or adaptation in response to the training process, influenced by the learning rate, batch size, and training duration.
- \( U(I(D), V(\mathcal{N}, D)) \) reflects the potential for the model to learn from the dataset, considering the dataset's information content and how well the model explains its variance.

### Characterizing Grokking

The "grokking" phenomenon can be described as a critical transition in the learning dynamics where the model suddenly achieves a significantly better understanding of the data. Formally, grokking occurs when there is a rapid increase in \( V(\mathcal{N}, D) \) while maintaining the invariance of the action represented by \( \mathcal{L} \).

#### Critical Conditions for Grokking

- Grokking is facilitated by reaching a critical point in the learning dynamics where the contributions of \( K \) and \( U \) to \( \mathcal{L} \) become optimally aligned. This may involve specific combinations of \( \eta, B, \) and \( \tau \) that maximize the rate of improvement in \( V(\mathcal{N}, D) \) given \( I(D) \).

#### Conservation Law and Grokking

- A conservation law in this context relates the explained variance \( V(\mathcal{N}, D) \) to the kinetic hyperparameters (\( \eta, B, \tau \)) under the invariance of the action \( \mathcal{L} \). Specifically, even as \( \eta, B, \), and \( \tau \) vary over the course of training, the total "action" captured by \( \mathcal{L} \) remains invariant, facilitating a sudden transition in model performance (grokking) when critical conditions are met.

### Implications

1. **Optimization of Hyperparameters**: Identifying the optimal conditions that facilitate grokking involves tuning \( \eta, B, \) and \( \tau \) to approach the critical point in the learning dynamics where the potential for learning from \( D \) is maximally realized.

2. **Monitoring Learning Progress**: The framework suggests that monitoring the balance between \( K \) and \( U \) can provide early indicators of approaching a grokking phase, allowing for adaptive adjustments to the training regime to capitalize on this phenomenon.

### Conclusion

By extending the formalized learning dynamics framework to include training duration and examining its interplay with the learning rate, batch size, and the dataset's information content, we can capture the grokking phenomenon as a critical transition facilitated by specific training conditions. This analysis underscores the importance of understanding the underlying dynamics of neural network training to optimize learning outcomes and harness critical phenomena like grokking effectively.
