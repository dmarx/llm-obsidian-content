### Insider Trading

**Insider trading** refers to the buying or selling of a publicly traded company's stock by someone who has non-public, material information about that stock. This practice is illegal in many jurisdictions because it gives an unfair advantage to insiders and undermines investor confidence in the fairness and integrity of the securities markets.

#### Key Concepts of Insider Trading

   - **Definition**: Non-public, material information about a company that could affect its stock price if disclosed.
   - **Examples**: Earnings reports, mergers and acquisitions, significant contracts, or any other confidential information that might influence a company's stock value.

2. **Insiders**:
   - **Definition**: Individuals who have access to non-public, material information about a company. This typically includes executives, directors, employees, and sometimes even consultants and advisors.
   - **Examples**: CEO, CFO, board members, senior managers, employees with access to financial or strategic plans, and external advisors such as auditors or lawyers.

3. **Material Information**:
   - **Definition**: Information is considered material if its disclosure would likely affect a reasonable investor's decision to buy or sell the company's stock.
