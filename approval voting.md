**USER**

approval voting


**ASSISTANT**

**Approval Voting** is a simple yet powerful voting method where each voter can vote for ("approve of") as many candidates or options as they wish. Unlike traditional voting systems where each voter selects only one candidate (such as in plurality voting), approval voting allows voters to express support for all candidates they find acceptable. The candidate or option with the most approvals wins.

## Mechanics of Approval Voting

The procedure for approval voting is straightforward:

1. **Voting Process**: Each voter is presented with a list of candidates or options. Instead of choosing just one, the voter can select ("approve") any number of them. 
2. **Counting Votes**: Each selected candidate receives one vote. There is no limit to the number of candidates a voter can approve.
3. **Determining the Winner**: The candidate or option with the highest total number of approvals (i.e., votes) wins.

### Example

Consider a simple election with three candidates: Alice, Bob, and Carol. Each voter marks which of these candidates they approve of:

- Voter 1 approves Alice and Bob.
- Voter 2 approves Bob and Carol.
- Voter 3 approves Alice and Carol.
- Voter 4 approves only Alice.
- Voter 5 approves Bob.

The tally would be:

- **Alice**: 3 approvals
- **Bob**: 3 approvals
- **Carol**: 2 approvals

In this example, Alice and Bob are tied with the most approvals, so additional rules (like a runoff or a coin flip) might be needed to break the tie.

## Theoretical Advantages

Approval voting has several theoretical advantages over traditional voting systems like plurality or first-past-the-post:

1. **Expressiveness**: Voters can express support for all candidates they find acceptable, not just their top choice. This reduces the pressure to engage in [[tactical voting]] (voting for a less preferred candidate who has a better chance of winning) and allows for more honest voting.
   
2. **Reduced Spoiler Effect**: Since voters are not limited to approving only one candidate, the presence of a third-party or less popular candidate is less likely to "spoil" the election for a more preferred candidate. This can lead to outcomes that better reflect the true preferences of the electorate.

3. **Encouragement of Consensus Candidates**: Candidates who are broadly acceptable to many voters (even if not the most preferred by any single group) are more likely to win under approval voting. This can reduce polarization and encourage candidates to appeal to a wider audience.

4. **Simplicity**: The system is easy to understand and implement. Voters simply indicate which candidates they approve of, and the candidate with the most approvals wins. No complex counting methods are required.

## Strategic Considerations

While approval voting allows voters to express support for multiple candidates, it is still subject to some strategic considerations:

- **Approval Thresholds**: Voters need to decide who to approve. If they approve too many candidates, their vote might help elect a less-preferred candidate. If they approve too few, they risk not supporting a potentially acceptable winner. Voters must balance the desire to express true preferences with the strategic impact of their choices.
  
- **Favorite Betrayal**: Unlike systems like [[Ranked-Choice Voting]], approval voting can still lead to situations where voters might choose not to approve their favorite candidate if doing so could help elect a less-preferred one. This issue is less severe than in plurality voting but is still present.

## Applications and Use Cases

Approval voting has been used and proposed for various decision-making contexts:

1. **Organizational Elections**: Several organizations and societies use approval voting to elect officers and make decisions, benefiting from its simplicity and ability to reflect the preferences of the group more accurately.
   
2. **Public Elections**: Some municipalities and political organizations have experimented with or advocated for approval voting in public elections. It has been used in local elections in places like Fargo, North Dakota, and is considered for wider adoption.

3. **Polls and Surveys**: Approval voting is frequently used in informal settings, such as online polls or surveys, where multiple selections are allowed, and the goal is to gauge overall approval or support for various options.

## Limitations and Criticisms

Despite its advantages, approval voting is not without its criticisms and limitations:

1. **Lack of Ranked Preferences**: Approval voting does not capture the intensity or ranking of preferences. It only indicates which candidates are acceptable, not the relative strength of preference between them.

2. **Strategic Voting**: Although approval voting reduces some forms of strategic manipulation, voters still need to consider how their approvals might affect the outcome, potentially leading to insincere voting.

3. **Potential for Non-Majoritarian Outcomes**: In some scenarios, a candidate with broad but shallow support could win over a candidate who is the strong favorite of a majority, especially if the majority does not also approve of the broadly supported candidate.

Approval voting is a versatile and straightforward voting method that offers an improvement over traditional single-choice systems by allowing voters to express support for multiple candidates or options. While it addresses some of the limitations of plurality voting, it is not a panacea and must be carefully considered in context-specific applications.
