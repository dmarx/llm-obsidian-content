# Classes of Non-Zero-Sum Games in Evolutionary Game Theory

[[Non-zero-sum games]] constitute a central focus in [[evolutionary game theory]] (EGT), as they model situations where the total payoff to all players varies based on their strategic choices. Unlike [[zero-sum games]] where one player's gain exactly equals another's loss, non-zero-sum games better represent the majority of natural and social interactions where cooperation, coordination, or conflict can create or destroy value. These games provide a mathematical framework for understanding the evolution of various behaviors in biological, social, and economic systems.

## Taxonomy of Non-Zero-Sum Games

The major classes of non-zero-sum games in EGT can be organized along several key dimensions:

### 1. Cooperation-Competition Spectrum

#### Pure Coordination Games

[[Pure coordination games]] represent situations where players benefit by making the same choices. For a symmetric $2 \times 2$ game, the general form is:

$$A = \begin{pmatrix} 
a & c \\
d & b
\end{pmatrix}$$

Where $a > d$ and $b > c$, creating two [[Nash equilibria]] at $(a,a)$ and $(b,b)$.

Examples include:
- [[Language conventions]]
- [[Driving side]] (left vs. right)
- [[Technology standards]]

The [[replicator dynamics]] for these games typically show bistability, with outcomes depending on initial conditions.

#### Anti-Coordination Games

[[Anti-coordination games]] model scenarios where players benefit by making different choices. The payoff structure is:

$$A = \begin{pmatrix} 
a & c \\
d & b
\end{pmatrix}$$

Where $c > a$ and $d > b$, creating two pure strategy Nash equilibria.

Examples include:
- [[Resource partitioning]] in ecological niches
- [[Division of labor]] in social insects
- [[Frequency-dependent selection]] in morphological traits

#### Mixed-Motive Games

[[Mixed-motive games]] involve both cooperative and competitive elements, creating strategic tension. The most prominent examples include:

1. **[[Prisoner's Dilemma]]**:
   
   $$A = \begin{pmatrix} 
   R & S \\
   T & P
   \end{pmatrix}$$
   
   Where $T > R > P > S$ and typically $2R > T + S$ for repeated versions.

2. **[[Snowdrift Game]]** (Hawk-Dove, Chicken):
   
   $$A = \begin{pmatrix} 
   B-C/2 & B-C \\
   B & 0
   \end{pmatrix}$$
   
   Where $B > C > 0$.

3. **[[Stag Hunt]]**:
   
   $$A = \begin{pmatrix} 
   a & c \\
   d & b
   \end{pmatrix}$$
   
   Where $a > d \geq b > c$, creating a payoff-dominant equilibrium $(a,a)$ and a risk-dominant equilibrium $(b,b)$.

### 2. Number of Equilibria

#### Single-Equilibrium Games

Games with a unique equilibrium include:
- [[Matching Pennies]] (mixed strategy equilibrium)
- [[Rock-Paper-Scissors]] (mixed strategy equilibrium)
- Standard [[Prisoner's Dilemma]] (pure strategy equilibrium)

#### Multi-Equilibrium Games

Games with multiple equilibria create more complex evolutionary dynamics:
- [[Battle of the Sexes]]
- [[Coordination Games]]
- [[Bach or Stravinsky Game]]

For games with multiple equilibria, the concept of [[basin of attraction]] becomes important, defined for equilibrium $\mathbf{x}^*$ as:

$$B(\mathbf{x}^*) = \{\mathbf{y} \in \Delta | \lim_{t \to \infty} \Phi_t(\mathbf{y}) = \mathbf{x}^*\}$$

Where $\Phi_t$ is the flow of the dynamic system.

### 3. Dynamical Behavior

#### Convergent Games

[[Convergent games]] lead to stable equilibria under replicator dynamics. Examples include:
- [[Dominant Strategy Games]]
- [[Potential Games]]

For [[potential games]], there exists a function $V: \Delta \to \mathbb{R}$ such that:

$$\frac{\partial V(\mathbf{x})}{\partial x_i} = f_i(\mathbf{x}) - \phi(\mathbf{x})$$

This guarantees convergence to a Nash equilibrium.

#### Cyclic Games

[[Cyclic games]] exhibit oscillatory or rotating behavior in strategy space. The canonical example is [[Rock-Paper-Scissors]], with payoff matrix:

$$A = \begin{pmatrix} 
0 & -1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & -1 \\
-1 & 1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}$$

The replicator dynamics create closed orbits in the interior of the simplex. More generally, for a cyclic game with $n$ strategies and payoff matrix $A$, if $A$ is [[skew-symmetric]] ($A + A^T = 0$), then the dynamics are volume-preserving.

#### Chaotic Games

[[Chaotic games]] display sensitive dependence on initial conditions. These typically involve four or more strategies with complex payoff structures. The [[Lyapunov exponent]] $\lambda$ quantifies the rate of exponential divergence:

$$\lambda = \lim_{t \to \infty} \frac{1}{t} \log \frac{||\delta \mathbf{x}(t)||}{||\delta \mathbf{x}(0)||}$$

Where $\delta \mathbf{x}(t)$ represents a small perturbation at time $t$.

## Signaling and Information Games

### Costly Signaling Games

[[Costly signaling games]] model communication where signals have different costs for different types of senders. The general form includes:
- A set of sender types $T$
- A set of possible signals $S$
- A set of receiver responses $R$
- Type-dependent payoff functions $u_S(t,s,r)$ and $u_R(t,s,r)$

[[Zahavi's handicap principle]] provides a biological interpretation: signals must be costly to be reliable.

### Cheap Talk Games

[[Cheap talk games]] involve cost-free signaling between players. A general formulation is:
- Sender type space $T$ with distribution $F(t)$
- Message space $M$
- Action space $A$
- Utility functions $u_S(t,m,a)$ and $u_R(t,m,a)$

These games often result in [[babbling equilibria]] where signals carry no information.

## Multi-Player Extensions

### N-Person Social Dilemmas

[[N-person social dilemmas]] extend two-player games to larger groups:

1. **[[Public Goods Game]]**: Each player $i$ contributes $c_i \in [0, C]$ to a common pool, which is multiplied by $r$ and distributed equally. The payoff is:

   $$\pi_i = e - c_i + r\frac{\sum_{j=1}^n c_j}{n}$$

   Where $1 < r < n$ creates the dilemma.

2. **[[Threshold Public Goods Game]]**: The public good is provided only if contributions exceed a threshold $T$:

   $$\pi_i = \begin{cases}
   e - c_i + b & \text{if } \sum_{j=1}^n c_j \geq T \\
   e - c_i & \text{otherwise}
   \end{cases}$$

3. **[[Common-Pool Resource Game]]**: Players extract from a shared resource with optimal sustainable yield:

   $$\pi_i = e_i \left(1 - \frac{\sum_{j=1}^n e_j}{K}\right)$$

   Where $e_i$ is extraction effort and $K$ is the resource's carrying capacity.

### Collective Risk Games

[[Collective risk games]] incorporate uncertain future impacts:

$$\pi_i = \begin{cases}
w_i - c_i & \text{with probability } p(\sum c_j) \\
0 & \text{with probability } 1-p(\sum c_j)
\end{cases}$$

Where $p(\sum c_j)$ is the probability of avoiding catastrophe, increasing with total contributions.

## Theoretical Frameworks

### Adaptive Dynamics

[[Adaptive dynamics]] studies the evolution of continuous strategies through trait substitution sequences. For a resident strategy $x$ and mutant strategy $y$, the invasion fitness is:

$$S_x(y) = f(y,x) - f(x,x)$$

If $S_x(y) > 0$, the mutant can invade. The selection gradient is:

$$D(x) = \left. \frac{\partial f(y,x)}{\partial y} \right|_{y=x}$$

### Inclusive Fitness Theory

[[Inclusive fitness theory]] extends payoffs to account for genetic relatedness:

$$W_i = \sum_{j=1}^n r_{ij} \pi_j$$

Where $r_{ij}$ is the relatedness coefficient between individuals $i$ and $j$.

## Applications and Empirical Evidence

### Biological Systems

Non-zero-sum games model numerous biological phenomena:
1. **[[Mating strategies]]**: Alternative reproductive tactics
2. **[[Cooperation in microbes]]**: Production of public goods molecules
3. **[[Plant competition]]**: Root architecture and canopy structure

### Economic and Social Systems

Applications extend to human social systems:
1. **[[Market competition]]**: Product differentiation and pricing strategies
2. **[[International relations]]**: Arms races and environmental agreements
3. **[[Social norms]]**: Enforcement of cooperative behavior

## Mathematical Challenges and Future Directions

### High-Dimensional Strategy Spaces

For continuous strategy spaces $X \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, the replicator equation becomes:

$$\frac{\partial p(x,t)}{\partial t} = p(x,t) \left[ f(x, p_t) - \bar{f}(p_t) \right]$$

Where $p(x,t)$ is the distribution of strategies at time $t$.

### Stochastic and Finite Population Models

For finite populations of size $N$, the [[Moran process]] gives transition probabilities:

$$P_{i,i+1} = \frac{i(N-i)f_A}{if_A + (N-i)f_B} \cdot \frac{N-i}{N}$$
$$P_{i,i-1} = \frac{i(N-i)f_B}{if_A + (N-i)f_B} \cdot \frac{i}{N}$$

Where $f_A$ and $f_B$ are the fitness values of strategies $A$ and $B$.

### Non-Equilibrium Theory

Recent work focuses on non-equilibrium dynamics, using tools from:
1. **[[Statistical physics]]**: Entropy production and fluctuation theorems
2. **[[Network theory]]**: Dynamics on complex interaction topologies
3. **[[Information theory]]**: Information flow and processing in strategic interactions

## Philosophical and Theoretical Implications

### Evolution of Cooperation

The [[evolution of cooperation]] remains a central question in EGT, with mechanisms including:
1. **[[Direct reciprocity]]**: Repeated interactions (e.g., [[Tit-for-Tat]])
2. **[[Indirect reciprocity]]**: Reputation-based cooperation
3. **[[Network reciprocity]]**: Spatial structure enabling cooperator clustering
4. **[[Group selection]]**: Competition between groups with different cooperation levels
5. **[[Kin selection]]**: Cooperation based on genetic relatedness

### Emergence of Complexity

Non-zero-sum games provide insight into how complex adaptive systems emerge through the interplay of competing and cooperating entities, potentially explaining major [[evolutionary transitions]] in complexity.

The mathematical study of non-zero-sum games continues to expand, integrating methods from dynamical systems, statistical physics, information theory, and complexity science to understand the evolutionary foundations of biological and social complexity.
