Savage's Axioms

### Savage's Axioms

Savage's axioms are a set of principles proposed by the statistician and economist Leonard J. Savage in his foundational work on subjective expected [[utility theory]]. These axioms provide a formal basis for making rational decisions under uncertainty by ensuring that preferences over uncertain outcomes can be represented by a utility function and subjective probabilities.

#### 1. **Background and Significance**

- **Subjective Expected Utility Theory**: Savage's framework integrates personal (subjective) beliefs about uncertainty with preferences over outcomes. The theory allows for the derivation of a utility function and a subjective probability distribution that together describe a decision-maker's preferences.

- **Rational Decision-Making**: The axioms aim to characterize rational behavior by specifying conditions under which an individual's preferences can be represented as maximizing expected utility.

#### 2. **Savage's Axioms**

Savage proposed seven axioms to underpin subjective expected [[utility theory]]. These axioms define properties that preferences must satisfy to ensure they can be represented by a utility function and subjective probabilities.

1. **Order**: Preferences are complete and transitive.
   - **Completeness**: For any two acts $f$ and $g$, the decision-maker either prefers $f$ to $g$, prefers $g$ to $f$, or is indifferent between them.
     $$ \forall f, g \; (f \succ g \text{ or } g \succ f \text{ or } f \sim g) $$
   - **Transitivity**: If $f$ is preferred to $g$ and $g$ is preferred to $h$, then $f$ is preferred to $h$.
     $$ \forall f, g, h \; (f \succ g \text{ and } g \succ h \Rightarrow f \succ h) $$

2. **Sure-Thing Principle (Independence)**: If a decision-maker prefers act $f$ to act $g$ given some event $A$, and also prefers $f$ to $g$ given the complement of $A$, then they should prefer $f$ to $g$ unconditionally.
   - **Example**: If you prefer a vacation to Hawaii over a vacation to Alaska whether it rains or not, then you prefer the vacation to Hawaii unconditionally.
     $$ f_A h \succ g_A h \text{ and } f_{\neg A} h \succ g_{\neg A} h \Rightarrow f \succ g $$

3. **State Independence**: The preference between acts depends only on the outcomes, not on how the outcomes are assigned to states of the world.

4. **Measurability**: There exists at least one non-trivial partition of the state space such that preferences between acts can be expressed in terms of the probabilities of these events.

5. **Continuity**: For any three acts $f$, $g$, and $h$ where $f \succ g \succ h$, there exists a probability $p \in (0, 1)$ such that the decision-maker is indifferent between $g$ and a lottery that yields $f$ with probability $p$ and $h$ with probability $(1-p)$.
   - **Example**: If you prefer $f$ to $g$ and $g$ to $h$, there is some probability mix of $f$ and $h$ that makes you indifferent to $g$.

     $$ \exists p \in (0, 1) \; \text{such that} \; g \sim p f + (1-p) h $$

6. **Non-Triviality**: There are at least two outcomes where the decision-maker has a strict preference for one over the other.

7. **P3 (Substitutability)**: If two acts yield the same outcomes in every state of the world, then the decision-maker should be indifferent between them.

#### 3. **Deriving Subjective Expected Utility**

Given that a decision-maker's preferences satisfy Savage's axioms, it is possible to derive a utility function $u$ and a subjective probability measure $P$ such that the decision-maker's preferences can be represented by the expected utility:

$$ EU(f) = \sum_{s \in S} P(s) u(f(s)) $$

Here:
- $S$ is the set of states of the world.
- $f(s)$ is the outcome of act $f$ in state $s$.
- $u(f(s))$ is the utility of the outcome $f(s)$.
- $P(s)$ is the subjective probability of state $s$.

#### 4. **Philosophical and Practical Implications**

- **Rationality**: Savage's axioms provide a formal definition of [[rational decision-making]] under uncertainty. They ensure consistency in preferences and allow for a coherent representation of beliefs and values.
- **Subjective Probabilities**: The framework acknowledges that individuals have personal beliefs about the likelihood of uncertain events, captured by subjective probabilities rather than objective frequencies.
- **Utility Representation**: By deriving a utility function, the axioms enable a quantitative representation of preferences, facilitating comparisons and decisions across different scenarios.

#### 5. **Criticisms and Limitations**

- **Realism**: Some critics argue that the axioms, particularly the sure-thing principle and state independence, may not accurately reflect real human behavior, which can be influenced by context, framing effects, and psychological biases.
- **Complexity**: The formalism of Savage's axioms can be complex and challenging to apply in practical decision-making situations, especially when individuals have difficulty articulating their preferences and probabilities.
- **Ambiguity Aversion**: The axioms assume that decision-makers can form subjective probabilities for all events, but in reality, individuals often exhibit ambiguity aversion, where they prefer known risks over unknown risks.

#### 6. **Applications and Extensions**

- **Economic Modeling**: Savage's axioms underpin much of modern economic theory, particularly in areas related to consumer choice, market behavior, and game theory.
- **Decision Analysis**: The framework is used in decision analysis and operations research to guide [[rational decision-making]] in uncertain environments.
- **Behavioral Economics**: Extensions and modifications of Savage's axioms have been proposed to account for observed deviations from rational behavior, such as prospect theory, which incorporates psychological factors into the decision-making process.

### Conclusion

Savage's axioms provide a rigorous foundation for subjective expected [[utility theory]], defining conditions under which preferences under uncertainty can be represented by a utility function and subjective probabilities. While the axioms offer a powerful framework for [[rational decision-making]], they also face criticisms and limitations related to their realism and complexity. Understanding these axioms enriches our comprehension of decision theory and its applications across various domains, from economics to psychology.
