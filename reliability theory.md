**Reliability theory** is a mathematical framework for analyzing the [[time-to-failure]] behavior of systems, components, and processes under uncertainty. Rooted in [[probability theory]] and [[stochastic processes]], reliability theory provides the foundational mathematical structures for understanding [[system dependability]], [[failure mechanisms]], and [[maintenance optimization]]. The field encompasses both the probabilistic modeling of failure phenomena and the engineering principles for designing reliable systems across diverse applications from [[aerospace engineering]] to [[software systems]].

## Mathematical Foundations

### Basic Probability Structure

Let $T$ denote the [[random failure time]] of a system or component, where $T: \Omega \to \mathbb{R}^+$ on a probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$. The fundamental reliability functions are:

**Reliability Function (Survival Function)**:
$$R(t) = P(T > t) = 1 - F(t)$$

**Cumulative Distribution Function**:
$$F(t) = P(T \leq t) = \int_0^t f(s) ds$$

**Probability Density Function**:
$$f(t) = \frac{dF(t)}{dt} = -\frac{dR(t)}{dt}$$

**Hazard Function (Failure Rate)**:
$$h(t) = \frac{f(t)}{R(t)} = -\frac{d \log R(t)}{dt}$$

### Fundamental Relationships

The hazard function provides an alternative characterization through the [[cumulative hazard function]]:

$$H(t) = \int_0^t h(s) ds = -\log R(t)$$

This yields the fundamental relationship:
$$R(t) = \exp(-H(t)) = \exp\left(-\int_0^t h(s) ds\right)$$

The [[mean residual life function]] represents expected remaining lifetime:
$$m(t) = E[T - t | T > t] = \frac{1}{R(t)} \int_t^{\infty} R(s) ds$$

### Aging Characteristics

Systems exhibit different [[aging patterns]] characterized by hazard function behavior:

**Increasing Failure Rate (IFR)**: $h'(t) > 0$ (deteriorating systems)
**Decreasing Failure Rate (DFR)**: $h'(t) < 0$ (improving systems)
**Constant Failure Rate (CFR)**: $h'(t) = 0$ (memoryless systems)

### Life Distribution Classes

**IFR Class**: $\mathcal{I} = \{F : h_F \text{ is increasing}\}$
**DFR Class**: $\mathcal{D} = \{F : h_F \text{ is decreasing}\}$
**IFRA Class**: $\{F : H(t)/t \text{ is increasing}\}$ ([[Increasing Failure Rate Average]])
**DFRA Class**: $\{F : H(t)/t \text{ is decreasing}\}$ ([[Decreasing Failure Rate Average]])

## Classical Reliability Distributions

### Exponential Distribution

The [[exponential distribution]] with parameter $\lambda > 0$ serves as the foundation:

$$f(t) = \lambda e^{-\lambda t}, \quad R(t) = e^{-\lambda t}, \quad h(t) = \lambda$$

**Properties**:
- Constant failure rate (memoryless property)
- $E[T] = 1/\lambda$, $\text{Var}(T) = 1/\lambda^2$
- [[Memoryless property]]: $P(T > s + t | T > s) = P(T > t)$

### Weibull Distribution

The [[Weibull distribution]] with shape $\beta > 0$ and scale $\eta > 0$ parameters:

$$f(t) = \frac{\beta}{\eta}\left(\frac{t}{\eta}\right)^{\beta-1} \exp\left(-\left(\frac{t}{\eta}\right)^{\beta}\right)$$

$$R(t) = \exp\left(-\left(\frac{t}{\eta}\right)^{\beta}\right), \quad h(t) = \frac{\beta}{\eta}\left(\frac{t}{\eta}\right)^{\beta-1}$$

**Aging Behavior**:
- $\beta < 1$: DFR (early failure, burn-in period)
- $\beta = 1$: CFR (exponential distribution)
- $\beta > 1$: IFR (wear-out, aging)

### Gamma Distribution

The [[Gamma distribution]] with shape $\alpha > 0$ and rate $\lambda > 0$:

$$f(t) = \frac{\lambda^\alpha}{\Gamma(\alpha)} t^{\alpha-1} e^{-\lambda t}$$

**Hazard Function**: For $\alpha > 1$, the hazard is increasing and asymptotically approaches $\lambda$.

### Log-Normal Distribution

With parameters $\mu \in \mathbb{R}$ and $\sigma > 0$:

$$f(t) = \frac{1}{t\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} \exp\left(-\frac{(\log t - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)$$

The hazard function exhibits a [[bathtub shape]] with initial increase, maximum, then decrease.

### Log-Logistic Distribution

With shape $\beta > 0$ and scale $\alpha > 0$:

$$F(t) = \frac{1}{1 + (t/\alpha)^{-\beta}}, \quad h(t) = \frac{\beta t^{\beta-1}}{\alpha^\beta + t^\beta}$$

**Properties**:
- For $\beta \leq 1$: decreasing hazard
- For $\beta > 1$: unimodal hazard (increasing then decreasing)

## System Reliability

### Series Systems

For a [[series system]] with $n$ components having reliability functions $R_i(t)$, system reliability is:

$$R_s(t) = \prod_{i=1}^n R_i(t)$$

For independent components with constant failure rates $\lambda_i$:
$$R_s(t) = \exp\left(-\sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i t\right)$$

The system failure rate is the sum of component failure rates:
$$h_s(t) = \sum_{i=1}^n h_i(t)$$

### Parallel Systems

For a [[parallel system]] (redundant configuration):

$$R_s(t) = 1 - \prod_{i=1}^n (1 - R_i(t)) = 1 - \prod_{i=1}^n F_i(t)$$

For identical components with reliability $R(t)$:
$$R_s(t) = 1 - (1 - R(t))^n$$

### k-out-of-n Systems

A [[k-out-of-n system]] functions if at least $k$ out of $n$ components function. For identical components:

$$R_s(t) = \sum_{j=k}^n \binom{n}{j} R(t)^j (1-R(t))^{n-j}$$

**Special Cases**:
- $k = 1$: Parallel system
- $k = n$: Series system

### Complex Systems

For general system structures, the [[structure function]] $\phi(\mathbf{x})$ maps component states $\mathbf{x} = (x_1, \ldots, x_n) \in \{0,1\}^n$ to system state:

$$R_s(t) = E[\phi(X_1(t), \ldots, X_n(t))]$$

where $X_i(t) = I(T_i > t)$ are component state indicators.

### Minimal Path and Cut Sets

**Minimal Path Set**: $P \subseteq \{1, \ldots, n\}$ such that system functions when all components in $P$ function, and no proper subset has this property.

**Minimal Cut Set**: $C \subseteq \{1, \ldots, n\}$ such that system fails when all components in $C$ fail, and no proper subset has this property.

**Reliability Bounds**:
$$1 - \prod_{j=1}^r \left(1 - \prod_{i \in C_j} R_i(t)\right) \leq R_s(t) \leq \prod_{j=1}^s \left(1 - \prod_{i \in P_j} (1-R_i(t))\right)$$

## Network Reliability

### Graph-Theoretic Formulation

Consider a [[stochastic network]] represented by graph $G = (V, E)$ with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$. Each edge $e \in E$ operates independently with probability $p_e$.

**Terminal Reliability**: Probability that vertices $s$ and $t$ are connected:
$$R_{s,t} = P(\text{path exists from } s \text{ to } t)$$

**k-Terminal Reliability**: Probability that a specified subset $K \subset V$ of vertices are all connected.

**All-Terminal Reliability**: Probability that the network is connected:
$$R_{all} = P(G \text{ is connected})$$

### Reliability Polynomials

The [[reliability polynomial]] for a graph $G$ is:

$$R_G(p) = \sum_{H \subseteq G} p^{|E(H)|} (1-p)^{|E(G)| - |E(H)|} I(H \text{ satisfies connectivity})$$

### Network Reduction Techniques

**Series Reduction**: Edges in series can be replaced by single edge with reliability $p_1 p_2$.

**Parallel Reduction**: Edges in parallel can be replaced by single edge with reliability $1 - (1-p_1)(1-p_2)$.

**Delta-Wye Transformation**: Complex network transformations preserving reliability properties.

## Accelerated Testing

### Accelerated Failure Time Models

Under [[stress acceleration]], the relationship between normal and accelerated conditions follows:

$$T_{\text{normal}} = T_{\text{accelerated}} \cdot \text{AF}(S)$$

where $\text{AF}(S)$ is the [[acceleration factor]] at stress level $S$.

### Arrhenius Model

For temperature acceleration:
$$\text{AF}(T) = \exp\left(\frac{E_a}{k}\left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{use}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{test}}}\right)\right)$$

where:
- $E_a$ is the [[activation energy]]
- $k$ is [[Boltzmann's constant]]
- $T$ is absolute temperature

### Power Law Model

For non-thermal stresses:
$$\text{AF}(S) = \left(\frac{S_{\text{test}}}{S_{\text{use}}}\right)^n$$

where $n$ is the [[stress exponent]].

### Eyring Model

General relationship for multiple stress factors:
$$\lambda(S_1, \ldots, S_k) = A \prod_{i=1}^k S_i^{n_i} \exp\left(\sum_{j=1}^m \frac{B_j}{S_j}\right)$$

## Maintenance Models

### Preventive Maintenance

**Age Replacement Policy**: Replace component at age $T$ or failure, whichever occurs first.

**Expected Cost Rate**:
$$C(T) = \frac{c_p R(T) + c_f F(T)}{\int_0^T R(t) dt}$$

where $c_p$ is preventive replacement cost and $c_f$ is failure replacement cost.

**Optimal Replacement Time**: $T^* = \arg\min C(T)$

### Minimal Repair Model

Under [[minimal repair]], the system is restored to its state just before failure. The [[intensity function]] for a [[non-homogeneous Poisson process]] is:

$$\lambda(t) = \rho h(t)$$

where $h(t)$ is the baseline hazard and $\rho$ is the [[repair effectiveness]] parameter.

### Imperfect Maintenance

**Brown-Proschan Model**: After maintenance, system age reduces by factor $\delta \in [0,1]$:
$$\text{Virtual age after maintenance} = \delta \cdot \text{age before maintenance}$$

**Kijima Model**: Virtual age evolution:
$$V_{n+1} = (V_n + X_n)q_n$$

where $X_n$ is the $n$-th inter-failure time and $q_n \in [0,1]$ is maintenance effectiveness.

## Statistical Inference

### Maximum Likelihood Estimation

For complete data $\{t_1, \ldots, t_n\}$, the likelihood function is:
$$L(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \prod_{i=1}^n f(t_i; \boldsymbol{\theta})$$

For censored data with censoring indicators $\{\delta_i\}$:
$$L(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \prod_{i=1}^n f(t_i; \boldsymbol{\theta})^{\delta_i} R(t_i; \boldsymbol{\theta})^{1-\delta_i}$$

### Kaplan-Meier Estimator

For non-parametric reliability estimation:
$$\hat{R}(t) = \prod_{t_i \leq t} \left(1 - \frac{d_i}{n_i}\right)$$

where $d_i$ is the number of failures at time $t_i$ and $n_i$ is the number at risk.

### Nelson-Aalen Estimator

For cumulative hazard estimation:
$$\hat{H}(t) = \sum_{t_i \leq t} \frac{d_i}{n_i}$$

### Confidence Intervals

**Exponential Distribution**: For parameter $\lambda$ with complete data:
$$\frac{2n\lambda}{\hat{\lambda}} \sim \chi^2_{2n}$$

**Weibull Distribution**: Using [[Fisher information matrix]] for asymptotic confidence intervals:
$$\sqrt{n}(\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}} - \boldsymbol{\theta}) \xrightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}(0, \mathcal{I}^{-1}(\boldsymbol{\theta}))$$

## Bayesian Reliability

### Prior Specifications

**Exponential Model**: Conjugate [[Gamma prior]]:
$$\lambda \sim \text{Gamma}(\alpha, \beta)$$

**Posterior**: $\lambda | \mathbf{t} \sim \text{Gamma}(\alpha + n, \beta + \sum t_i)$

**Weibull Model**: Independent priors:
$$\beta \sim \text{Gamma}(a, b), \quad \eta \sim \text{Gamma}(c, d)$$

### Non-Parametric Bayesian Methods

**Dirichlet Process**: For unknown failure distribution:
$$F \sim \text{DP}(\alpha, F_0)$$

where $\alpha$ is concentration parameter and $F_0$ is base distribution.

**Beta Process**: For random hazard measures:
$$H \sim \text{BP}(\alpha, \beta, H_0)$$

### Hierarchical Models

For multiple systems with common prior:
$$\theta_i | \phi \sim \pi(\theta | \phi), \quad \phi \sim \pi(\phi)$$

## Competing Risks in Reliability

### Multiple Failure Modes

When components can fail from $K$ different causes with cause-specific hazards $h_j(t)$:

**Overall Hazard**: $h(t) = \sum_{j=1}^K h_j(t)$

**Cause-Specific Reliability**: $R_j(t) = \exp(-\int_0^t h_j(s) ds)$

**Overall Reliability**: $R(t) = \prod_{j=1}^K R_j(t)$ (under independence)

### Cumulative Incidence Functions

Probability of failure from cause $j$ by time $t$:
$$F_j(t) = \int_0^t h_j(s) R(s) ds$$

## Software Reliability

### Software Reliability Growth Models

**Jelinski-Moranda Model**: 
$$h(t | N, \phi) = \phi(N - (i-1))$$

where $N$ is initial fault count and $\phi$ is fault detection rate.

**Goel-Okumoto Model**: 
$$m(t) = a(1 - e^{-bt})$$

where $m(t)$ is expected cumulative failures and $a, b > 0$ are parameters.

**Yamada S-Shaped Model**:
$$m(t) = a\left(1 - \left(1 + bt\right)e^{-bt}\right)$$

### Software Metrics

**Mean Time to Failure**: $\text{MTTF} = \int_0^{\infty} R(t) dt$

**Failure Intensity**: $\lambda(t) = \frac{dm(t)}{dt}$

**Reliability Growth Rate**: $\frac{d\lambda(t)}{dt}$

## Advanced Topics

### Multi-State Reliability Models

For systems with multiple degradation states $\{0, 1, \ldots, k\}$:

**Transition Intensities**: $\lambda_{ij}(t) = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{P(X(t+\Delta t) = j | X(t) = i)}{\Delta t}$

**State Probabilities**: $p_j(t) = P(X(t) = j)$

**Kolmogorov Equations**:
$$\frac{dp_j(t)}{dt} = \sum_{i \neq j} p_i(t)\lambda_{ij}(t) - p_j(t)\sum_{i \neq j} \lambda_{ji}(t)$$

### Shock Models

**Cumulative Shock Model**: System fails when cumulative shock exceeds threshold:
$$T = \inf\left\{t : \sum_{i=1}^{N(t)} Y_i > c\right\}$$

where $N(t)$ is shock arrival process and $Y_i$ are shock magnitudes.

**Extreme Shock Model**: System fails when single shock exceeds threshold:
$$T = \inf\{t : Y_{N(t)} > c\}$$

### Load-Sharing Systems

When components share system load, failure of one component increases load on survivors:

$$h_i(t) = h_{i0}(t) \cdot g\left(\frac{L(t)}{n(t)}\right)$$

where $L(t)$ is total load and $n(t)$ is number of functioning components.

## Reliability Optimization

### Redundancy Allocation

**Objective**: Maximize system reliability subject to constraints:
$$\max R_s(\mathbf{x}) \text{ subject to } \sum_{i=1}^n c_i x_i \leq C, \quad x_i \in \mathbb{Z}^+$$

where $x_i$ is redundancy level for subsystem $i$.

**Series-Parallel Systems**:
$$R_s(\mathbf{x}) = \prod_{i=1}^n \left(1 - (1-R_i)^{x_i}\right)$$

### Optimal Design

**Reliability-Cost Trade-off**: Minimize cost subject to reliability constraint:
$$\min \sum_{i=1}^n c_i(x_i) \text{ subject to } R_s(\mathbf{x}) \geq R_0$$

### Dynamic Programming Approach

For separable objective functions:
$$f_i(w) = \max_{1 \leq x_i \leq u_i} \{g_i(x_i) + f_{i+1}(w - w_i(x_i))\}$$

## Survival-Stress Analysis

### Stress-Strength Interference

System reliability when stress $X$ and strength $Y$ are random:
$$R = P(Y > X) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} F_X(y) f_Y(y) dy$$

For normal distributions:
$$R = \Phi\left(\frac{\mu_Y - \mu_X}{\sqrt{\sigma_X^2 + \sigma_Y^2}}\right)$$

### Time-Dependent Stress-Strength

When both stress and strength evolve over time:
$$R(t) = P(Y(t) > X(t))$$

## Computational Methods

### Monte Carlo Simulation

**Crude Monte Carlo**: Generate $N$ system replications:
$$\hat{R} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N I(\text{system}_i \text{ functions})$$

**Importance Sampling**: Use alternative distribution $g(\mathbf{x})$:
$$\hat{R} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N I(\phi(\mathbf{X}_i) = 1) \frac{f(\mathbf{X}_i)}{g(\mathbf{X}_i)}$$

**Variance Reduction**: 
- [[Control variates]]
- [[Antithetic variables]]  
- [[Stratified sampling]]

### Rare Event Simulation

**RESTART Method**: Use restart levels to focus on rare events.

**Splitting Method**: Clone particles approaching failure region.

**Cross-Entropy Method**: Adaptive importance sampling using:
$$\hat{\gamma} = \arg\min_{\gamma} \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N I(S(\mathbf{X}_i) \geq \gamma) \log f(\mathbf{X}_i; \gamma)$$

## Physics-Based Reliability

### Degradation Models

**Linear Degradation**: $X(t) = X_0 + \mu t + \sigma W(t)$

**Gamma Process**: For monotonic degradation:
$$X(t) \sim \text{Gamma}(\alpha(t), \beta)$$

with $\alpha(t)$ increasing shape function.

**Inverse Gaussian Process**: 
$$\text{IG}(\mu t, \lambda t^2)$$

### Crack Growth Models

**Paris Law**: $\frac{da}{dN} = C(\Delta K)^m$

where $a$ is crack length, $N$ is cycle count, and $\Delta K$ is stress intensity range.

**Probabilistic Extension**:
$$\frac{da}{dN} = C(\Delta K)^m \exp(\epsilon)$$

where $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$.

## Machine Learning in Reliability

### Neural Networks for Reliability

**Reliability Function Approximation**:
$$\hat{R}(t; \mathbf{X}) = \text{NN}(t, \mathbf{X}; \boldsymbol{\theta})$$

**Physics-Informed Neural Networks**:
$$\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{data}} + \lambda \mathcal{L}_{\text{physics}}$$

where $\mathcal{L}_{\text{physics}}$ enforces reliability function properties.

### Deep Learning for Failure Prediction

**Recurrent Neural Networks**: For sequential sensor data:
$$\mathbf{h}_t = f(\mathbf{W}_{hh}\mathbf{h}_{t-1} + \mathbf{W}_{xh}\mathbf{x}_t)$$

**Convolutional Neural Networks**: For image-based defect detection.

**Transformer Models**: For long-range dependencies in failure data.

## Symbolic Notation Framework

Let $\mathcal{R}(\mathcal{T}, \mathcal{S}, \mathcal{F})$ denote a reliability system with:
- Time domain: $\mathcal{T} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^+$
- System structure: $\mathcal{S}$ (topology, components)
- Failure model: $\mathcal{F}$ (distributions, dependencies)

The [[reliability operator]] $\mathcal{R}$ maps system configurations to reliability functions:
$$\mathcal{R}: \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{F} \to [0,1]^{\mathcal{T}}$$

The [[structural operator]] $\Phi$ maps component states to system states:
$$\Phi: \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}$$

The [[aging operator]] $\mathcal{A}$ captures temporal degradation:
$$\mathcal{A}_t: \mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{F}$$

## Quality Assurance and Standards

### Reliability Standards

**IEC 61508**: Functional safety standards

**ISO 26262**: Automotive functional safety

**DO-178C**: Software considerations in airborne systems

**IEEE 1413**: Software reliability measurement

### Reliability Metrics

**Mean Time to Failure**: $\text{MTTF} = \int_0^{\infty} R(t) dt$

**Mean Time Between Failures**: $\text{MTBF} = \text{MTTF} + \text{MTTR}$

**Availability**: $A = \frac{\text{MTTF}}{\text{MTTF} + \text{MTTR}}$

**Mission Reliability**: $R(t_m)$ where $t_m$ is mission time

## Economic Aspects

### Life Cycle Cost Analysis

**Total Cost**: $C_{\text{total}} = C_{\text{design}} + C_{\text{manufacturing}} + C_{\text{operation}} + C_{\text{disposal}}$

**Reliability-Cost Optimization**:
$$\min E[\text{LCC}] = C_{\text{initial}} + \int_0^T E[C_{\text{maintenance}}(t)] dt + C_{\text{failure}} \cdot F(T)$$

### Value of Reliability Improvement

### Fractional Reliability

Using [[fractional calculus]] for memory effects:
$$^C D_0^{\alpha} R(t) = -h^{(\alpha)}(t) R(t)$$

where $^C D_0^{\alpha}$ is the [[Caputo fractional derivative]].

### Reliability on Manifolds

For systems on non-Euclidean spaces:
$$\nabla_M R + h(x) R = 0$$

where $\nabla_M$ is the [[Riemannian gradient]] on manifold $M$.

## Future Directions
