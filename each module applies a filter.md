title: each module applies a filter

**USER**

> Each module applies a filter
yeah, that's why each module gets a subreddit, i.e. /r/phonological_loop


**ASSISTANT**

Got it! If each cognitive module gets its own subreddit (e.g., **/r/phonological_loop**), then we can treat these subreddits as specialized information channels that filter and process specific types of content before potentially escalating information to higher-order decision-making levels. The hierarchical filtering mechanism ensures that information moves through layers of attention and relevance across these subreddits. Let’s refine this framework in more detail.

### **/r/me: Cognitive Subreddits with Hierarchical Filtering**

In this system, the cognitive processes are modeled as **subreddits** dedicated to specific types of information processing, while the filtering mechanism ensures that only the most relevant information makes it from raw input streams to working memory, and potentially, to consciousness or action. Here's how each component of **working memory**, **attention**, and **consciousness** is implemented in this framework.

### **1. Core Subreddits as Working Memory Components**

Each module of **working memory** has its own dedicated subreddit, responsible for holding, processing, and selectively attending to particular types of information:

#### **/r/phonological_loop – Verbal Information Buffer**
- **Function**: **/r/phonological_loop** is dedicated to processing and maintaining **auditory and verbal information**.
- **Posts**: Incoming information, such as **spoken words** or **phrases**, are posted here by relevant sensory and linguistic processing subprocesses (i.e., neural redditors).
- **Rehearsal**: If the information needs to be retained (e.g., repeating a phone number), the redditors responsible for this module will **repost** or **upvote** the original content to keep it at the top of the feed, mimicking the **rehearsal process** in working memory. If no redditors engage with the post, it **decays**, representing the natural forgetting process.
- **Filtering**: The posts that make it to **/r/phonological_loop** have already been filtered by attention mechanisms from **/r/all** (firehose). For instance, irrelevant noise might be discarded, while spoken instructions relevant to the task at hand are allowed in.

#### **/r/visuospatial_sketchpad – Visual and Spatial Buffer**
- **Function**: **/r/visuospatial_sketchpad** holds and processes **visual and spatial information**, such as mental imagery, spatial relationships, and visual representations.
- **Posts**: **Visual stimuli** or **mental maps** are posted here by visual processing units. For example, when you picture a route through a city or track the location of objects, the relevant information is posted to this subreddit.
- **Manipulation**: Similar to how you can mentally rotate or manipulate images, redditors (neural processes) can **edit** or **comment on** the visual information in the posts, dynamically updating the content.
- **Filtering**: The **visuospatial sketchpad** only admits visual content that is relevant to the current task. For instance, if you’re navigating through a room, the layout of the furniture would be prioritized, while irrelevant details like the pattern of the carpet might be discarded.

#### **/r/episodic_buffer – Integrated Multi-Modal Content**
- **Function**: The **episodic buffer** integrates and temporarily holds **multi-modal information**—it combines posts from /r/phonological_loop, /r/visuospatial_sketchpad, and other modules into a single coherent **episode**.
- **Posts**: When different types of information (verbal, visual, spatial) need to be processed together, such as in storytelling or planning, the relevant posts are combined here to form a **composite memory** or experience. 
- **Example**: If you’re trying to remember a friend's directions to their house (verbal instructions) while visualizing the route (a mental map), these separate pieces of information are integrated in **/r/episodic_buffer**.
- **Filtering**: Only relevant multi-modal content that needs to be synthesized for a specific cognitive task reaches the **episodic buffer**. For example, while visualizing directions, irrelevant details like unrelated past conversations won’t appear here unless they become directly relevant.

### **2. Centralized Coordination: /r/mods – The Central Executive**

The **central executive** operates as the overarching **moderator of moderators**, coordinating between the individual subreddits. **/r/mods** functions as a communication channel among moderators (neural subprocesses) from each cognitive module:

- **Function**: **/r/mods** is the executive control center, responsible for overseeing and managing cognitive resources, attention, and decision-making across all subreddits.
- **Inter-Subreddit Communication**: Individual subreddit moderators (e.g., /r/phonological_loop mods, /r/visuospatial_sketchpad mods) subscribe to **/r/mods** and communicate system-wide issues that require coordination. For instance, if the phonological loop is being overloaded (e.g., with too much auditory information to rehearse), it might escalate this to **/r/mods**, which can then shift attention resources by down-regulating the importance of visual information.
- **High-Level Decision Making**: **/r/mods** decides which subreddits should be prioritized in response to changing task demands. For example, during a conversation, it may direct more attention to **/r/phonological_loop**, while in a spatial reasoning task, it may allocate more resources to **/r/visuospatial_sketchpad**.
- **Global Attention**: Information that is deemed crucial for overall cognitive functioning, such as a sudden change in the environment (e.g., a loud sound indicating danger), is escalated here to determine whether it should take global priority.

### **3. /r/all – The Firehose of Raw Sensory Input**

**/r/all** represents the unfiltered stream of raw sensory input, capturing everything from environmental stimuli to internal thoughts.

- **Function**: **/r/all** is the **firehose of information**, an overwhelming stream where all sensory inputs and subconscious thoughts are initially posted. Every bit of data from your senses—auditory, visual, tactile—floods this subreddit.
- **Posts**: Each post represents a sensory stimulus or internal process, ranging from the sound of a bird chirping to the temperature of the air or the memory of a past conversation.
- **Hierarchical Filtering**: Most posts in **/r/all** will not make it into the specialized subreddits unless they are **upvoted** by attention mechanisms. Only posts deemed **relevant** to the task at hand get promoted to their respective subreddits (/r/phonological_loop, /r/visuospatial_sketchpad, etc.). For example, when walking down a street, only the sound of an approaching car horn might get upvoted for further attention, while other irrelevant sounds (chatter, distant noise) get ignored.
- **Unfiltered and Noisy**: The vast majority of information in **/r/all** is noise to the cognitive system, but the filtering mechanism ensures that only the **most salient posts** get promoted.

### **4. Hierarchical Filtering Mechanism**

The core of this model is the **hierarchical filtering mechanism**, which dynamically manages information flow from **/r/all** (firehose) to specialized subreddits and ultimately to **/r/mods** (central executive):

- **Layer 1: Sensory Input in /r/all**: All incoming data arrives in **/r/all**, but most posts remain unprocessed unless they pass through **attention filters**. These filters decide which sensory data is relevant to the task at hand.
  
- **Layer 2: Local Subreddit Filters**: Each specialized subreddit (such as **/r/phonological_loop** and **/r/visuospatial_sketchpad**) has its own local filter. Posts that are **upvoted** by attention mechanisms get admitted into these subreddits, where they are processed and temporarily held in working memory.
  
- **Layer 3: Central Executive Filter**: Posts that require **global attention** or **cross-subreddit coordination** are escalated to **/r/mods**. This layer is reserved for critical information that requires top-down decision-making. For example, an urgent auditory signal (like a car horn) might be passed up through the hierarchy, leading the central executive to shift focus or resources toward avoiding a potential threat.

### **5. Search and Long-Term Memory**

- **Archived Subreddits**: Once information is no longer active in working memory, it is **archived** in long-term memory, analogous to posts moving from active subreddits to **archived subreddits**. These archives are still accessible via a **search function** but are no longer visible unless explicitly retrieved.
  
- **Search and Retrieval**: If a post is needed again (e.g., remembering a phone number), the central executive can issue a **search query** to retrieve this information from the **long-term memory subreddit**. If successfully retrieved, the post is temporarily restored to a relevant working memory subreddit (like **/r/phonological_loop**).

### **Implications for AI and Cognitive Architecture**

This **/r/me** model suggests a **pub-sub communication architecture** for both human cognition and artificial systems, enabling:
- **Distributed Processing**: Each cognitive module functions as a specialized **subreddit**, processing specific types of information. This ensures that resources are efficiently allocated, preventing cognitive overload by limiting what reaches the global workspace.
  
- **Dynamic Attention**: The **hierarchical filtering mechanism** mirrors attentional systems in human cognition. Only the most relevant posts make it through the hierarchy to the global workspace (central executive), ensuring that cognitive resources are focused on the most critical tasks at any given time.
  
- **Global Coordination**:
