Langlands, R. (1967). "Automorphic Forms on GL(2)."


**ASSISTANT**

The paper *Automorphic Forms on GL(2)* by Robert P. Langlands, written in 1967, is a seminal work that laid the foundation for what is now known as the **Langlands Program**—a vast, conjectural web of relationships between number theory, representation theory, and algebraic geometry. This work is particularly concerned with **automorphic forms** and their connections to representations of **general linear groups** over local and global fields.

Here’s a structured overview of the key concepts and contributions from the 1967 paper:

### 1. **Automorphic Forms on GL(2)**:
Automorphic forms are complex-valued functions that exhibit a certain level of symmetry with respect to the action of a group, typically defined on some quotient space. In the context of Langlands' work, the group in question is the general linear group $GL(2)$, i.e., the group of invertible $2 \times 2$ matrices.

- Let $GL(2)$ denote the group of invertible $2 \times 2$ matrices over a [[number field]] $F$.
- The **global** aspect refers to the study of these forms over the adeles (i.e., the restricted product of local fields), giving a connection to global fields, such as number fields.
- The **local** aspect involves understanding the representations of $GL(2)$ over the local fields, which are completions of $F$ (e.g., $\mathbb{Q}_p$ in the case of $F = \mathbb{Q}$).

Automorphic forms generalize classical modular forms but are defined on more general spaces and for broader classes of groups.

### 2. **Representation Theory**:
The paper introduces the idea that the space of automorphic forms on $GL(2)$ can be understood through **representation theory**. Automorphic forms can be associated with certain **irreducible representations** of $GL(2, \mathbb{A}_F)$, where $\mathbb{A}_F$ is the adele ring of a [[number field]] $F$. The work formalizes this relationship in terms of **cuspidal representations**, which are a subset of automorphic forms exhibiting a specific vanishing property on certain subspaces.

This connection between automorphic forms and representations leads to:

- **L-functions**: Langlands associates automorphic forms on $GL(2)$ with certain types of **L-functions**, generalizing the classical Dirichlet L-functions and the L-functions attached to modular forms.
  
### 3. **Langlands Correspondence**:
One of the most profound contributions of this paper is the initial formulation of the **Langlands correspondence**, which conjecturally links automorphic representations of $GL(n)$ (starting with $GL(2)$ in this case) to **Galois representations**. Specifically:

- **Automorphic representations**: These are infinite-dimensional representations of $GL(2, \mathbb{A}_F)$ that can be realized in the space of square-integrable automorphic forms.
- **Galois representations**: These are continuous homomorphisms from the absolute Galois group $G_F = \text{Gal}(\overline{F}/F)$ of a [[number field]] $F$ into a matrix group, such as $GL(n, \mathbb{C})$.

The **Langlands correspondence** proposes a one-to-one matching between automorphic representations of $GL(2)$ and two-dimensional Galois representations of the absolute Galois group $G_F$. This correspondence generalizes and includes classical results such as **Artin reciprocity** (a major part of class field theory) and aims to explain the deeper connections between number theory and representation theory.

### 4. **Eisenstein Series and Cuspidal Representations**:
Langlands also delves into the study of **Eisenstein series**, which are particular automorphic forms that play a key role in understanding the spectral decomposition of the space of automorphic forms on $GL(2)$.

- **Cuspidal automorphic forms** are those automorphic forms that vanish on the unipotent radical of a parabolic subgroup. These forms give rise to cuspidal representations of $GL(2)$, which are central to the Langlands correspondence.
- **Eisenstein series**, on the other hand, correspond to non-cuspidal representations and arise from parabolic induction from representations of subgroups.

### 5. **Adelic Formulation**:
Langlands formulated the theory in the adelic setting, meaning that automorphic forms are viewed as functions on the group $GL(2, \mathbb{A}_F)$, where $\mathbb{A}_F$ is the ring of adeles of a [[number field]] $F$. The adelic framework allows one to treat the global and local components of the theory in a unified manner.

### 6. **L-functions and Functoriality**:
Langlands relates automorphic forms to **L-functions**, which generalize the Riemann zeta function and Dirichlet L-functions. His conjectures include the **principle of functoriality**, which posits that there should be a transfer of automorphic forms (and thus L-functions) between different groups in a way that reflects underlying relationships between their representations.

For $GL(2)$, the L-functions are closely related to those defined by classical modular forms, and Langlands' work establishes a correspondence between these L-functions and automorphic representations of $GL(2)$.

### Summary of Key Contributions:
1. **Automorphic forms on $GL(2)$**: The framework for studying automorphic forms on the group of 2x2 matrices over global and local fields.
2. **Langlands correspondence**: The conjectural relationship between automorphic representations of $GL(2)$ and Galois representations of degree 2.
3. **L-functions**: Langlands shows how automorphic representations are associated with L-functions, generalizing the classical modular forms' L-functions.
4. **Eisenstein series and cuspidal representations**: A decomposition of automorphic forms into cuspidal and Eisenstein series, forming the spectral theory for $GL(2)$.
5. **Adelic formulation**: The use of the adele ring $\mathbb{A}_F$ to provide a coherent framework for automorphic forms on $GL(2)$, connecting local and global perspectives.

Langlands' 1967 work on **GL(2)** is the seed from which the vast **Langlands Program** has grown, with far-reaching implications in modern mathematics, especially in fields such as number theory, algebraic geometry, and the representation theory of Lie groups. The core idea of **reciprocity** between Galois representations and automorphic forms continues to drive much of the research in this area today.
