### Condorcet Criterion

The Condorcet criterion is a concept in [[social choice theory]] used to evaluate the fairness and effectiveness of voting systems. Named after the 18th-century French philosopher and mathematician Marquis de Condorcet, the criterion states that a voting system should always select the Condorcet winner if one exists. The Condorcet winner is a candidate who would win a head-to-head competition against each of the other candidates.

### Key Concepts

1. **Condorcet Winner**: A candidate who, when compared in a one-on-one contest with every other candidate, is preferred by a majority of voters.
2. **Pairwise Comparison**: A method of comparing candidates by evaluating their performance in individual head-to-head contests.
3. **Condorcet Paradox**: A situation where no Condorcet winner exists because the preferences of voters create a cycle (e.g., A beats B, B beats C, but C beats A).

### Example

Consider an election with three candidates: A, B, and C, and the following voter preferences:

- 40% of voters prefer A > B > C
- 35% of voters prefer B > C > A
- 25% of voters prefer C > A > B

**Pairwise Comparisons**:

- **A vs. B**:
  - 40% prefer A over B
  - 25% prefer C over A, so implicitly A over B
  - Total: 65% prefer A over B, 35% prefer B over A
- **A vs. C**:
  - 40% prefer A over C
  - 35% prefer B over C, so implicitly C over A
  - Total: 40% prefer A over C, 60% prefer C over A
- **B vs. C**:
  - 35% prefer B over C
  - 40% prefer A over B, so implicitly B over C
  - Total: 75% prefer B over C, 25% prefer C over B

**Result**: Candidate B is the Condorcet winner because B wins in pairwise contests against both A and C.

### Voting Systems and the Condorcet Criterion

Not all voting systems satisfy the Condorcet criterion. Here are some common voting systems and their relationship with the Condorcet criterion:

#### Voting Systems that Satisfy the Condorcet Criterion

1. **Condorcet Method**: Directly based on the criterion, this method uses pairwise comparisons to find the Condorcet winner. Various implementations include the Schulze method and Ranked Pairs.

2. **Minimax**: Also known as the Simpson-Kramer method, this system finds the candidate whose worst pairwise defeat is better than the worst defeat of any other candidate.

#### Voting Systems that Do Not Satisfy the Condorcet Criterion

1. **Plurality Voting**: Voters select one candidate, and the candidate with the most votes wins. This system does not guarantee that the Condorcet winner will be selected.
   
   **Example**: If voters in the previous example voted solely for their top choice, A might win with 40% of the votes, despite B being the Condorcet winner.

2. **Runoff Voting**: If no candidate wins a majority, a runoff is held between the top candidates. This system can fail to elect the Condorcet winner.

   **Example**: In a two-round system, if A and C advance to the runoff, C could win despite B being the Condorcet winner.

3. **Ranked Choice Voting (Instant Runoff Voting)**: Voters rank candidates, and the candidate with the fewest first-choice votes is eliminated, with votes transferred until a majority is achieved. This system can also fail to select the Condorcet winner.

   **Example**: In the previous example, C might be eliminated first, leading to a final runoff between A and B, potentially missing B as the Condorcet winner depending on the vote transfers.

### Condorcet Paradox

The Condorcet paradox occurs when there is no Condorcet winner due to cyclic preferences among candidates. For example, if voters have preferences:

- 1/3 prefer A > B > C
- 1/3 prefer B > C > A
- 1/3 prefer C > A > B

The pairwise comparisons yield:

- A beats B (2/3 prefer A over B)
- B beats C (2/3 prefer B over C)
- C beats A (2/3 prefer C over A)

This creates a cycle with no clear Condorcet winner.

### Applications and Implications

1. **Election Design**: Understanding the Condorcet criterion helps in designing fair and representative electoral systems. Systems satisfying the criterion ensure that the most broadly supported candidate wins.
   
2. **Fairness and Voter Satisfaction**: Condorcet-compliant systems generally result in outcomes that better reflect collective preferences, reducing the likelihood of dissatisfaction among voters.

3. **Strategic Voting**: The Condorcet criterion can reduce the impact of strategic voting, where voters may otherwise manipulate their preferences to influence the outcome.

### Conclusion

The Condorcet criterion is a valuable standard for evaluating the fairness and effectiveness of voting systems. While not all systems satisfy this criterion, those that do, like the Condorcet method and Minimax, provide a robust way to ensure that the most broadly supported candidate is elected. Understanding and applying the Condorcet criterion is crucial for designing electoral systems that reflect true voter preferences and enhance democratic decision-making.
