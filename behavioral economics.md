**ASSISTANT**

**Behavioral Economics** is a subfield of economics that integrates insights from psychology and other social sciences to understand how individuals make economic decisions. Unlike traditional economic theories, which assume that individuals are fully rational and always act in their best interest, behavioral economics recognizes that people often exhibit biases, make irrational choices, and are influenced by cognitive, emotional, and social factors.

### Key Concepts in Behavioral Economics

1. **Bounded Rationality**:
   - Individuals have limited cognitive resources, information, and time, which constrains their ability to make fully rational decisions. People use heuristics or rules of thumb to make decisions, which can lead to systematic biases.

2. **Heuristics and Biases**:
   - **Heuristics** are mental shortcuts that simplify decision-making. Common heuristics include availability, representativeness, and anchoring.
   - **Biases** are systematic deviations from rationality. Examples include confirmation bias, overconfidence, and loss aversion.

3. **Prospect Theory**:
   - Developed by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, prospect theory describes how people make choices under uncertainty. It challenges the expected utility theory by showing that people value gains and losses differently, leading to loss aversion and an emphasis on potential gains and losses relative to a reference point.

4. **Loss Aversion**:
   - The tendency to prefer avoiding losses over acquiring equivalent gains. For example, the pain of losing $100 is generally felt more intensely than the pleasure of gaining $100.

5. **Time Inconsistency**:
   - Individuals often have inconsistent preferences over time, leading to behaviors like procrastination and under-saving for retirement. Present bias and hyperbolic discounting are examples where people disproportionately weigh immediate rewards over future benefits.

6. **Social Preferences**:
   - People care about fairness, reciprocity, and altruism. They are willing to sacrifice their own well-being to punish unfair behavior or to help others.

7. **Nudges**:
   - Small changes in the [[choice architecture]] that can significantly influence behavior without restricting freedom of choice. Popularized by Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein, nudges include default options, framing effects, and the arrangement of choices.

### Applications of Behavioral Economics

1. **Public Policy**:
   - Behavioral economics informs policies that aim to improve social welfare by leveraging insights into human behavior. Examples include automatic enrollment in retirement savings plans, default options for organ donation, and sin taxes on unhealthy behaviors.

2. **Finance**:
   - Understanding investor behavior, such as overconfidence, herd behavior, and loss aversion, helps in designing better financial products and regulations. Behavioral finance studies how psychological factors affect financial markets.

3. **Marketing**:
   - Companies use behavioral insights to influence consumer behavior through pricing strategies, product placements, and advertising techniques that appeal to cognitive biases.

4. **Health**:
   - Behavioral economics can improve health outcomes by designing interventions that promote healthy behaviors, such as reminders for medication adherence, incentives for healthy living, and framing health messages effectively.

5. **Education**:
   - Enhancing educational outcomes by understanding how students make decisions about studying, attending classes, and engaging in learning activities. Interventions include providing timely feedback, setting achievable goals, and using peer influence positively.

### Key Figures in Behavioral Economics

1. **Daniel Kahneman**:
   - A pioneer in the field, Kahneman won the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for his work on prospect theory and behavioral economics. His book "Thinking, Fast and Slow" is a seminal text that outlines many concepts in the field.

2. **Amos Tversky**:
   - Collaborated with Kahneman on prospect theory and contributed significantly to the understanding of heuristics and biases.

3. **Richard Thaler**:
   - A leading figure in behavioral economics, Thaler's work on [[nudge theory]] and behavioral finance earned him the Nobel Prize. His book "Nudge" (co-authored with Cass Sunstein) explores how small changes can influence behavior in meaningful ways.

4. **Cass Sunstein**:
   - A legal scholar who has co-authored influential works on nudges and behavioral law and economics, contributing to the application of behavioral insights in public policy.

### Challenges and Criticisms

1. **Predictability**:
   - While behavioral economics identifies patterns and biases, predicting individual behavior with precision remains challenging due to the complexity and variability of human psychology.

2. **Ethical Concerns**:
   - The use of nudges raises ethical questions about manipulation and autonomy. Critics argue that nudges may infringe on individual freedom of choice and consent.

3. **Integration with Traditional Economics**:
   - Integrating behavioral insights with traditional economic models requires reconciling differences in assumptions about rationality and decision-making processes.

### Conclusion

Behavioral Economics provides a richer understanding of economic decision-making by incorporating psychological insights into traditional economic theories. It addresses the limitations of the rational actor model and offers practical applications in policy-making, finance, marketing, health, and education. By recognizing the cognitive, emotional, and social influences on behavior, behavioral economics helps design interventions that improve individual and societal outcomes. For further exploration, consider related topics on [[Prospect Theory|prospect theory]], [[Nudge Theory|[[nudge theory]]]], and [[Behavioral Finance|behavioral finance]].

**Behavioral Economics** is a field that combines insights from psychology, economics, and other social sciences to understand how people make economic decisions. It challenges the traditional economic assumption of rationality, emphasizing that individuals often act in ways that deviate from purely rational behavior due to cognitive biases, emotions, and social influences.

### Key Concepts in Behavioral Economics

1. **Bounded Rationality**:
   - The concept that individuals have limited cognitive resources, information, and time, which constrain their ability to make fully rational decisions. People often use heuristics or mental shortcuts to make decisions, leading to systematic biases.

2. **Heuristics and Biases**:
   - **Heuristics**: Simplified decision-making rules or mental shortcuts. Examples include the availability heuristic (relying on immediate examples that come to mind) and the representativeness heuristic (judging the probability of an event based on how much it resembles a typical case).
   - **Biases**: Systematic deviations from rationality. Common biases include:
     - **Anchoring Bias**: Relying heavily on the first piece of information encountered (the "anchor") when making decisions.
     - **Confirmation Bias**: Favoring information that confirms pre-existing beliefs and ignoring contradictory evidence.
     - **Overconfidence Bias**: Overestimating one's own abilities, knowledge, or predictions.

3. **Prospect Theory**:
   - Developed by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, prospect theory describes how people make choices under uncertainty. It introduces concepts such as loss aversion (the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over acquiring equivalent gains) and the value function, which is concave for gains and convex for losses, indicating that people are risk-averse for gains and risk-seeking for losses.

4. **Loss Aversion**:
   - The tendency to prefer avoiding losses over acquiring equivalent gains. For example, the pain of losing $100 is typically felt more intensely than the pleasure of gaining $100.

5. **Time Inconsistency**:
   - The tendency for individuals to have inconsistent preferences over time. This can lead to behaviors like procrastination and under-saving for retirement, as people disproportionately value immediate rewards over future benefits. Hyperbolic discounting is a model that describes this behavior.

6. **Social Preferences**:
   - People care about fairness, reciprocity, and altruism. They are willing to sacrifice their own well-being to punish unfair behavior or to help others. This contrasts with the traditional economic assumption that individuals act solely out of self-interest.

7. **Nudges**:
   - Small changes in the [[choice architecture]] that significantly influence behavior without restricting freedom of choice. Popularized by Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein, nudges include default options, framing effects, and the strategic arrangement of choices to promote better decision-making.

### Applications of Behavioral Economics

1. **Public Policy**:
   - Behavioral economics informs policies designed to improve social welfare by leveraging insights into human behavior. Examples include automatic enrollment in retirement savings plans, default options for organ donation, and sin taxes on unhealthy behaviors.

2. **Finance**:

**USER**

behavioral economics


**ASSISTANT**

Behavioral economics is a field that combines insights from psychology with economic theory to explore how actual human behavior deviates from the rational agent model that is standard in classical economics. It seeks to understand why people make irrational financial decisions and how their behavior does not always align with their long-term goals. This field has gained prominence since the late 20th century, largely due to the work of psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, who introduced concepts such as cognitive biases and heuristics that affect decision-making.

### Key Concepts in Behavioral Economics:

1. **Heuristics**:
   - Mental shortcuts that ease the cognitive load of making decisions. For example, the "availability heuristic" leads people to overestimate the importance of information that is readily available to them.

2. **Cognitive Biases**:
   - Systematic patterns of deviation from norm or rational judgment. These include confirmation bias, where individuals focus more on information that confirms their preconceptions, and loss aversion, where the fear of losing is more psychologically impactful than the joy of gaining.

3. **Prospect Theory**:
   - Developed by Kahneman and Tversky, it describes how people value potential losses and gains differently, leading to decision-making that does not align with traditional economic rationality. This theory suggests that people are more likely to engage in risk-averse behavior when evaluating potential gains and risk-seeking behavior when evaluating potential losses.

4. **Framing Effects**:
   - The way choices are presented can significantly affect how a decision is made, even if the economic outcomes are identical. For example, individuals might react differently to a 95% survival rate than to a 5% mortality rate, even though both convey the same information.

5. **Time Inconsistency**:
   - Refers to the tendency of people to value immediate rewards more highly than future rewards, leading to procrastination or choices that favor immediate gratification over long-term benefits.

6. **Nudge Theory**:
   - Introduced by Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein, it involves subtly guiding choices without restricting freedom of choice. A "nudge" might include rearranging the layout of food in a cafeteria to promote healthier choices or setting default options in retirement plans to encourage better long-term saving behavior.

### Applications of Behavioral Economics:

- **Public Policy**: Governments use behavioral economics to design policies that help people make better choices. For example, automatic enrollment in pension plans increases saving for retirement without removing the individual's choice to opt-out.
  
- **Healthcare**: Behavioral economics strategies are used to nudge individuals towards healthier behaviors, such as using smaller plates to reduce portion sizes or sending reminders for vaccination appointments.

- **Marketing**: Companies apply behavioral economics to influence consumer purchasing decisions. This might include pricing strategies, product placement, and the physical or digital environment designed to maximize sales.

- **Financial Sector**: Understanding the irrational behaviors that lead to bubbles and crashes in financial markets can help in designing better financial products and in regulating markets more effectively.

### Ethical Considerations:

While behavioral economics can lead to outcomes that increase welfare or profits, it also raises ethical questions concerning manipulation and autonomy. The ethical use of behavioral economics requires careful consideration to ensure that nudges and other interventions respect the decision-maker's values and freedom of choice.

Behavioral economics has revolutionized the understanding of economic decision-making by incorporating psychological realism into the models. It offers tools to help improve decision-making in individual, corporate, and policy contexts, emphasizing the practical implications of psychological insights on economic activity. For further exploration, related topics might include [[Prospect Theory]], [[Nudge Theory]], and the implications of behavioral economics in various sectors like finance and public health.

I should provide mathematical formulations throughout, following the user's preferences for technical depth and symbolic notation. I'll include concrete examples and applications while maintaining the academic rigor expected for this knowledge base.# Behavioral Economics

## Definition

**Behavioral Economics** is an [[interdisciplinary field]] that integrates [[psychological insights]] into [[economic modeling]] to understand how [[cognitive biases]], [[emotions]], [[social factors]], and [[bounded rationality]] systematically deviate from the predictions of [[traditional economic theory]]. This field develops [[mathematical frameworks]] that incorporate [[psychological realism]] into [[decision-making models]], providing more accurate descriptions of [[human economic behavior]] while maintaining [[analytical rigor]] and [[predictive power]].

## Mathematical Foundations

### Departure from Expected Utility

Traditional [[Expected Utility Theory]] assumes:
$$U(\mathcal{L}) = \sum_{i} p_i u(x_i)$$

where $\mathcal{L}$ is a [[lottery]], $p_i$ are probabilities, and $u(x_i)$ are utilities of outcomes.

Behavioral economics relaxes key assumptions:
1. **Rationality:** Agents may use [[heuristics]] instead of optimization
2. **Consistency:** Preferences may be [[context-dependent]]
3. **Self-interest:** Agents may have [[social preferences]]
4. **Perfect information processing:** Agents exhibit [[cognitive limitations]]

### Behavioral Utility Functions

A generalized [[behavioral utility function]] takes the form:
$$U_B(x, c, s, t) = f(u(x), \mathcal{C}(c), \mathcal{S}(s), \mathcal{T}(t))$$

where:
- $u(x)$ is the [[standard utility]] from outcome $x$
- $\mathcal{C}(c)$ captures [[cognitive factors]] and [[context]] $c$
- $\mathcal{S}(s)$ represents [[social influences]] and [[reference groups]] $s$
- $\mathcal{T}(t)$ models [[temporal factors]] and [[dynamic effects]] $t$

### Reference-Dependent Preferences

[[Reference-dependent utility]] modifies standard utility:
$$U(x) = u(x - r) + \eta \cdot v(x - r)$$

where:
- $r$ is the [[reference point]]
- $u(\cdot)$ is [[consumption utility]]
- $v(\cdot)$ is [[gain-loss utility]]
- $\eta$ is the [[loss aversion coefficient]]

## Prospect Theory

### Value Function

[[Prospect Theory]] replaces utility with a [[value function]] $v(\cdot)$ defined over gains and losses:

$$v(x) = \begin{cases}
x^{\alpha} & \text{if } x \geq 0 \\
-\lambda(-x)^{\beta} & \text{if } x < 0
\end{cases}$$

where:
- $\alpha, \beta \in (0,1)$ create [[diminishing sensitivity]]
- $\lambda > 1$ represents [[loss aversion]]
- The reference point determines gains vs. losses

### Probability Weighting

[[Decision weights]] $w(p)$ replace objective probabilities:

$$w(p) = \frac{p^{\gamma}}{(p^{\gamma} + (1-p)^{\gamma})^{1/\gamma}}$$

This creates:
- **Overweighting** of small probabilities: $w(p) > p$ for small $p$
- **Underweighting** of large probabilities: $w(p) < p$ for large $p$
- **Subcertainty:** $w(p) + w(1-p) < 1$

### Cumulative Prospect Theory

For a prospect with outcomes $x_1 < x_2 < \cdots < x_n$ and probabilities $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$:

$$V = \sum_{i=1}^n \pi_i v(x_i)$$

where [[decision weights]] are:
$$\pi_i = w\left(\sum_{j=i}^n p_j\right) - w\left(\sum_{j=i+1}^n p_j\right)$$

### Four-Fold Pattern

Prospect theory predicts distinct behavior across probability-outcome combinations:

| | Gains | Losses |
|---|-------|---------|
| **High Probability** | Risk Averse | Risk Seeking |
| **Low Probability** | Risk Seeking | Risk Averse |

This explains phenomena like [[insurance purchases]] (risk averse for low-probability losses) and [[lottery playing]] (risk seeking for low-probability gains).

## Temporal Decision Making

### Hyperbolic Discounting

Traditional [[exponential discounting]]:
$$U(t) = \delta^t u(x)$$

[[Hyperbolic discounting]] model:
$$U(t) = \frac{1}{1 + kt} u(x)$$

### Quasi-Hyperbolic Model

The [[beta-delta model]] captures [[present bias]]:
$$U_t = u_t + \beta \sum_{s=t+1}^T \delta^{s-t} u_s$$

where:
- $\delta \in (0,1)$ is the [[long-term discount factor]]
- $\beta \in (0,1)$ creates [[present bias]]
- When $\beta < 1$, immediate rewards are overvalued

### Dynamic Inconsistency

At time $t$, preferences over consumption at times $s > t$ are:
$$C_s^* = \arg\max_{C_s} \beta \delta^{s-t} u(C_s)$$

At time $s$, preferences become:
$$C_s^{**} = \arg\max_{C_s} u(C_s)$$

The inconsistency $C_s^* \neq C_s^{**}$ leads to [[self-control problems]].

### Intertemporal Choice Models

**Attribute-based models** decompose intertemporal choice:
$$V(x, t) = \alpha \cdot v_{\text{amount}}(x) + \beta \cdot v_{\text{delay}}(t) + \gamma \cdot v_{\text{interaction}}(x,t)$$

**Hyperbolic-exponential mixture:**
$$U(x, t) = \pi \cdot \frac{u(x)}{1 + kt} + (1-\pi) \cdot \delta^t u(x)$$

combining both discounting types.

## Social Preferences

### Inequality Aversion

[[Fehr-Schmidt model]] of inequality aversion:
$$U_i(x) = x_i - \alpha_i \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{j \neq i} \max(x_j - x_i, 0) - \beta_i \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{j \neq i} \max(x_i - x_j, 0)$$

where:
- $\alpha_i$ measures [[envy]] (disutility from others' higher payoffs)
- $\beta_i$ measures [[guilt]] (disutility from others' lower payoffs)
- Typically $\alpha_i \geq \beta_i \geq 0$

### Reciprocity Models

[[Rabin's reciprocity model]] incorporates [[intentions]]:
$$U_i(a_i, a_j) = \pi_i(a_i, a_j) + f_i(b_j) \cdot \pi_j(a_i, a_j)$$

where:
- $\pi_i$ is agent $i$'s [[material payoff]]
- $f_i(b_j)$ is $i$'s [[kindness]] toward $j$ based on $j$'s [[perceived intentions]] $b_j$
- $\pi_j$ is agent $j$'s material payoff

### Altruism and Warm Glow

**Pure altruism:**
$$U_i = u_i(x_i) + \alpha_i u_j(x_j)$$

**Warm glow giving:**
$$U_i = u_i(x_i - g_i) + \phi_i(g_i)$$

where $g_i$ is the gift amount and $\phi_i$ represents [[warm glow utility]].

### Social Welfare Functions

[[Charness-Rabin model]] generalizes social preferences:
$$U_i = (1-\lambda_i) \pi_i + \lambda_i [\delta_i \min_j \pi_j + (1-\delta_i) \sum_j \pi_j]$$

combining [[self-interest]], [[maximin preferences]], and [[utilitarian preferences]].

## Mental Accounting

### Multiple Mental Accounts

Agents partition wealth into separate [[mental accounts]] $\{A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n\}$ with account-specific utility:
$$U = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i u_i(A_i)$$

where $w_i$ are [[account weights]] and $u_i$ are [[account-specific utility functions]].

### Hedonic Editing

[[Thaler's hedonic editing principles]]:
1. **Segregate gains:** $v(x) + v(y) > v(x+y)$ for gains
2. **Integrate losses:** $v(-(x+y)) > v(-x) + v(-y)$ for losses  
3. **Cancel losses against larger gains:** $v(x-y) > v(x) + v(-y)$ when $x > y > 0$
4. **Segregate small gains from larger losses:** $v(-x) + v(y) > v(y-x)$ when $x > y > 0$

### Transaction Utility

Total utility includes both [[acquisition utility]] and [[transaction utility]]:
$$U_{\text{total}} = U_{\text{acquisition}} + U_{\text{transaction}}$$

where:
$$U_{\text{transaction}} = v(\text{reference price} - \text{actual price})$$

### Fungibility Violations

Mental accounting creates [[violations of fungibility]]:
$$\frac{\partial C}{\partial W_i} \neq \frac{\partial C}{\partial W_j}$$

where $C$ is consumption and $W_i, W_j$ are different wealth sources.

## Framing Effects

### Preference Reversals

[[Description invariance]] is violated when logically equivalent frames yield different choices.

**Asian Disease Problem framing:**
- **Gain frame:** "200 lives saved" vs. "1/3 probability 600 saved"
- **Loss frame:** "400 lives lost" vs. "1/3 probability 0 lost"

Despite logical equivalence, choices reverse between frames.

### Attribute Framing

The [[framing function]] $\phi(\cdot)$ maps objective attributes to subjective perceptions:
$$v_{\text{perceived}}(x) = v(\phi(x, \text{frame}))$$

**Examples:**
- "90% lean" vs. "10% fat"
- "Glass half full" vs. "Glass half empty"

### Decision Frame Dependence

The [[choice set]] affects preferences through [[contrast effects]]:
$$U(x | S) = u(x) + \gamma \cdot \text{contrast}(x, S)$$

where $S$ is the choice set and $\text{contrast}(\cdot)$ captures relative standing.

### Reference Point Adjustment

Reference points adjust based on [[framing cues]]:
$$r_{\text{frame}} = r_{\text{default}} + \alpha \cdot \text{frame adjustment}$$

## Heuristics and Biases

### Representativeness Heuristic

[[Base rate neglect]] occurs when judgments rely primarily on representativeness:
$$P(H|E) \approx \frac{\text{similarity}(E, H)}{\sum_i \text{similarity}(E, H_i)}$$

ignoring prior probabilities $P(H)$.

### Availability Heuristic

[[Probability judgments]] based on memory accessibility:
$$\hat{P}(E) = f(\text{availability}(E))$$

where availability depends on:
- **Recency:** Recent events more available
- **Vividness:** Dramatic events more memorable  
- **Personal experience:** Direct experience increases availability

### Anchoring and Adjustment

Initial values serve as [[anchors]] for subsequent judgments:
$$J = A + \epsilon (T - A)$$

where:
- $J$ is the final judgment
- $A$ is the anchor
- $T$ is the true value
- $\epsilon \in (0,1)$ represents [[insufficient adjustment]]

### Confirmation Bias

Information search favoring confirming evidence:
$$P(\text{search confirming} | \text{prior belief}) > P(\text{search disconfirming} | \text{prior belief})$$

## Cognitive Load and Dual-Process Theory

### System 1 vs. System 2

**System 1 (Automatic):**
- Fast, effortless, intuitive
- Relies on heuristics and emotions
- Prone to biases

**System 2 (Controlled):**
- Slow, effortful, deliberative  
- Uses logical reasoning
- More accurate but resource-intensive

### Cognitive Load Effects

Under high [[cognitive load]] $L$:
$$P(\text{System 1}) = \frac{e^{\alpha}}{e^{\alpha} + e^{\beta/L}}$$

Higher load increases reliance on System 1 processing.

### Depletion Models

[[Ego depletion]] affects subsequent decision quality:
$$Q_{t+1} = Q_t - \delta \cdot \text{effort}_t + \text{recovery}(\text{rest}_t)$$

where decision quality deteriorates with mental effort.

## Game Theory Applications

### Behavioral Game Theory

Traditional Nash equilibrium:
$$s_i^* \in \arg\max_{s_i} u_i(s_i, s_{-i}^*)$$

[[Behavioral equilibrium]] incorporates bounded rationality:
$$s_i^* \in \arg\max_{s_i} U_i^B(s_i, s_{-i}^*, \text{context})$$

### Quantal Response Equilibrium

Players choose strategies probabilistically based on expected payoffs:
$$\sigma_i(s_i) = \frac{e^{\lambda u_i(s_i, \sigma_{-i})}}{\sum_{s_i'} e^{\lambda u_i(s_i', \sigma_{-i})}}$$

where $\lambda$ measures [[rationality level]].

### Social Preference Games

In [[public goods games]] with inequality aversion:
$$\max_{g_i} U_i = x_i - g_i + \alpha \sum_j g_j - \beta \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{j \neq i} |g_j - g_i|$$

### Learning in Games

[[Reinforcement learning]] in repeated games:
$$q_{i,t+1}(s) = q_{i,t}(s) + \alpha [\pi_i(s, s_{-i,t}) - q_{i,t}(s)] \cdot \mathbf{1}[s_{i,t} = s]$$

where $q_{i,t}(s)$ is the [[Q-value]] for strategy $s$ at time $t$.

## Neuroeconomics Integration

### Neural Value Representation

Brain regions encode [[subjective value]]:
$$\text{BOLD}_{\text{vmPFC}} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot SV + \beta_2 \cdot \text{context} + \epsilon$$

where $SV$ is subjective value and vmPFC is ventromedial prefrontal cortex.

### Dual-System Neural Implementation

**System 1:** Limbic system, automatic responses
$$V_{\text{limbic}} = \alpha \cdot \text{reward} + \beta \cdot \text{emotion}$$

**System 2:** Prefrontal cortex, controlled processing  
$$V_{\text{PFC}} = \gamma \cdot \text{expected value} + \delta \cdot \text{long-term goals}$$

### Neurotransmitter Effects

[[Dopamine]] affects risk preferences:
$$\text{Risk preference} = \alpha + \beta \cdot [\text{DA}] + \gamma \cdot \text{task variables}$$

[[Serotonin]] influences temporal discounting:
$$\text{Discount rate} = \delta_0 \cdot e^{-\kappa [\text{5-HT}]}$$

## Computational Models

### Prospect Theory Implementation

### Hyperbolic Discounting Model

```python
class HyperbolicAgent:
    def __init__(self, beta=0.7, delta=0.95):
        self.beta = beta  # Present bias
        self.delta = delta  # Long-term discount factor

                      for other in others_payoffs) / (n - 1)
    
    return own_payoff - envy - guilt
```

## Empirical Methods

### Laboratory Experiments

**Controlled environment** testing of behavioral theories:

```python
def ultimatum_game_experiment(n_subjects, endowment=10):
    """
    Ultimatum game testing fairness preferences
    """
    results = []
    
    for subject in range(n_subjects):
        # Proposer decision
        offer = elicit_offer(subject, endowment)
        
        # Responder decision  
        accept = elicit_acceptance(subject, offer, endowment)
        
        # Payoffs
        if accept:
            payoffs = (endowment - offer, offer)
        else:
            payoffs = (0, 0)
            
        results.append({
            'offer': offer,
            'accept': accept,
            'payoffs': payoffs
        })
    
    return analyze_results(results)
```

### Field Experiments

**Natural settings** testing behavioral interventions:
- [[Randomized controlled trials]] in real markets
- [[Natural experiments]] exploiting policy changes
- [[Quasi-experimental designs]] using variation in treatment

### Neuroimaging Studies

**fMRI experimental design:**
$$\text{BOLD}_{i,t} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{Decision Variable}_{i,t} + \mathbf{X}_{i,t}\boldsymbol{\beta} + \epsilon_{i,t}$$

**EEG analysis:**
Event-related potentials (ERPs) measuring:
- **P300:** Attention and value assessment
- **FRN:** Feedback processing and learning
- **ERN:** Error monitoring and conflict

### Behavioral Measurement

**Choice-based measures:**
- [[Revealed preferences]] from decisions
- [[Incentive-compatible mechanisms]]
- [[Multiple price lists]] for risk/time preferences

**Process measures:**
- [[Eye tracking]] attention patterns
- [[Mouse tracking]] deliberation dynamics
- [[Response times]] for decision difficulty

## Applications

### Finance and Investment

**Behavioral asset pricing** incorporating psychological factors:
$$R_{t+1} = \alpha + \beta \cdot \text{Market}_{t+1} + \gamma \cdot \text{Sentiment}_t + \epsilon_{t+1}$$

**Portfolio choice** with mental accounting:
$$\max_{\{w_i\}} \sum_i \theta_i V_i(w_i R_i)$$

where $\theta_i$ are [[account-specific weights]].

**Retirement savings** with present bias:
$$\max_{c_t, s_t} u(c_t) + \beta \sum_{s=t+1}^T \delta^{s-t} u(c_s)$$

subject to budget constraints and retirement needs.

### Marketing and Consumer Behavior

**Price framing effects:**
- [[Partitioned pricing]]: "$19.99 + $5 shipping" vs. "$24.99"
- [[Anchor pricing]]: High anchor increases willingness to pay
- [[Decoy effects]]: Inferior options make target more attractive

**Mental accounting applications:**
- [[Payment depreciation]]: Prepayment reduces pain of payment
- [[Expense categorization]]: Budget categories affect spending
- [[Windfall effects]]: Unexpected income spent differently

### Health Economics

**Health behavior change** using behavioral insights:
$$\text{Health Investment}_t = f(\text{present bias}, \text{self-control}, \text{social norms})$$

**Insurance decisions** with probability weighting:
- Overinsurance for low-probability, high-loss events
- Underinsurance for high-probability, low-loss events

**Medical adherence** considering present bias:
$$\text{Adherence} = \beta \delta \cdot \text{Future Health Benefits} - \text{Current Costs}$$

### Public Policy and Nudging

**Nudge framework** preserving choice while guiding behavior:
$$\text{Nudge Effectiveness} = f(\text{choice architecture}, \text{default options}, \text{salience})$$

**Default effects** in policy design:
- [[Automatic enrollment]] in retirement plans
- [[Opt-out]] vs. [[opt-in]] organ donation
- [[Default investment]] allocations

**Tax policy** incorporating behavioral responses:
$$\text{Tax Revenue} = \tau \cdot \text{Income} \cdot (1 - \text{Avoidance}(\tau, \text{salience}))$$

### Labor Economics

**Effort provision** with reference dependence:
$$\text{Effort} = f(\text{wage} - \text{reference wage}, \text{fairness perceptions})$$

**Job search** with present bias:
$$\text{Search Intensity} = \beta \delta \cdot \text{Future Wage Gains} - \text{Current Search Costs}$$

**Compensation design** using behavioral insights:
- [[Loss framing]] for performance incentives
- [[Social comparisons]] in pay structures
- [[Non-monetary rewards]] leveraging intrinsic motivation

## Welfare Analysis

### Behavioral Welfare Economics

Traditional welfare measures may be inappropriate with behavioral agents. Alternative approaches:

**Multiple selves framework:**
$$W = \sum_t \omega_t U_t$$

where $\omega_t$ are [[normative weights]] on different temporal selves.

**Revealed vs. Stated preferences:**
$$W_{\text{behavioral}} = \alpha W_{\text{revealed}} + (1-\alpha) W_{\text{stated}}$$

**Experience utility vs. Decision utility:**
- [[Decision utility]]: What people choose
- [[Experience utility]]: What people actually experience
- [[Remembered utility]]: What people recall experiencing

### Policy Evaluation

**Libertarian paternalism** framework:
$$W = \text{Individual Choice Freedom} + \text{Outcome Improvement}$$

**Nudge evaluation criteria:**
1. **Effectiveness:** Does it change behavior?
2. **Welfare improvement:** Does it make people better off?
3. **Autonomy preservation:** Does it maintain choice?

### Happiness and Well-being

**Subjective well-being** measures:
$$\text{SWB} = \alpha \cdot \text{Life Satisfaction} + \beta \cdot \text{Positive Affect} - \gamma \cdot \text{Negative Affect}$$

**Adaptation effects:**
$$\text{Happiness}_t = \alpha \cdot \text{Income}_t + \beta \cdot (\text{Income}_t - \text{Adaptation Level}_{t-1})$$

## Methodological Issues

### External Validity

**Lab-to-field generalizability:**
- [[Stakes effects]]: Do lab findings hold with real money?
- [[Context effects]]: Do artificial settings matter?
- [[Selection effects]]: Are lab subjects representative?

**Cross-cultural validity:**
- Cultural variation in behavioral biases
- Different social norms and preferences
- Economic development effects

### Internal Validity

**Demand effects:** Subjects responding to perceived experimenter expectations

**Experimenter effects:** Researcher characteristics affecting results

**Order effects:** Sequence of tasks influencing responses

### Statistical Considerations

**Multiple testing:** Corrections needed for multiple hypothesis testing
$$\alpha_{\text{corrected}} = \frac{\alpha_{\text{family-wise}}}{k}$$

**Publication bias:** Tendency to publish significant results only

**Replication crisis:** Many behavioral findings fail to replicate

## Computational Behavioral Economics

### Agent-Based Modeling

**Behavioral agents** in economic simulations:
```python
class BehavioralAgent:
    def __init__(self, loss_aversion=2.25, present_bias=0.7):
        self.loss_aversion = loss_aversion
        self.present_bias = present_bias
        self.reference_point = 0
        
    def make_decision(self, options, context):
        """Decision making with behavioral factors"""
        values = []
        for option in options:
            # Prospect theory value
            value = self.prospect_value(option)
            
            # Context effects
            value += self.context_adjustment(option, context)
            
            values.append(value)
        
        # Stochastic choice with errors
        return self.stochastic_choice(values)
```

### Machine Learning Applications

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
import numpy as np

class BehavioralPredictor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = RandomForestRegressor()
        
    def create_features(self, decisions, contexts):
        """Extract behavioral features"""
        features = []
        
        for decision, context in zip(decisions, contexts):
            # Standard economic variables
            economic_vars = [decision['payoff'], decision['probability']]
            
            # Behavioral variables
            behavioral_vars = [
                self.loss_indicator(decision),
                self.framing_effect(context),
                self.social_context(context),
                self.cognitive_load(context)
            ]
            
            features.append(economic_vars + behavioral_vars)
        
        return np.array(features)
```

### Neural Networks for Behavioral Modeling

import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class BehavioralChoiceNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, hidden_dim=64):
        super().__init__()
        
        # Separate pathways for System 1 and System 2
        self.system1_net = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(input_dim, hidden_dim),
            nn.Tanh(),  # Fast, heuristic processing
            nn.Linear(hidden_dim, 1)
        )
        
        self.system2_net = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(input_dim, hidden_dim),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Dropout(0.1),  # Effortful, can be depleted
            nn.Linear(hidden_dim, hidden_dim),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(hidden_dim, 1)
        )
        
        # Cognitive load determines system weighting
        self.load_gate = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(input_dim, 1),
            nn.Sigmoid()
        )
    
    def forward(self, x, cognitive_load):
        system1_output = self.system1_net(x)
        system2_output = self.system2_net(x)
        
        # Higher cognitive load increases System 1 reliance
        load_weight = self.load_gate(cognitive_load)
        
        return load_weight * system1_output + (1 - load_weight) * system2_output
```
