extensions of the central limit theorem in stochastic processes theory


**ASSISTANT**

The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a fundamental result in probability theory, ensuring that the sum (or average) of a large number of independent random variables, suitably normalized, converges in distribution to a normal distribution. In the theory of stochastic processes, the CLT has several important extensions to dependent data, random fields, functionals of stochastic processes, and other complex structures. Here, we explore some key extensions of the CLT in stochastic processes theory.

### 1. **CLT for Markov Chains**

#### Statement
Let \(\{X_n\}_{n \geq 0}\) be an ergodic Markov chain with stationary distribution \(\pi\). Consider a function \(f\) with \(E_\pi[f(X)] = 0\) and \(E_\pi[f(X)^2] < \infty\). The partial sums of \(f(X_n)\) satisfy a CLT:
$$ \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \sum_{k=1}^n f(X_k) \xrightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2), $$
where \(\sigma^2 = \lim_{n \to \infty} \text{Var}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \sum_{k=1}^n f(X_k)\right)\).

#### Proof Sketch
The proof typically involves:
- **Martingale Approximation**: Decompose the sum into a [[martingale difference sequence]] plus a remainder term.
- **Mixing Conditions**: Use mixing properties of the Markov chain to control the dependence.
- **Application of Martingale CLT**: Apply the [[martingale central limit theorem]] to establish the result.

### 2. **CLT for Mixing Sequences**

#### Statement
Let \(\{X_n\}\) be a strongly mixing sequence with mixing coefficients \(\alpha(n)\) satisfying \(\sum_{n=1}^\infty \alpha(n) < \infty\). Suppose \(E[X_i] = 0\) and \(E[X_i^2] < \infty\). Then,
$$ \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i \xrightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2), $$
where \(\sigma^2 = \lim_{n \to \infty} \text{Var}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i\right)\).

#### Proof Sketch
The proof involves:
- **Controlling Dependence**: Using the strong mixing condition to show that the dependence between distant terms is weak.
- **Blocking Technique**: Dividing the sequence into blocks and using independence between blocks asymptotically.
- **Application of Lindeberg-Feller CLT**: Adapting the classical Lindeberg-Feller central limit theorem for weakly dependent sequences.

### 3. **Functional Central Limit Theorem (FCLT)**

#### Statement
Let \(\{X_n\}\) be a sequence of random variables. Define the partial sum process \(S_n(t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \sum_{i=1}^{\lfloor nt \rfloor} X_i\) for \(t \in [0,1]\). Under suitable conditions (e.g., independence or weak dependence),
$$ S_n(t) \xrightarrow{d} W(t), $$
where \(W(t)\) is a standard Brownian motion.

#### Proof Sketch
The proof typically involves:
- **Tightness**: Showing that the sequence of processes \(\{S_n(t)\}\) is tight in the Skorokhod space \(D[0,1]\).
- **Finite-Dimensional Convergence**: Demonstrating that finite-dimensional distributions converge to those of the Brownian motion.
- **Application of Functional Limit Theorem**: Using tools from [[empirical process theory]] and functional analysis.

### 4. **CLT for Martingales**

#### Statement
Let \(\{M_n\}\) be a martingale with differences \(d_i = M_i - M_{i-1}\) and \(E[d_i^2 \mid \mathcal{F}_{i-1}] = \sigma_i^2\). If \( \sum_{i=1}^n \sigma_i^2 \to \sigma^2 \) and \( \max_{1 \leq i \leq n} \sigma_i^2 \to 0 \) as \( n \to \infty \), then:
$$ \frac{M_n}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n \sigma_i^2}} \xrightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}(0,1). $$

#### Proof Sketch
The proof involves:
- **Lindeberg Condition**: Verifying a martingale version of the Lindeberg condition.
- **Martingale Difference CLT**: Applying a central limit theorem specifically for martingale differences.

### 5. **CLT for Random Fields**

#### Statement
Let \(\{X_t\}\) be a random field indexed by \(t \in \mathbb{Z}^d\). Under appropriate mixing conditions and moment conditions, the normalized sum of \(X_t\) over a growing region \(A_n\) satisfies:
$$ \frac{1}{\sqrt{|A_n|}} \sum_{t \in A_n} X_t \xrightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2), $$
where \(|A_n|\) is the volume of the region \(A_n\).

#### Proof Sketch
The proof involves:
- **Spatial Dependence Control**: Using mixing conditions to handle dependencies across the random field.
- **Multidimensional Blocking Technique**: Extending the blocking technique to higher dimensions.
- **Application of CLT for Mixing Sequences**: Generalizing CLT results for mixing sequences to random fields.

### 6. **CLT for Point Processes**

#### Statement
Let \(\{N(t)\}\) be a point process with intensity function \(\lambda(t)\). For suitable functionals \(f\) of the point process, the normalized sum satisfies:
$$ \frac{1}{\sqrt{T}} \sum_{i=1}^{N(T)} f(X_i) \xrightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2), $$
where \(\sigma^2\) depends on the second-order properties of the process.

#### Proof Sketch
The proof involves:
- **Compensator Approach**: Using the compensator of the point process to handle variability.
- **Martingale Methods**: Applying martingale central limit theorems for the compensator.

### Applications

1. **Queueing Theory**:
   In queueing models, the CLT provides insights into the distribution of waiting times, queue lengths, and other performance metrics.

2. **Time Series Analysis**:
   The CLT is used to derive the asymptotic distribution of estimators, such as the sample mean, autocovariances, and other statistics.

3. **Econometrics**:
   The CLT underpins the asymptotic theory for estimators in econometric models, facilitating hypothesis testing and confidence interval construction.

4. **Machine Learning**:
   In algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent, the CLT helps understand the asymptotic behavior of the learned parameters.

5. **Spatial Statistics**:
   The CLT for random fields is used in analyzing spatial data, providing distributional results for estimators of spatial parameters.
