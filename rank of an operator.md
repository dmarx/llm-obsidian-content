## Rank of an Operator

The rank of an operator is a fundamental concept in linear algebra and functional analysis, describing the dimension of the image of the operator. It is closely related to the concepts of nullity, the dimension of the kernel, and the overall structure of linear operators.

### Definition

For a linear operator \( T: \mathcal{H} \to \mathcal{H} \) on a Hilbert space \( \mathcal{H} \), the **rank** of \( T \), denoted as \( \mathrm{rank}(T) \), is defined as the dimension of the image (or range) of \( T \):

$$
\mathrm{rank}(T) = \dim(\mathrm{Im}(T))
$$

where \( \mathrm{Im}(T) = \{T x : x \in \mathcal{H}\} \) is the set of all possible outputs of \( T \).

### Properties

1. **Finite-Dimensional Case**:
   - If \( \mathcal{H} \) is a finite-dimensional vector space, say \( \mathbb{R}^n \) or \( \mathbb{C}^n \), then \( T \) can be represented by an \( n \times n \) matrix.
   - The rank of \( T \) is the number of linearly independent columns (or rows) of the matrix representing \( T \).

2. **Infinite-Dimensional Case**:
   - In an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, the rank can still be finite or infinite.
   - If the rank is finite, the operator is called a **finite-rank operator**.
   - If the rank is infinite but countable, the operator's rank can be described as countably infinite.

3. **Rank-Nullity Theorem**:
   - For a finite-dimensional vector space \( \mathbb{R}^n \) or \( \mathbb{C}^n \), the rank-nullity theorem states:
     $$
     \mathrm{rank}(T) + \mathrm{nullity}(T) = n
     $$
   - Here, \( \mathrm{nullity}(T) \) is the dimension of the kernel (null space) of \( T \), \( \mathrm{Ker}(T) = \{x \in \mathcal{H} : T x = 0\} \).

### Examples

1. **Finite Rank Operator**:
   - Consider the operator \( T: \mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R}^3 \) defined by the matrix:
     $$
     T = \begin{pmatrix}
     1 & 2 & 3 \\
     0 & 1 & 4 \\
     0 & 0 & 0
     \end{pmatrix}
     $$
   - The rank of \( T \) is 2, as there are two linearly independent rows (or columns).

2. **Projection Operator**:
   - Let \( P: \mathcal{H} \to \mathcal{H} \) be a projection operator defined by \( P x = \langle x, e \rangle e \) for some unit vector \( e \in \mathcal{H} \).
   - The rank of \( P \) is 1, since it maps any vector to a scalar multiple of \( e \).

3. **Zero Operator**:
   - The zero operator \( 0: \mathcal{H} \to \mathcal{H} \) defined by \( 0x = 0 \) for all \( x \in \mathcal{H} \) has rank 0, as its image is just the zero vector.

4. **Identity Operator**:
   - The identity operator \( I: \mathcal{H} \to \mathcal{H} \) defined by \( I x = x \) for all \( x \in \mathcal{H} \) has rank equal to the dimension of \( \mathcal{H} \). If \( \mathcal{H} \) is infinite-dimensional, the rank is infinite.

### Applications

1. **Solving Linear Systems**:
   - The rank of the coefficient matrix in a system of linear equations determines the number of independent equations and the dimensionality of the solution space.
   
2. **Dimensionality Reduction**:
   - In data analysis and machine learning, low-rank approximations of matrices are used in techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of data while retaining significant features.

3. **Quantum Mechanics**:
   - In quantum mechanics, the rank of an operator can determine the number of states that a system can occupy. For example, projection operators onto eigenspaces of a Hamiltonian have ranks equal to the degeneracies of the corresponding eigenvalues.
