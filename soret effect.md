Soret effect


**ASSISTANT**

The **Soret effect**, also known as **thermal diffusion**, refers to the phenomenon where a temperature gradient in a multicomponent fluid causes species to migrate. In other words, it describes how temperature differences lead to the separation of different types of molecules or particles within a mixture. This effect is most commonly observed in gases and liquids but can also occur in other phases.

### Formal Definition of the Soret Effect

The **Soret effect** is the mass diffusion of species driven by a temperature gradient, where heavier or larger molecules tend to move toward colder regions, while lighter or smaller molecules tend to move toward hotter regions. This phenomenon is described by an additional term in the species diffusion equation that accounts for the thermal gradient.

Mathematically, the total diffusion flux $\mathbf{J}_i$ of species $i$ in the presence of both concentration and temperature gradients is given by:
$$
\mathbf{J}_i = - D_i \nabla c_i - D_{T,i} \frac{\nabla T}{T}
$$
where:
- $\mathbf{J}_i$ is the diffusion flux of species $i$ (mass per area per time),
- $D_i$ is the **mass diffusivity** of species $i$ (describing ordinary diffusion due to concentration gradients),
- $D_{T,i}$ is the **thermal diffusion coefficient** (or Soret coefficient) for species $i$,
- $\nabla c_i$ is the concentration gradient of species $i$,
- $\nabla T$ is the temperature gradient,
- $T$ is the local temperature.

The term $-D_{T,i} \frac{\nabla T}{T}$ represents the **thermal diffusion flux**, which drives species $i$ in the presence of a temperature gradient.

### Soret Effect in Combustion

In the context of **combustion**, the Soret effect can influence the distribution of chemical species, especially in systems with steep temperature gradients, such as flame fronts or high-temperature reactors. Though the Soret effect is generally less significant than ordinary diffusion, it can play a noticeable role under certain conditions, particularly in:
- **Hydrogen combustion**: Due to hydrogen's low molecular weight, the Soret effect becomes more pronounced, leading to significant migration of hydrogen atoms in the direction of the temperature gradient.
- **Non-premixed flames**: Where temperature gradients between fuel and oxidizer streams are steep, the Soret effect can alter the local concentration of fuel and oxidizer near the flame front.

### Key Properties of the Soret Effect

1. **Soret Coefficient ($S_T$)**:
   The **Soret coefficient** (or thermal diffusion ratio) quantifies the strength of the thermal diffusion effect for a particular species. It is defined as:
   $$
   S_T = \frac{D_T}{D}
   $$
   where $D_T$ is the thermal diffusion coefficient, and $D$ is the mass diffusion coefficient. A positive $S_T$ indicates that the species moves toward colder regions, while a negative $S_T$ indicates that the species moves toward hotter regions.

2. **Light vs. Heavy Molecules**:
   The Soret effect generally causes **lighter molecules** (e.g., hydrogen) to migrate toward the hotter region, while **heavier molecules** (e.g., hydrocarbons) migrate toward the colder region. This can lead to concentration gradients that are superimposed on the temperature gradients.

3. **Timescales**:
   The Soret effect typically acts on slower timescales compared to ordinary diffusion or chemical reactions. As a result, its influence may only become significant over long time periods or in systems with strong and persistent temperature gradients.

### Examples of the Soret Effect

1. **Hydrogen Flames**:
   In combustion involving hydrogen, the Soret effect can cause hydrogen molecules to migrate toward the hotter regions of the flame, modifying the local equivalence ratio and influencing the flame structure and propagation speed.

2. **Industrial Chemical Processes**:
   In processes involving high-temperature reactors, the Soret effect can alter the distribution of reactants and products, especially in gas-phase reactions with large temperature gradients.

3. **Geophysics**:
   In the Earth's mantle, the Soret effect can contribute to the separation of different chemical species under the influence of temperature gradients over geological timescales.

### Experimental Observation and Relevance

The Soret effect is more pronounced in **low-density gases** and **dilute mixtures** where the difference in molecular mass between components is significant. Experimental measurements of the Soret effect can be made using specialized setups that impose controlled temperature gradients on gas or liquid mixtures and then observe the resulting concentration gradients using spectroscopic or chromatographic methods.

In combustion systems, the Soret effect can influence flame behavior, particularly in:
- **Microgravity combustion**: Where natural convection is absent, and diffusion dominates transport processes.
- **Turbulent combustion**: Where small-scale temperature gradients can interact with species transport in complex ways.

### Mathematical Formulation of the Soret Effect in Combustion Models

In the context of flame models, the species conservation equation must be modified to include thermal diffusion terms when the Soret effect is considered. The modified species conservation equation for a single species $i$ can be written as:
$$
\frac{\partial (\rho Y_i)}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{v} Y_i) = - \nabla \cdot \mathbf{J}_i + \dot{\omega}_i
$$
where:
- $\rho$ is the fluid density,
- $Y_i$ is the mass fraction of species $i$,
- $\mathbf{v}$ is the fluid velocity,
- $\mathbf{J}_i$ is the diffusion flux including the Soret effect,
- $\dot{\omega}_i$ is the rate of production or consumption of species $i$ due to chemical reactions.

Including the thermal diffusion flux in $\mathbf{J}_i$ accounts for the Soret effect in numerical simulations of combustion, especially in systems with multi-component gas mixtures where significant temperature gradients exist.

### Summary of the Soret Effect

- The **Soret effect** describes the movement of chemical species in response to temperature gradients, leading to a redistribution of species in a non-isothermal environment.
- It is most significant in systems with steep temperature gradients or in mixtures of light and heavy molecules.
- In **combustion**, the Soret effect can influence [[flame speed]], structure, and stability, particularly in systems involving hydrogen or other light molecules.
- Mathematically, the Soret effect introduces an additional diffusion flux term in the species conservation equation, modifying the standard Fickian diffusion law to account for temperature gradients.

While often secondary to ordinary diffusion, the Soret effect plays a role in detailed modeling of combustion and chemical processes where temperature gradients and species separation are important.
