Separation of Variables


**ASSISTANT**

**Separation of Variables** is a powerful method for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). It involves breaking down a complex PDE into simpler, ordinary differential equations (ODEs) by assuming that the solution can be written as a product of functions, each depending on a single coordinate. Here's a detailed explanation of the method, focusing on the context of Laplace's equation in spherical coordinates.

### Separation of Variables: An Overview

To solve a PDE using the method of separation of variables, follow these steps:

1. **Assume a Separable Solution**:
   Assume that the solution can be written as a product of functions, each depending on a single coordinate.

2. **Substitute the Assumed Solution**:
   Substitute the assumed product solution into the original PDE.

3. **Separate the Equation**:
   Rearrange the equation so that each term depends on only one coordinate. This usually involves dividing by the product solution to isolate each term.

4. **Equate to a Constant**:
   Since each term depends on a different coordinate, the only way the equation can hold for all values of the coordinates is if each term is equal to a constant.

5. **Solve the Resulting ODEs**:
   Solve the resulting ordinary differential equations (ODEs) independently.

6. **Combine Solutions**:
   Combine the solutions of the ODEs to form the general solution of the original PDE.

### Application to Laplace's Equation in Spherical Coordinates

Let's apply this method to Laplace's equation in spherical coordinates. The equation is:

\[ \nabla^2 f = 0. \]

In spherical coordinates \((r, \theta, \phi)\), the Laplacian operator $\nabla^2$ is:

\[ \nabla^2 f = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left( r^2 \frac{\partial f}{\partial r} \right) + \frac{1}{r^2 \sin \theta} \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \left( \sin \theta \frac{\partial f}{\partial \theta} \right) + \frac{1}{r^2 \sin^2 \theta} \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial \phi^2}. \]

We seek a solution of the form:

\[ f(r, \theta, \phi) = R(r) \Theta(\theta) \Phi(\phi). \]

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Substitute the Assumed Solution**:

   Substitute \( f(r, \theta, \phi) = R(r) \Theta(\theta) \Phi(\phi) \) into Laplace's equation:

   \[ \frac{1}{R(r) \Theta(\theta) \Phi(\phi)} \left[ \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 \frac{dR}{dr} \right) R(r) + \frac{1}{r^2 \sin \theta} \frac{d}{d\theta} \left( \sin \theta \frac{d\Theta}{d\theta} \right) \Theta(\theta) + \frac{1}{r^2 \sin^2 \theta} \frac{d^2 \Phi}{d\phi^2} \Phi(\phi) \right] = 0. \]

2. **Separate the Equation**:

   Multiply through by \( r^2 \sin^2 \theta \) to separate variables:

   \[ \frac{\sin^2 \theta}{R(r)} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 \frac{dR}{dr} \right) + \frac{\sin \theta}{\Theta(\theta)} \frac{d}{d\theta} \left( \sin \theta \frac{d\Theta}{d\theta} \right) + \frac{1}{\Phi(\phi)} \frac{d^2 \Phi}{d\phi^2} = 0. \]

   Rearrange terms:

   \[ \frac{1}{R(r)} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 \frac{dR}{dr} \right) + \frac{1}{\Theta(\theta) \sin \theta} \frac{d}{d\theta} \left( \sin \theta \frac{d\Theta}{d\theta} \right) + \frac{1}{\Phi(\phi) \sin^2 \theta} \frac{d^2 \Phi}{d\phi^2} = 0. \]

3. **Equate to Constants**:

   Since each term depends on a different variable, each term must be equal to a constant. Let:

   \[ \frac{1}{\Phi(\phi)} \frac{d^2 \Phi}{d\phi^2} = -m^2, \]

   \[ \frac{1}{\Theta(\theta) \sin \theta} \frac{d}{d\theta} \left( \sin \theta \frac{d\Theta}{d\theta} \right) + \frac{m^2}{\sin^2 \theta} = -l(l+1), \]

   \[ \frac{1}{R(r)} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 \frac{dR}{dr} \right) = l(l+1). \]

### Solving the ODEs

4. **Solve for \(\Phi(\phi)\)**:

   \[ \frac{d^2 \Phi}{d\phi^2} + m^2 \Phi = 0. \]

   The solution is:

   \[ \Phi(\phi) = A e^{im\phi} + B e^{-im\phi}. \]

   For periodic boundary conditions (single-valuedness), \( m \) must be an integer.

5. **Solve for \(\Theta(\theta)\)**:

   \[ \frac{d}{d\theta} \left( \sin \theta \frac{d\Theta}{d\theta} \right) + \left[ l(l+1) \sin \theta - \frac{m^2}{\sin \theta} \right] \Theta = 0. \]

   This is the associated Legendre differential equation. The solutions are the associated Legendre functions \( P_l^m(\cos \theta) \).

6. **Solve for \(R(r)\)**:

   \[ r^2 \frac{d^2 R}{dr^2} + 2r \frac{dR}{dr} - l(l+1)R = 0. \]

   The general solution is:

   \[ R(r) = C r^l + D r^{-(l+1)}. \]

### General Solution

The general solution to Laplace's equation in spherical coordinates is:

\[ f(r, \theta, \phi) = \sum_{l=0}^\infty \sum_{m=-l}^l \left( A_{lm} r^l + B_{lm} r^{-(l+1)} \right) Y_{lm}(\theta, \phi), \]

where the spherical harmonics \( Y_{lm}(\theta, \phi) \) are given by:

\[ Y_{lm}(\theta, \phi) = \sqrt{\frac{(2l+1)(l-m)!}{4\pi (l+m)!}} P_l^m(\cos \theta) e^{im\phi}. \]

### Summary

The method of separation of variables is a powerful technique for solving partial differential equations. By assuming a separable form of the solution and systematically separating and solving the resulting ordinary differential equations, we can solve

### Separation of Variables

Separation of variables is a powerful mathematical technique used to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) by transforming them into simpler, ordinary differential equations (ODEs). This method is particularly useful when dealing with PDEs in coordinate systems that lend themselves to separability, such as Cartesian, cylindrical, or spherical coordinates.

### General Procedure

To illustrate the separation of variables technique, consider a PDE of the form:
$$ \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \nabla^2 u, $$
where $u = u(x, t)$ is a function of space $x$ and time $t$, and $c$ is a constant.

### Steps for Separation of Variables

1. **Assume a Separable Solution**:
   Assume that the solution $u(x, t)$ can be written as a product of functions, each depending only on one of the variables:
   $$ u(x, t) = X(x)T(t). $$

2. **Substitute into the PDE**:
   Substitute the assumed form of the solution into the original PDE:
   $$ \frac{\partial^2 (X(x)T(t))}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \nabla^2 (X(x)T(t)). $$

3. **Separate Variables**:
   This yields:
   $$ X(x) \frac{d^2 T(t)}{d t^2} = c^2 T(t) \nabla^2 X(x). $$
   Divide both sides by $X(x)T(t)$ to separate the variables:
   $$ \frac{1}{T(t)} \frac{d^2 T(t)}{d t^2} = c^2 \frac{1}{X(x)} \nabla^2 X(x). $$

4. **Set Equal to a Constant**:
   Since the left side depends only on $t$ and the right side depends only on $x$, they must be equal to a constant. Let this constant be $-\lambda$:
   $$ \frac{1}{T(t)} \frac{d^2 T(t)}{d t^2} = -\lambda = c^2 \frac{1}{X(x)} \nabla^2 X(x). $$

5. **Formulate ODEs**:
   This results in two separate ODEs:
   $$ \frac{d^2 T(t)}{d t^2} + \lambda T(t) = 0, $$
   $$ \nabla^2 X(x) + \frac{\lambda}{c^2} X(x) = 0. $$

6. **Solve the ODEs**:
   Each ODE can be solved independently.

### Example: Heat Equation in One Dimension

Consider the heat equation in one spatial dimension:
$$ \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \alpha \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}, $$
where $\alpha$ is the thermal diffusivity constant.

1. **Assume a Separable Solution**:
   $$ u(x, t) = X(x)T(t). $$

2. **Substitute into the PDE**:
   $$ X(x) \frac{d T(t)}{d t} = \alpha T(t) \frac{d^2 X(x)}{d x^2}. $$

3. **Separate Variables**:
   $$ \frac{1}{\alpha T(t)} \frac{d T(t)}{d t} = \frac{1}{X(x)} \frac{d^2 X(x)}{d x^2} = -\lambda. $$

4. **Formulate ODEs**:
   $$ \frac{d T(t)}{d t} = -\alpha \lambda T(t), $$
   $$ \frac{d^2 X(x)}{d x^2} + \lambda X(x) = 0. $$

5. **Solve the ODEs**:
   - For $T(t)$:
     $$ T(t) = T_0 e^{-\alpha \lambda t}. $$
   - For $X(x)$:
     $$ X(x) = A \cos(\sqrt{\lambda} x) + B \sin(\sqrt{\lambda} x). $$

### Boundary and Initial Conditions

The general solution to the PDE will often involve applying boundary and initial conditions to determine the specific form of the solution.

### Application to Spherical Coordinates

Consider Laplace's equation in spherical coordinates:
$$ \nabla^2 f = 0. $$

In spherical coordinates \((r, \theta, \phi)\), this becomes:
$$ \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left( r^2 \frac{\partial f}{\partial r} \right) + \frac{1}{r^2 \sin \theta} \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \left( \sin \theta \frac{\partial f}{\partial \theta} \right) + \frac{1}{r^2 \sin^2 \theta} \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial \phi^2} = 0. $$

Assume a separable solution:
$$ f(r, \theta, \phi) = R(r) \Theta(\theta) \Phi(\phi). $$

Substituting into the PDE and separating variables yields:
$$ \frac{1}{R} \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{d r} \left( r^2 \frac{d R}{d r} \right) + \frac{1}{\Theta \sin \theta} \frac{d}{d \theta} \left( \sin \theta \frac{d \Theta}{d \theta} \right) + \frac{1}{\Phi \sin^2 \theta} \frac{d^2 \Phi}{d \phi^2} = 0. $$

Multiplying by $r^2$ and separating variables results in three ODEs:
$$ \frac{1}{R} \frac{d}{d r} \left( r^2 \frac{d R}{d r} \right) = -l(l+1), $$
$$ \frac{1}{\Theta \sin \theta} \frac{d}{d \theta} \left( \sin \theta \frac{d \Theta}{d \theta} \right) - \frac{m^2}{\sin^2 \theta} = l(l+1), $$
$$ \frac{1}{\Phi} \frac{d^2 \Phi}{d \phi^2} = -m^2. $$

Solving these ODEs leads to solutions in terms of spherical harmonics and radial functions.

### Summary

Separation of variables transforms a complex PDE into simpler ODEs, allowing for straightforward solutions under appropriate boundary and initial conditions. This technique is essential in many fields, including physics, engineering, and applied mathematics.
