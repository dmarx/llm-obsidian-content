### Conclusion

**Vehicle-Borne Improvised Explosive Devices (VBIEDs)** are among the most dangerous and destructive forms of IEDs. Their ability to carry large explosive payloads and target specific locations makes them a favorite weapon of terrorists and insurgents. Identifying and neutralizing VBIEDs requires expertise in recognizing suspicious behaviors, vehicle modifications, and deploying technological aids for detection. Implementing effective countermeasures, such as perimeter defenses and standoff distances, along with swift and effective responses from EOD teams, can significantly reduce the threat posed by VBIEDs.

insurgency IED strategies and tactics


**ASSISTANT**

**Insurgency IED strategies and tactics** refer to the methods and approaches used by insurgent groups to deploy **Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs)** as part of an asymmetrical warfare strategy. Insurgents often use IEDs to counter technologically superior forces, such as regular military units, through cost-effective and easily accessible means. IEDs provide insurgents with flexibility, mobility, and unpredictability, allowing them to target both military forces and civilians while minimizing their direct engagement.

Understanding insurgent IED strategies is essential for counter-IED (C-IED) efforts, as it informs **EOD teams**, **military commanders**, and **law enforcement** on the methods insurgents employ and helps develop effective countermeasures.

### 1. **IED as a Weapon of Asymmetrical Warfare**
IEDs are often referred to as the **“weapon of the weak”**, allowing insurgents to counterbalance the overwhelming conventional military superiority of a state or occupying force. They exploit the element of surprise, using **low-cost materials** to inflict **high-cost damage**.

The strategic goals of insurgents using IEDs include:
- **Psychological Impact**: Instilling fear and uncertainty among enemy forces and civilian populations. IEDs can disrupt daily life, lower morale, and weaken the resolve of occupying forces.
- **Disruption**: Disrupting military operations, logistics, and supply chains. IEDs are used to slow down convoys, restrict movement, and force the enemy into a defensive posture.
- **Attrition**: Inflicting casualties and causing material losses over time. IEDs are used to wear down military forces by forcing them to expend resources on protection and countermeasures.
- **Media Attention**: High-profile attacks using IEDs often attract media attention, helping insurgents spread their message or highlight their ability to strike even against heavily fortified targets.
- **Political Leverage**: By creating a sense of instability, insurgents use IEDs to delegitimize government control and sow discord within the local population or the broader international community.

### 2. **Common Insurgency IED Tactics**
Insurgents use a wide variety of tactics to deploy IEDs, adapting their methods to suit different environments and specific targets. The following are the most common tactics observed in insurgency warfare:

#### a. **Roadside Bombing (Route IEDs)**
One of the most common insurgent tactics involves placing IEDs along roads frequently used by military convoys or patrols. These are often **buried IEDs** or placed in **culverts**, **vegetation**, or **debris** near roadways.

- **Tactic**: IEDs are positioned along likely routes of military or logistical convoys, with the intention of damaging vehicles and personnel. They can be triggered remotely, by pressure plates, or by tripwires.
- **Objective**: To **destroy vehicles**, cause **casualties**, and disrupt military movements.
- **Techniques**:
  - **Pressure plates** or **infrared (IR) sensors** to trigger the device when a vehicle passes over it.
  - **Command detonation** using radio or mobile phone signals to activate the bomb once the convoy is in the [[kill zone]].
  - **Decoy IEDs** used to distract or delay convoys, making them vulnerable to real, concealed devices.
  
  **Example**: A pressure-plate IED is buried under the asphalt of a road frequently used by military convoys. As a heavy vehicle passes over it, the pressure closes the circuit, triggering the explosion.

#### b. **Complex IED Ambush**
Insurgents often combine IED attacks with **small-arms fire**, **rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs)**, or other direct fire to maximize the effectiveness of their ambushes. These are known as **complex attacks**.

- **Tactic**: A combination of IEDs and direct fire is used to create confusion and overwhelm the target, maximizing casualties and destruction.
- **Objective**: To trap and **ambush** military units, leading to higher casualties by combining explosive damage with direct-fire weapons.
- **Techniques**:
  - IEDs are used to disable or stop a vehicle in a **[[kill zone]]**, followed by an ambush using rifles, RPGs, or machine guns.
  - **Secondary IEDs** are placed to target reinforcements or medical evacuation teams that respond to the initial attack.
  
  **Example**: An IED disables a lead vehicle in a convoy, forcing it to stop. Insurgents open fire from nearby concealed positions, and as reinforcements arrive, a secondary IED is detonated to inflict additional casualties.

#### c. **Vehicle-Borne IEDs (VBIEDs)**
VBIEDs are vehicles packed with explosives, used to target **military checkpoints**, **convoys**, **government buildings**, or **high-profile individuals**. The vehicles are driven to the target and detonated either remotely, via timer, or by a suicide bomber.

- **Tactic**: The vehicle is used to **bypass security** and get close to the target before detonation. VBIEDs are effective in urban areas or against fortified positions.
- **Objective**: To cause **massive destruction**, breach **security perimeters**, and instill fear in both military personnel and civilians.
- **Techniques**:
  - **Suicide VBIEDs**, where the driver manually detonates the device upon reaching the target.
  - **Remote-detonated VBIEDs**, where the vehicle is parked or driven close to the target and detonated remotely.
  - **Convoy tactics**, where VBIEDs are disguised as part of a convoy to reduce suspicion.

  **Example**: A truck loaded with explosives is driven toward a military checkpoint. Upon reaching the gate, the driver detonates the VBIED, breaching the perimeter and causing heavy casualties.

#### d. **Houseborne IEDs (HBIEDs)**
HBIEDs involve placing explosives inside **buildings**, **homes**, or **structures** to target military forces conducting **urban operations**. Insurgents often rig these buildings with IEDs to target clearing teams, or they place IEDs in doorways, windows, or furniture.

- **Tactic**: IEDs are concealed inside structures likely to be entered by military forces, such as abandoned houses or checkpoints.
- **Objective**: To target **clearing teams**, **demolition units**, or **security forces** performing **search-and-clear missions** in urban areas.
- **Techniques**:
  - **Booby traps** are placed under doors, behind walls, or in furniture to detonate when disturbed.
  - **Pressure-release devices** in doors or windows, which detonate when opened or lifted.
  - **False floors** or **ceiling bombs** to catch soldiers entering the building off-guard.

  **Example**: A building suspected of being used by insurgents is rigged with IEDs. When military personnel enter the house to clear it, they trip a pressure-release device hidden in a door frame, triggering an explosion.

#### e. **IED in False Targets**
Insurgents may use **decoys** or **false targets** to lure military forces into IED ambushes. These tactics often involve placing fake or non-explosive devices in plain sight to attract attention, while real IEDs are hidden nearby.

- **Tactic**: Decoy devices are used to **distract or lure** security forces into the real danger zone.
- **Objective**: To exploit the standard operating procedures of **EOD units** or **convoys** by placing fake IEDs in visible locations, while real IEDs are concealed in less obvious places.
- **Techniques**:
  - Decoy IEDs are made to look like real bombs, but they do not detonate. The real IED is placed at a safe distance where it will detonate when approached or tampered with.
  - **Secondary IEDs** are used to target bomb squads once they focus on the visible device.

  **Example**: A fake IED is left in plain sight at a checkpoint, leading soldiers to inspect it. While they focus on the fake device, a real IED, hidden nearby in a trash bin, is remotely detonated.

#### f. **IEDs in Civilian Crowds or Areas**
Insurgents may use IEDs to target **civilian populations** or areas of **public congregation** to create chaos, inflict civilian casualties, and destabilize local governments.

- **Tactic**: IEDs are placed in crowded areas, such as markets, religious gatherings, or transportation hubs, to cause maximum civilian casualties and sow fear.
- **Objective**: To create **psychological terror**, damage infrastructure, and weaken government authority by attacking vulnerable civilian targets.
- **Techniques**:
  - **Timed IEDs** are placed in busy markets or bus stops, detonating during peak hours.
  - **VBIEDs** are used to target crowded areas or political rallies.

  **Example**: An IED is placed in a crowded marketplace, hidden inside a trash can. It is set to detonate during the busiest time of day, causing mass casualties.

### 3. **Advanced Tactics and Evolving Techniques**
Insurgent groups continually adapt their tactics to **counter military counter-IED efforts**. As security forces improve their detection, jamming, and disarmament techniques, insurgents develop more sophisticated ways to deploy IEDs.

#### a. **Layered IED Attacks**
A **layered IED attack** involves using multiple IEDs in a sequence to target security forces and any potential rescue or recovery teams.
