Belbin's "Implementer" team role


**ASSISTANT**

The "Implementer" is one of the nine team roles identified by Meredith Belbin in his Team Roles model. Implementers are the practical organizers within a team, known for their reliability, efficiency, and a practical approach to tackling tasks. They turn ideas into actions and plans into reality, playing a crucial role in ensuring that projects are completed on time and to standard.

### Characteristics of the Implementer

**Strengths**: Implementers are disciplined, reliable, and conservative in a beneficial way. They excel in organization and follow-through, taking responsibility seriously and focusing on getting the job done.

**Behavioral Traits**:
- Implementers are methodical and work systematically, making them highly efficient at creating actionable plans.
- They prefer well-established ways of doing things and often rely on proven methods rather than innovation.
- Typically, they are detail-oriented, ensuring no aspect of a project is overlooked.

### Contributions to the Team

1. **Execution of Plans**: Implementers excel in taking plans and turning them into executable tasks, ensuring thorough preparation and practical organization.
2. **Maintaining Systems**: They help establish and maintain structures and processes within the team, ensuring that practices are followed and standards are met.
3. **Dependability**: You can count on Implementers to deliver on their promises, providing a stable foundation for team activities.

### Allowable Weaknesses

While Implementers are invaluable for their practical approach, they also come with potential weaknesses:
- **Resistance to Change**: Due to their preference for tried-and-tested methods, Implementers may resist new ideas or innovations that deviate from traditional practices.
- **Lack of Flexibility**: They might struggle to adapt when rapid change or unorthodox solutions are necessary.
- **Focus on Practicality**: Sometimes, their focus on practicality can stifle creativity within the team.

### Managing an Implementer

To ensure that Implementers are effective and their skills are used optimally, consider the following strategies:
- Involve them in planning stages where their practical insight can ensure plans are feasible.
- Encourage them to stay open to new methods and innovations by gradually integrating changes in a structured way.
- Provide opportunities for them to develop leadership skills in operational settings where they can manage processes or systems.

### Ideal Scenarios for Implementers

Implementers are particularly valuable in roles that require organizational skills, attention to detail, and a systematic approach to work. They thrive in structured environments where they can apply their planning and management skills, such as in project management, operations, administration, and any context where execution and consistency are paramount.

In summary, the Implementer role in Belbinâ€™s model is essential for translating team goals into structured, manageable tasks and ensuring that plans are executed efficiently. Their ability to organize and maintain work processes helps teams achieve practical results and maintain high standards of quality and reliability.
