Minimal sufficient statistic


**ASSISTANT**

A **minimal sufficient statistic** is a type of sufficient statistic that captures the minimal amount of information needed to estimate a parameter without losing any information about the parameter. This concept is important because it helps in reducing the dimensionality of the data more efficiently than any other sufficient statistic.

### Definition
Formally, a statistic \( T(X) \) is called minimal sufficient for a parameter \( \theta \) if it is sufficient and, for any other sufficient statistic \( S(X) \), there exists a function \( f \) such that:
$$
T(X) = f(S(X))
$$

### Construction and Characterization
To construct a minimal sufficient statistic, we typically start with the Fisher-Neyman factorization theorem. For a given sample \( X = (X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n) \) with a joint probability density function (pdf) or probability mass function (pmf) \( f_{X|\theta}(x|\theta) \), \( T(X) \) is minimal sufficient if, for any two samples \( x \) and \( y \), the ratio of their likelihoods depends on \( \theta \) only through \( T(x) \) and \( T(y) \).

### Mathematical Formalism
A statistic \( T(X) \) is minimal sufficient if it satisfies the following condition: for any two sample points \( x \) and \( y \),
$$
\frac{f_{X|\theta}(x|\theta)}{f_{X|\theta}(y|\theta)} \text{ is independent of } \theta \text{ if and only if } T(x) = T(y).
$$

### Examples
1. **Bernoulli Distribution**: Suppose \( X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n \) are i.i.d. Bernoulli random variables with parameter \( \theta \). The sufficient statistic is \( T(X) = \sum_{i=1}^n X_i \). Since there is only one sufficient statistic here, it is also minimal sufficient.

2. **Normal Distribution**: Consider \( X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n \) are i.i.d. normal random variables with mean \( \mu \) and variance \( \sigma^2 \). The pair \( T(X) = \left( \sum_{i=1}^n X_i, \sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2 \right) \) is sufficient for \( (\mu, \sigma^2) \). To determine minimal sufficiency, consider:
   - The sample mean \( \bar{X} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i \)
   - The sample variance \( S^2 = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \bar{X})^2 \)

   Here, the minimal sufficient statistics are \( \left(\sum_{i=1}^n X_i, \sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2\right) \), as they can be used to reconstruct both the mean and variance without losing information about the parameters.

### Group Invariance
One approach to identify minimal sufficient statistics is through group invariance. If the distribution of \( X \) is invariant under a group of transformations, then the minimal sufficient statistic is typically a maximal invariant under this group. This method relies on the concept of [[Group Theory]] in statistics.

### Examples in Exponential Families
For distributions in the [[Exponential Family|exponential family]], minimal sufficient statistics are often apparent from the natural parameterization. Recall the form:
$$
f_{X|\theta}(x|\theta) = h(x) \exp\left( \eta(\theta)^T T(x) - A(\theta) \right)
$$
Here, \( T(x) \) is both sufficient and minimal sufficient, provided the parameter space and data space are appropriately chosen.

### Practical Importance
Minimal sufficient statistics are particularly useful because they provide the most parsimonious summary of the data with respect to the parameter of interest. Using minimal sufficient statistics can simplify both theoretical analyses and practical computations in statistical inference. For instance, they are central in constructing [[Rao-Blackwell estimators]], which are often optimal among unbiased estimators.

### Summary
A minimal sufficient statistic is a sufficient statistic that retains no redundant information about the parameter. It serves as the most efficient summarization of the sample data with respect to the parameter. Understanding and identifying minimal sufficient statistics are fundamental tasks in the theory of statistical inference, leading to more efficient data analysis and parameter estimation.

For further reading, you might explore topics such as the [[Lehmann-Scheff√© theorem]], which utilizes minimal sufficiency to identify uniformly minimum variance unbiased estimators (UMVUEs), or the role of sufficiency in the context of [[Bayesian Inference]].
