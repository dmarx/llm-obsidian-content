Variational Equations


**ASSISTANT**

Variational equations play a crucial role in the study of dynamical systems, particularly in stability analysis, [[bifurcation theory]], and the computation of Lyapunov exponents. These equations describe the evolution of small perturbations to the trajectories of a dynamical system and are essential for understanding how nearby trajectories diverge or converge.

## Overview

### Dynamical Systems

Consider a dynamical system described by ordinary differential equations (ODEs):

$$
\frac{d\mathbf{x}}{dt} = \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}, \mu),
$$

where \(\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n\) is the state vector, \(\mathbf{f} : \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n\) is a vector field, and \(\mu\) is a parameter.

### Perturbations and Variational Equations

To study the behavior of small perturbations around a trajectory \(\mathbf{x}(t)\), we consider a perturbed trajectory \(\mathbf{x}(t) + \delta \mathbf{x}(t)\). The evolution of the perturbation \(\delta \mathbf{x}(t)\) is governed by the variational equations, which are derived by linearizing the original system around the trajectory \(\mathbf{x}(t)\).

## Derivation of Variational Equations

### Linearization

Given the nonlinear system:

$$
\frac{d\mathbf{x}}{dt} = \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}, \mu),
$$

we introduce a small perturbation \(\delta \mathbf{x}(t)\) and expand \(\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x} + \delta \mathbf{x}, \mu)\) in a Taylor series around \(\mathbf{x}\):

$$
\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x} + \delta \mathbf{x}, \mu) \approx \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}, \mu) + \frac{\partial \mathbf{f}}{\partial \mathbf{x}} \Bigg|_{\mathbf{x}} \delta \mathbf{x}.
$$

The term \(\frac{\partial \mathbf{f}}{\partial \mathbf{x}} \Big|_{\mathbf{x}} = J(\mathbf{x})\) is the Jacobian matrix of \(\mathbf{f}\) evaluated at \(\mathbf{x}\).

### Variational Equations

The evolution of the perturbation \(\delta \mathbf{x}(t)\) is given by the variational equations:

$$
\frac{d(\delta \mathbf{x})}{dt} = J(\mathbf{x}(t)) \delta \mathbf{x},
$$

where \(J(\mathbf{x}(t))\) is the Jacobian matrix evaluated along the trajectory \(\mathbf{x}(t)\).

## Numerical Integration

### Coupled System

To integrate the variational equations numerically, we solve the original system and the variational equations as a coupled system:

$$
\begin{cases}
\frac{d\mathbf{x}}{dt} = \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}, \mu), \\
\frac{d(\delta \mathbf{x})}{dt} = J(\mathbf{x}(t)) \delta \mathbf{x}.
\end{cases}
$$

### Initial Conditions

Choose an initial condition \(\mathbf{x}(0) = \mathbf{x}_0\) for the state vector and a set of linearly independent initial perturbations \(\delta \mathbf{x}_1(0), \delta \mathbf{x}_2(0), \ldots, \delta \mathbf{x}_n(0)\).

### Integration Methods

Common numerical methods for integrating the coupled system include:

- **Runge-Kutta Methods**: Higher-order methods such as the fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) are commonly used for their accuracy and stability.
- **Multistep Methods**: Methods like the Adams-Bashforth and Adams-Moulton methods can also be used, particularly for stiff systems.

## Applications

### Stability Analysis

The variational equations are used to determine the stability of fixed points and periodic orbits by analyzing the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix.

- **Fixed Points**: The stability is determined by the eigenvalues of \(J(\mathbf{x}_0)\), where \(\mathbf{x}_0\) is the fixed point.
- **Periodic Orbits**: The stability is determined by the Floquet multipliers, which are the eigenvalues of the monodromy matrix obtained by integrating the variational equations over one period of the orbit.

### Lyapunov Exponents

Lyapunov exponents quantify the rates of separation of nearby trajectories. The variational equations are used in algorithms like the Benettin algorithm to compute the full spectrum of Lyapunov exponents.

### Sensitivity Analysis

Variational equations are used to study the sensitivity of a system to changes in initial conditions or parameters, providing insights into how small perturbations grow or decay over time.

### Control Theory

In control theory, variational equations are used to design and analyze control strategies by understanding how small changes in control inputs affect the system's behavior.

## Example

### Lorenz System

Consider the Lorenz system:

$$
\begin{cases}
\frac{dx}{dt} = \sigma (y - x), \\
\frac{dy}{dt} = x (\rho - z) - y, \\
\frac{dz}{dt} = xy - \beta z.
\end{cases}
$$

The variational equations for small perturbations \(\delta \mathbf{x} = (\delta x, \delta y, \delta z)\) are:

$$
\frac{d}{dt} \begin{pmatrix} \delta x \\ \delta y \\ \delta z \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
-\sigma & \sigma & 0 \\
\rho - z & -1 & -x \\
y & x & -\beta
\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \delta x \\ \delta y \\ \delta z \end{pmatrix}.
$$

To numerically integrate this system along with the original Lorenz system, we would use an appropriate integration method (e.g., RK4) and periodically reorthonormalize the deviation vectors to maintain numerical stability.
