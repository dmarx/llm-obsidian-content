wake formation


**ASSISTANT**

**Wake formation** refers to the region of disturbed flow that forms behind a body moving through a fluid, such as air or water, or when fluid flows past a stationary object. This region is characterized by **low-pressure**, **turbulent**, and **recirculating flow** patterns and is a consequence of **[[boundary layer separation]]**, which occurs when the fluid detaches from the surface of the object.

The wake plays a crucial role in the **aerodynamic drag** and **energy dissipation** associated with the flow past the object. The size, shape, and structure of the wake depend on several factors, including the object’s shape, the flow velocity, and the Reynolds number.

### Causes of Wake Formation

Wake formation occurs when the fluid flow around an object is significantly disturbed, especially when **[[boundary layer separation]]** happens. As the fluid moves past the object, the boundary layer of the fluid (which experiences viscous effects near the surface) is slowed down and eventually detaches from the surface when it can no longer overcome the adverse pressure gradient. This creates a region of **vortices** and **low-momentum fluid** behind the object, where the flow is unsteady and turbulent.

The key mechanisms behind wake formation are:
1. **Boundary layer separation**: When the boundary layer detaches from the surface due to an adverse pressure gradient, fluid recirculation occurs, creating vortices and unsteady flow patterns.
2. **Flow instabilities**: After separation, the flow behind the object is prone to instabilities, especially at higher Reynolds numbers, leading to turbulence in the wake.

### Types of Wakes

Wakes can be categorized into **laminar** and **turbulent wakes**, depending on the Reynolds number of the flow and the characteristics of the separation.

#### 1. **Laminar Wake**
At **low Reynolds numbers** (typically $Re < 10^3$), the wake is smooth and steady. The fluid behind the object is relatively stable, and the wake remains mostly laminar with small disturbances. In this regime, the separation of the boundary layer happens relatively early, and the wake is narrow and symmetric.

#### 2. **Turbulent Wake**
At **higher Reynolds numbers** (typically $Re > 10^4$), the wake becomes turbulent. The boundary layer may transition to turbulence before or after separation, and the wake contains chaotic eddies and vortices. The turbulent wake is highly unsteady, with complex flow patterns, leading to greater energy dissipation and larger pressure drag. This turbulent wake is often associated with **vortex shedding**, where vortices are alternately shed from opposite sides of the object.

### Factors Affecting Wake Formation

1. **Shape of the Object**
   - **Bluff bodies** (such as cylinders, spheres, and square objects) have large separated wakes due to significant flow separation. The separation point is fixed and occurs relatively early on the surface, creating a wide wake.
   - **Streamlined bodies** (such as airfoils or fish-like shapes) are designed to minimize flow separation, delaying the onset of boundary layer detachment and reducing the size of the wake. These shapes minimize drag by allowing the flow to remain attached to the surface for longer.

2. **Reynolds Number ($Re$)**
   The **Reynolds number**, which characterizes the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces in the flow, plays a crucial role in wake formation.
   - At low Reynolds numbers (laminar flow), the wake is steady and narrow.
   - At moderate Reynolds numbers (around $10^3 < Re < 10^5$), the flow becomes unstable, leading to vortex shedding.
   - At high Reynolds numbers (turbulent flow), the wake is highly unsteady and chaotic, with increased mixing and a larger wake region.

3. **Flow Speed**
   The higher the flow speed relative to the object, the more pronounced the wake and the more intense the turbulence behind the object. At high flow velocities, the energy lost to turbulence in the wake increases, resulting in greater pressure drag.

4. **Surface Roughness**
   The roughness of the surface of the object can affect the boundary layer's transition to turbulence, which in turn influences wake formation. Rough surfaces can induce earlier boundary layer transition to turbulence, potentially delaying separation and reducing wake size in some cases (e.g., dimples on a golf ball).

### Vortex Shedding

In the wake of **bluff bodies**, such as cylinders or spheres, the flow alternates between shedding vortices from opposite sides of the object. This phenomenon is called **vortex shedding**, and it occurs at moderate to high Reynolds numbers. The vortices form a repeating pattern known as a **von Kármán vortex street**.

- **Vortex shedding frequency** is characterized by the **Strouhal number** ($St$):
  $$
  St = \frac{f L}{u}
  $$
  where:
  - $f$ is the vortex shedding frequency,
  - $L$ is a characteristic length (e.g., diameter of the cylinder),
  - $u$ is the free-stream velocity.

Vortex shedding can induce **oscillations** in the object, which can lead to structural vibrations and even **resonance** if the shedding frequency matches the natural frequency of the structure (e.g., **aeroelastic flutter** in bridges or towers).

### Drag and Wake Formation

The **drag** experienced by an object in a fluid consists of two main components:
1. **Friction drag**: Caused by shear forces due to the viscosity of the fluid. This drag is related to the boundary layer’s development and the interaction between the fluid and the surface.
2. **Pressure drag (form drag)**: Caused by the pressure difference between the front and rear of the object. Pressure drag is directly related to wake formation, as the large wake region behind the object lowers the pressure, leading to increased drag.

- **Bluff bodies** experience high pressure drag due to large wake regions and early [[boundary layer separation]].
- **Streamlined bodies** are designed to minimize pressure drag by delaying flow separation, resulting in a smaller wake and smoother flow.

### Examples of Wake Formation

1. **Flow Around a Cylinder**:
   The classic example of wake formation is the flow around a circular cylinder. At low Reynolds numbers, the wake is laminar and symmetric, but as the Reynolds number increases, the wake becomes turbulent, and vortex shedding occurs. The resulting **von Kármán vortex street** causes oscillating forces on the cylinder.

2. **Automobiles and Airplanes**:
   In the design of vehicles and aircraft, reducing the size of the wake is crucial for improving aerodynamic efficiency. Streamlined shapes are used to minimize wake formation, reduce drag, and improve fuel efficiency.

3. **Ships and Submarines**:
   Wake formation in water can be highly turbulent, leading to energy loss and drag. The wake behind a ship can also be visually observed as waves and eddies. **Hydrodynamic designs** aim to reduce the size of the wake by streamlining the hull.

### Controlling Wake Formation

To reduce wake formation and improve the efficiency of fluid systems, several strategies are used:

1. **Streamlining**: Designing objects with streamlined shapes reduces flow separation and minimizes the wake. This is commonly used in vehicles, aircraft, and submarines.
  
2. **Vortex Generators**: Small fins or vanes, called **vortex generators**, can be added to surfaces (e.g., aircraft wings) to energize the boundary layer, delaying separation and reducing the wake size.
  
3. **Surface Roughness**: On some surfaces, roughness can induce an early transition to turbulence in the boundary layer, which can delay separation and reduce drag (e.g., dimples on a golf ball).

4. **Blowing and Suction**: Active flow control techniques, such as blowing high-speed air near the separation point or suctioning low-momentum fluid from the boundary layer, can delay separation and reduce the wake size.

### Summary

**Wake formation** occurs when fluid flow separates from the surface of an object, creating a region of disturbed, low-pressure, and often turbulent flow behind the object. The wake is influenced by factors such as the shape of the object, the Reynolds number, and the nature of the flow. Wake formation leads to increased **pressure drag**, and controlling or reducing the wake is important for improving aerodynamic efficiency in many engineering applications.
