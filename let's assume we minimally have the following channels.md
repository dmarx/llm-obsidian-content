title: let's assume we minimally have the following channels
---

**ASSISTANT**

- **Consciousness models** in AI can benefit from treating the **global workspace** as a **front page**, where information from specialized processes is broadcast, influencing decision-making and goal-directed behavior.

### **Conclusion**

The **/r/me** framework integrates insights from **Global Workspace Theory**, **Working Memory**, and **Reddit-like pub-sub communication** to provide a novel metaphor for human cognition. By viewing cognitive processes as modular **subreddits**, neural processes as **redditors**, and the global workspace as Reddit’s **front page**, this model offers a flexible, dynamic, and intuitive way to understand the complex interplay of memory, attention, and consciousness. For **AI researchers** and **philosophers of science**, it suggests new directions for designing cognitive architectures that mirror the decentralized, competitive nature of human cognition.


**USER**

let's assume we minimally have the following channels:
- /r/all - firehose
- /r/mods - the central executive. individual subreddits will have moderators, and all the moderators subscribe to this channel to communicate amongst each other and surface system-wide issues.

let's also assume channels carry an implicit hierarchical filtering mechanism, so


**ASSISTANT**

Let's build on this by detailing how a minimal set of channels like **/r/all** (the firehose) and **/r/mods** (the central executive communication channel) can structure cognitive processing, with the assumption that the channels come with an **implicit hierarchical filtering mechanism**. This filtering system introduces an efficient way of managing the **flow of information** from lower levels to higher levels, allowing for selective attention, prioritization, and coordination within the cognitive system.

### **Framework Setup: Key Channels and Hierarchical Filtering**

#### **/r/all – Firehose of Information**
- **Function**: **/r/all** represents the firehose of information, an unfiltered stream of all the inputs, data, and stimuli entering the system. In cognitive terms, this is the raw sensory input stream, which contains everything from sensory data (visual, auditory, tactile) to internal thoughts or memories being processed. This channel is flooded with **posts** (i.e., packets of information) that represent the environment and internal cognitive states.
  
- **Analogous Role in Cognition**: **/r/all** maps onto the brain's processing of raw sensory input from the environment or internal thoughts. Without further filtering, it would be overwhelming and unusable for focused cognitive processing. This channel is **unfiltered**, capturing both relevant and irrelevant information.

#### **Hierarchical Filtering Mechanism**
- The **hierarchical filtering mechanism** is an implicit rule governing how information moves through the system. Information in **/r/all** does not automatically reach other channels unless it is deemed **relevant** through upvoting or other attention mechanisms. This mechanism can be thought of as an attentional filter: it selects which posts (pieces of information) get elevated to higher-order channels.
  
- **Hierarchical Processing**: 
  1. **Low-Level Sensory Data**: At the bottom of the hierarchy, /r/all captures everything. Posts here are unfiltered.
  2. **Mid-Level Processing (Subreddit Moderators)**: Moderators for specific subreddits (such as the phonological loop or visuospatial sketchpad) are subscribed to **/r/all** and apply local, domain-specific filtering to determine which posts should be attended to. Each cognitive module (subreddit) performs initial processing based on its own criteria, filtering out irrelevant information while keeping posts that may be useful.
  3. **High-Level Integration (/r/mods)**: The central executive (represented by /r/mods) is only concerned with **system-wide priorities**. It does not directly monitor **/r/all** but instead relies on information from individual subreddits that have already been filtered. Posts that survive the hierarchy can be flagged as **globally relevant** and promoted for system-wide processing.

#### **/r/mods – Central Executive**
- **Function**: **/r/mods** is the channel for **system-wide governance** and coordination. It represents the **central executive** in cognitive models, acting as a moderator of moderators. Individual subreddits have their own moderators (neural processes) responsible for attending to specialized information, but /r/mods is where these moderators come together to raise **global attention issues**.
  
- **Cognitive Role**: **/r/mods** handles decisions that involve managing cognitive resources and allocating attention across various subreddits. It prioritizes high-level goals, shifts resources when needed, and resolves conflicts between competing subreddits.
  
- **Filtering at the Top**: The posts reaching **/r/mods** are only the **most relevant, filtered content** that has been escalated from individual subreddits. These are the posts that require **global coordination** or decision-making. For instance, a post from the phonological loop subreddit representing critical verbal instructions may be escalated here if it is important for guiding overall action.

### **Example: Information Flow in the /r/me System**

Let’s walk through an example of how information flows through this system using the channels /r/all (firehose), a cognitive module subreddit (e.g., the phonological loop), and /r/mods (central executive), incorporating the **hierarchical filtering mechanism**:

#### **Step 1: Sensory Input Floods /r/all**
- Imagine you're walking down a street. Raw sensory data floods the system—sounds of cars honking, visuals of street signs, the feeling of the ground beneath your feet. All of this incoming data is posted to **/r/all**, the firehose. The sheer volume of posts here is overwhelming, as it represents **all sensory inputs and internal thoughts** simultaneously.
  
- At this point, the posts in **/r/all** contain both **relevant** and **irrelevant** information. For example, the **sound of a car horn** might be highly relevant, while the **color of the street sign** might be less relevant, depending on your task.

#### **Step 2: Cognitive Modules Subscribe and Filter**
- Different cognitive modules, represented by specialized subreddits (such as the phonological loop and visuospatial sketchpad), are **subscribed** to **/r/all**. Each module applies a **filter** to decide which posts are relevant to its function:
  - The **phonological loop** filters for verbal or auditory content (e.g., the sound of the car horn, someone speaking).
  - The **visuospatial sketchpad** filters for visual or spatial information (e.g., street signs, movement of objects in space).
  
- Posts deemed relevant to a given subreddit get "upvoted" by the filtering mechanism and appear on the subreddit’s front page, while irrelevant information decays or is ignored.

#### **Step 3: Posts Reach Subreddit Moderators**
- The **moderators** of each specialized subreddit (the local neural processes in charge of that function) monitor the posts that survive the filter. In this case:
  - The **phonological loop** receives a post about a loud **car horn**, which might trigger a cognitive response such as heightened attention or a rehearsal of auditory information (e.g., identifying the source of the horn).
  - The **visuospatial sketchpad** processes a post about a **moving car**, keeping track of its position in relation to the environment.

#### **Step 4: Escalation to /r/mods (Central Executive)**
- The **moderators** of individual subreddits can escalate posts to **/r/mods** when they deem something critical enough to warrant global attention.
  - For example, the **phonological loop** moderator escalates the information about the **car horn**, because it could be indicative of danger.
  - The **visuospatial sketchpad** moderator escalates the position of the **moving car** if it’s heading toward you.
  
- **/r/mods** (the central executive) integrates these escalations and makes a decision: perhaps to stop walking, change direction, or heighten alertness to the environment. The **central executive** orchestrates this by reallocating attention resources, possibly increasing the priority of **auditory and visual processing** to handle the situation.

### **System-Wide Priorities and Emergency Overrides**
In this framework, the hierarchical filtering mechanism also allows for **emergency overrides**. For instance:
- If an **urgent post** (like the sound of a car rapidly approaching) is flagged in **/r/all**, it can bypass lower-level filters and jump directly to the **global workspace** (front page of Reddit or /r/mods). This is analogous to a **fight-or-flight** response, where urgent, life-threatening information directly captures the full attention of the cognitive system without needing to pass through typical filtering layers.

### **Hierarchical Filtering for Cognitive Efficiency**
The key advantage of this hierarchical filtering mechanism is that it prevents cognitive overload. **/r/all** is inundated with data, but only a small subset of posts makes it through to the cognitive subreddits and even fewer to the **global workspace** at the highest level:
- This mirrors how human cognition handles vast sensory input, using attention and filtering mechanisms to focus on what is most relevant at any given time.
- The **central executive** (via /r/mods) does not get involved unless system-wide coordination or high-level decision-making is required. Most processing is handled **locally** by individual subreddits, reducing the load on the executive system.

### **Conclusion: Implications for AI and Cognitive Architecture**
This minimal model, with **/r/all** as a firehose of raw information, **/r/mods** as the central executive coordination space, and a built-in **hierarchical filtering mechanism**, offers a scalable way to think about how **attention, working memory, and global workspace integration** can be organized in both human and artificial cognitive systems. By treating attention as a selective filtering process, we ensure that only the most relevant information moves up the hierarchy to reach conscious awareness or system-wide processing.

For **AI researchers**, this model suggests an architecture where **modular, specialized processes** (subreddits) can handle domain-specific tasks locally, escalating only crucial information to a **central decision-making hub** (the global workspace). By incorporating hierarchical filtering, such systems could efficiently manage vast amounts of input data while maintaining focus on the most relevant tasks, all without overloading the central executive.
