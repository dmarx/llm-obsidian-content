Adaptation Mechanisms

### Adaptation Mechanisms in Adaptive Control

Adaptation mechanisms are fundamental components in [[adaptive control]] systems, enabling the real-time adjustment of controller parameters to handle uncertainties, variations in system dynamics, and disturbances. These mechanisms ensure that the control system maintains optimal performance even when the system model is not perfectly known or changes over time.

### Types of Adaptation Mechanisms

1. **Gradient Descent Methods**
2. **Lyapunov-Based Methods**
3. **Recursive Least Squares (RLS)**
4. **Normalized Least Mean Squares (NLMS)**
5. **Robust Adaptive Mechanisms**

### 1. Gradient Descent Methods

Gradient descent methods update the controller parameters in the direction that minimizes a predefined cost function, typically based on the tracking error.

#### Adaptation Law

The adaptation law for gradient descent can be expressed as:
$$
\dot{\theta}(t) = -\gamma \nabla_\theta J(\theta, t),
$$
where:
- \( \theta(t) \) is the parameter vector.
- \( \gamma \) is the adaptation gain.
- \( J(\theta, t) \) is the cost function, often defined as the squared tracking error: \( J(\theta, t) = e^2(t) = (y(t) - y_m(t))^2 \).
- \( \nabla_\theta J(\theta, t) \) is the gradient of the cost function with respect to the parameters.

For a system with output \( y(t) \) and reference model output \( y_m(t) \):
$$
\dot{\theta}(t) = -\gamma e(t) \phi(t),
$$
where \( e(t) = y(t) - y_m(t) \) is the tracking error, and \( \phi(t) \) is the regressor vector.

### 2. Lyapunov-Based Methods

Lyapunov-based methods ensure stability by designing adaptation laws that guarantee the Lyapunov function's derivative is negative semi-definite.

#### Lyapunov Function

A typical Lyapunov function for [[adaptive control]] is:
$$
V(e, \tilde{\theta}) = \frac{1}{2} e^T P e + \frac{1}{2} \tilde{\theta}^T \Gamma^{-1} \tilde{\theta},
$$
where:
- \( e = y - y_m \) is the tracking error.
- \( \tilde{\theta} = \theta - \theta^* \) is the parameter estimation error.
- \( P \) is a positive definite matrix.
- \( \Gamma \) is the adaptation gain matrix.

#### Adaptation Law

The adaptation law is derived to ensure:
$$
\dot{V} = -e^T Q e \leq 0,
$$
where \( Q \) is a positive definite matrix. This can lead to an adaptation law of the form:
$$
\dot{\theta}(t) = -\Gamma \phi(t) e(t).
$$

### 3. Recursive Least Squares (RLS)

RLS is an efficient algorithm for parameter estimation in [[adaptive control]]. It minimizes the cumulative squared error between the predicted and actual system outputs.

#### RLS Algorithm

For a system model \( y(t) = \theta^T(t) \phi(t) + \epsilon(t) \):
$$
\theta(t+1) = \theta(t) + L(t) [y(t) - \theta^T(t) \phi(t)],
$$
where:
- \( L(t) \) is the gain matrix:
  $$ L(t) = \frac{P(t) \phi(t)}{1 + \phi^T(t) P(t) \phi(t)}, $$
- \( P(t) \) is the covariance matrix updated by:
  $$ P(t+1) = P(t) - \frac{P(t) \phi(t) \phi^T(t) P(t)}{1 + \phi^T(t) P(t) \phi(t)}. $$

### 4. Normalized Least Mean Squares (NLMS)

NLMS is an adaptation mechanism that normalizes the step size based on the input signal's power, improving convergence stability and speed.

#### NLMS Algorithm

For a parameter update:
$$
\theta(t+1) = \theta(t) + \frac{\mu}{\phi^T(t) \phi(t)} \phi(t) e(t),
$$
where:
- \( \mu \) is the step size.
- \( e(t) = y(t) - \theta^T(t) \phi(t) \) is the error.

### 5. Robust Adaptive Mechanisms

Robust adaptive mechanisms are designed to handle large uncertainties and disturbances, ensuring stability and performance even under adverse conditions.

#### Robust Adaptation Laws

Robust adaptation laws often incorporate modifications to standard adaptive laws to enhance stability and performance. For instance:
$$
\dot{\theta}(t) = -\gamma \phi(t) e(t) - \eta \text{sgn}(\theta(t)),
$$
where \( \eta \) is a small positive constant to mitigate parameter drift.

### Application Examples

#### 1. MRAC for a First-Order System

Consider a first-order system:
$$
\dot{x}(t) = -a x(t) + b u(t),
$$
with a reference model:
$$
\dot{x}_m(t) = -a_m x_m(t) + b_m r(t).
$$

##### Control Law

The control input is:
$$
u(t) = \theta_1(t) r(t) + \theta_2(t) x(t),
$$
with adaptation laws:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\dot{\theta}_1(t) &= \gamma r(t) e(t), \\
\dot{\theta}_2(t) &= \gamma x(t) e(t),
\end{aligned}
$$
where \( e(t) = x(t) - x_m(t) \).

#### 2. STR for a Discrete-Time System

Consider a discrete-time system:
$$
y(k+1) = a y(k) + b u(k) + \epsilon(k).
$$

##### RLS Algorithm

Parameter update using RLS:
$$
\theta(k+1) = \theta(k) + L(k) [y(k+1) - \theta^T(k) \phi(k)],
$$
with \( L(k) \) and \( P(k) \) updated as described.

### Conclusion

Adaptation mechanisms are crucial for ensuring the real-time adjustment of controller parameters, enabling [[adaptive control]] systems to maintain optimal performance under varying conditions. Techniques such as gradient descent, Lyapunov-based methods, RLS, NLMS, and robust adaptive mechanisms offer diverse strategies for achieving robust and [[adaptive control]]. For further exploration, consider topics such as [[Adaptive Control]], [[Recursive Least Squares]], and [[Lyapunov Stability Theory]].
