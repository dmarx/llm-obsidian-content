# Dimensional Analysis of Neural Network Scaling Laws

## Overview
[[Dimensional analysis]] provides a powerful framework for analyzing the relationships between various quantities in deep learning systems, similar to its applications in physics. This approach helps formalize and understand empirically-observed [[scaling laws]] that govern neural network performance.

## Core Quantities and Units

Let's define the fundamental quantities involved in neural network scaling:

- N: Number of parameters (dimensionless)
- D: Dataset size (samples)
- B: Batch size (samples/update)
- η: Learning rate (1/update)
- L: Loss value (dimensionless)
- C: Compute budget (FLOPs)

## Key Scaling Relationships

The [[power law scaling]] relationship commonly observed in neural network training can be expressed as:

L(N) = (N₀/N)^α

Where:
- L(N) is the loss as a function of model size
- N₀ is a problem-specific constant
- α is the scaling exponent (typically ≈ 0.5 for language models)

## Dimensional Consistency Analysis

The [[Buckingham π theorem]] suggests that the relationship between these quantities must be expressible in terms of dimensionless groups. Let's construct these:

π₁ = L (dimensionless)
π₂ = N (dimensionless)
π₃ = D/B (updates per epoch)
π₄ = ηB/N (effective learning rate per parameter)

## Compute-Optimal Scaling

The relationship between compute (C), parameters (N), and dataset size (D) follows:

C ∝ N·D

Under optimal allocation of compute budget, this leads to the relationship:

N* ∝ C^(2/3)
D* ∝ C^(1/3)

Where N* and D* represent compute-optimal model and dataset sizes.

## Important Derived Relations

1. [[Critical Batch Size]]:
   B_crit ∝ N^(1/4)

2. [[Memory-Compute Trade-off]]:
   M ∝ N
   C ∝ N·D

3. [[Training Dynamics Scaling]]:
   L(t) ∝ t^(-α)
   where t is training time

## Theoretical Foundations

The scaling relationships emerge from several theoretical considerations:

1. [[Information Theory Bounds]]:
   - Minimum bits needed to encode model parameters
   - Maximum information content extractable from dataset

2. [[Statistical Learning Theory]]:
   - [[Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension]] scaling with model size
   - [[Generalization error bounds]] as functions of N and D

3. [[Optimization Theory]]:
   - [[Neural Tangent Kernel]] regime analysis
   - [[Gradient noise scale]] dependencies

## Mathematical Formalization

Let's define a general scaling law function:

φ(N, D, B, η, t) = L

Subject to the constraint:
∀λ > 0: φ(λN, λD, λB, η/λ, t) = φ(N, D, B, η, t)

This [[homogeneity relation]] captures the fundamental scaling symmetries of neural network training.

## Empirical Validation Methods

To verify scaling laws:

1. [[Log-log regression analysis]]:
   log(L) = -α·log(N) + log(N₀)

2. [[Residual analysis]] for deviations from power law behavior:
   ε(N) = L(N) - (N₀/N)^α

3. [[Cross-validation]] across different model architectures and tasks

## Practical Implications

Understanding these scaling relationships enables:

1. [[Resource allocation optimization]]
2. [[Training trajectory prediction]]
3. [[Architecture search]] guidance
4. [[Cost-benefit analysis]] for model scaling decisions

## Open Questions

1. What determines the precise value of scaling exponents?
2. How do [[architecture-specific effects]] modify these laws?
3. Do these relationships hold in the limit N → ∞?
4. What role does [[model sparsity]] play in modifying these relationships?
