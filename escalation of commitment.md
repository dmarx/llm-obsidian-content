Escalation of Commitment


**ASSISTANT**

### Escalation of Commitment

#### Definition
**Escalation of commitment** is a psychological phenomenon where individuals or organizations continue to invest time, money, or effort into a decision despite evidence suggesting that the decision may be wrong or failing. This behavior often arises from a desire to justify previous investments, driven by cognitive biases such as the sunk cost fallacy.

#### Mechanisms of Escalation of Commitment in a Closed-Loop System

1. **Sunk Cost Fallacy**
   - **Explanation**: The sunk cost fallacy occurs when people make decisions based on previously invested resources rather than current outcomes. When customers purchase proprietary credits like Dave & Buster’s Power Cards, they may feel compelled to use up these credits to justify their initial expenditure.
   - **Example**: A customer buys $50 worth of game credits. Even if they aren't enjoying the games as much as expected, they might continue playing to "get their money's worth," thus spending more time and potentially buying more credits.

2. **Cognitive Dissonance**
   - **Explanation**: Cognitive dissonance refers to the discomfort people feel when their actions conflict with their beliefs or values. To reduce this discomfort, they might escalate their commitment to a decision to align their actions with their initial choice.
   - **Example**: A customer might believe that buying a large package of credits was a smart financial decision. If they find themselves with unused credits, they might continue spending to avoid admitting to themselves that they made a poor choice.

3. **Desire for Completion**
   - **Explanation**: People often have a strong desire to complete what they start. In the context of a proprietary currency system, this means they are likely to return to the venue to use up their remaining credits, thus spending more.
   - **Example**: If a customer leaves Dave & Buster's with a partially used Power Card, they are likely to return to use the remaining credits, leading to additional purchases of food, drinks, or more credits.

4. **Incremental Investment**
   - **Explanation**: Incremental investment involves gradually increasing one’s commitment to a course of action over time, making it harder to pull out as the investment grows.
   - **Example**: A customer might start by buying a small amount of credits. As they continue to enjoy their time, they may incrementally purchase more credits, leading to a significant cumulative investment over multiple visits.

### Practical Implications for Businesses

#### Enhancing Customer Retention
By understanding and leveraging the escalation of commitment, businesses can design their systems to encourage repeat visits and higher spending.

- **Bonus Credits**: Offering bonus credits for purchasing larger packages can incentivize customers to buy more initially, increasing their commitment.
- **Unused Credit Incentives**: Implementing strategies such as offering a small bonus for returning with an unused balance can encourage customers to come back.
- **Tiered Rewards**: Creating a tiered loyalty program where customers achieve higher status with more credits purchased or used can enhance commitment through incremental investment.

#### Increasing Revenue
Businesses can use escalation of commitment to drive higher overall spending.

- **Frequent Promotions**: Regular promotions that offer additional value for purchasing more credits can make customers more likely to continue spending.
- **Exclusive Offers**: Providing exclusive offers or experiences for customers who purchase large amounts of credits can further increase their commitment.

### Case Studies and Evidence

#### Case Study: Las Vegas Casinos
Casinos often use similar tactics to escalate commitment. By offering players club cards that track spending and provide rewards, casinos encourage continued gambling despite losses.

- **Player’s Cards**: Players earn points with every bet, leading to free meals, hotel stays, and other perks. This system encourages gamblers to keep betting to reach the next reward tier, illustrating the escalation of commitment.

#### Study: Sunk Costs in Decision Making
Research by Staw (1976) on "knee-deep in the big muddy" highlights how people and organizations continue to invest in failing projects due to previous investments.

- **Experimental Findings**: Participants were more likely to continue investing in a losing project if they had previously committed resources, demonstrating escalation of commitment.

### Conclusion

Escalation of commitment in a closed-loop system like Dave & Buster’s Power Cards leverages psychological principles such as the sunk cost fallacy, cognitive dissonance, desire for completion, and incremental investment. By understanding these mechanisms, businesses can create strategies that encourage higher spending and repeat visits, thereby enhancing customer retention and increasing overall revenue.
