oh reversible computing is a strictly quantum computing thing?

# Reversible Computing

**Reversible computing** is a paradigm of computation where all operations are logically and physically reversible, meaning that from any computational state, the previous state can be uniquely determined. This concept extends far beyond quantum computing and encompasses classical reversible computation, thermodynamically reversible processes, and fundamental questions about the relationship between computation and physical entropy.

## Mathematical Foundation

A computation is **logically reversible** if the mapping between input and output states is bijective. For a function $f: \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathcal{Y}$, reversibility requires:

$$\forall y \in \text{Range}(f), \exists! x \in \mathcal{X} \text{ such that } f(x) = y$$

This can be formalized using the **inverse function** $f^{-1}: \text{Range}(f) \rightarrow \mathcal{X}$ where:

$$f^{-1}(f(x)) = x \quad \forall x \in \mathcal{X}$$

## Classical Reversible Computing

In classical systems, reversible computing involves [[conservative logic]] where information is never destroyed. The fundamental building blocks include:

### Reversible Logic Gates

- **[[Fredkin gate]]** (controlled-swap): $(a,b,c) \mapsto (a, \bar{a}b \oplus ac, \bar{a}c \oplus ab)$
- **[[Toffoli gate]]** (controlled-controlled-NOT): $(a,b,c) \mapsto (a,b,c \oplus ab)$
- **[[Peres gate]]**: $(a,b,c) \mapsto (a, a \oplus b, ab \oplus c)$

The **universality theorem** for classical reversible computation states that any irreversible boolean function can be embedded in a reversible computation using [[ancillary bits]].

## Thermodynamic Reversibility

[[Landauer's principle]] establishes the connection between logical and physical reversibility:

$$E_{\text{dissipated}} \geq k_B T \ln(2) \cdot N_{\text{erased}}$$

where $N_{\text{erased}}$ represents the number of bits irreversibly erased. **Thermodynamically reversible computing** aims to approach the theoretical minimum energy dissipation by maintaining microscopic reversibility throughout the computation.

## Bennett's Embedding Theorem

For any irreversible function $f: \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}^m$, there exists a reversible embedding:

$$F: \{0,1\}^n \times \{0,1\}^s \rightarrow \{0,1\}^n \times \{0,1\}^m \times \{0,1\}^s$$

defined as:

$$F(x, z) = (x, f(x), z \oplus g(x))$$

where $g(x)$ represents auxiliary information needed for reversibility and $s$ is the number of [[garbage bits]] required.

## Space-Time Tradeoffs

The fundamental tradeoff in reversible computing follows the **Bennett-Roth theorem**:

For a computation requiring space $S$ and time $T$, the reversible version requires:
- **Space**: $S + O(\log S)$
- **Time**: $O(T \cdot \text{polylog}(T))$

This can be expressed symbolically as:

$$\mathcal{R}[f]: (S, T) \mapsto (S + O(\log S), T \cdot \text{polylog}(T))$$

where $\mathcal{R}$ denotes the reversibilization operator.

## Reversible Cellular Automata

[[Reversible cellular automata]] provide a model for massively parallel reversible computation. A cellular automaton is reversible if its global transition function $G: \mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{C}$ is bijective, where $\mathcal{C}$ represents the configuration space.

The **Garden of Eden theorem** for reversible CA states that a configuration is a Garden of Eden if and only if it is not in the image of the global transition function.

## Information-Theoretic Perspective

From an information theory standpoint, reversible computing preserves [[Shannon entropy]]. For a probability distribution $P$ over computational states:

$$H(P_{\text{input}}) = H(P_{\text{output}})$$

The [[mutual information]] between input and output achieves its maximum:

$$I(\text{Input}; \text{Output}) = H(\text{Input}) = H(\text{Output})$$

## Physical Implementations

Classical reversible computing has been explored in various physical substrates:

1. **[[Adiabatic switching]]**: Slow parameter changes to maintain thermodynamic equilibrium
2. **[[Billiard ball computing]]**: Elastic collisions in frictionless mechanical systems  
3. **[[DNA computing]]**: Reversible biochemical reactions
4. **[[Optical computing]]**: Reversible photonic gates using [[linear optics]]

## Relationship to Quantum Computing

While quantum computation is inherently reversible due to the [[unitarity]] of quantum evolution, classical reversible computing provides:

- **Theoretical foundations** for understanding computational reversibility
- **Classical simulation techniques** for quantum algorithms
- **Hybrid classical-quantum** architectures

The [[Solovay-Kitaev theorem]] demonstrates that any unitary operation can be approximated by a finite set of reversible gates, establishing the universality of both classical and quantum reversible computation.

## Complexity Classes

Reversible computation defines distinct complexity classes:

- **RSPACE**: Reversible space-bounded computation
- **RTIME**: Reversible time-bounded computation  
- **RL**: Reversible logarithmic space

The relationship between these classes and their irreversible counterparts remains an active area of research, with implications for fundamental questions about the computational power of reversibility constraints.
