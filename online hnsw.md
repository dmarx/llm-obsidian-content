Online HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) refers to an extension of the HNSW algorithm that supports dynamic updates, allowing for the efficient insertion and deletion of data points without requiring a complete reconstruction of the graph. This capability is particularly useful in applications where the dataset is not static and can change over time, such as in real-time recommendation systems, continuously evolving databases, or streaming data environments.

### Key Concepts

1. **Dynamic Insertion:**
   - **Insertion into the Graph:** When a new data point \( x_{\text{new}} \) is added, it needs to be incorporated into the hierarchical structure across all relevant layers. The insertion process typically follows these steps:
     1. **Selection of the Starting Layer:** The new point is first inserted at the highest level \( l_{\text{max}} \) with some probability, which might depend on the dataset or the specifics of the application.
     2. **Layer-wise Insertion:** The algorithm finds the nearest neighbors in the current layer by traversing the graph. The new point is then connected to the nearest neighbors at that layer, respecting the edge connectivity rules that ensure navigability and efficient search.
     3. **Propagation to Lower Layers:** The process repeats for lower layers until the point is inserted into the base layer, which contains the full dataset.
   - **Maintaining Balance:** The algorithm typically balances the trade-off between the number of connections and the search efficiency by controlling the number of edges per node, often referred to as the "maximum connections" or \( M \) parameter.

2. **Deletion:**
   - **Point Removal:** Deleting a point \( x_{\text{del}} \) involves removing it from all layers where it exists. The primary challenge here is to ensure that the graph remains navigable and efficient for searches after the deletion.
   - **Rewiring the Graph:** When a point is removed, the neighbors of \( x_{\text{del}} \) need to be reconnected to preserve the small-world properties of the graph. This may involve connecting neighbors of the deleted node to each other or to other nearby nodes.

### Algorithmic Details

#### Dynamic Insertion

When a new point \( x_{\text{new}} \) is inserted into the graph:

1. **Layer Assignment:** Determine the highest layer \( l_{\text{new}} \) where \( x_{\text{new}} \) will be added. This is often based on a probabilistic model such as a geometric distribution, where the probability of insertion into higher layers decreases with layer index.

2. **Search and Connect:**
   - **Search:** At layer \( l_{\text{new}} \), perform a local search starting from an existing entry point (often the nearest neighbor from the upper layer). The search follows the standard HNSW search procedure to locate the nearest neighbors of \( x_{\text{new}} \) in that layer.
   - **Connect:** Establish connections between \( x_{\text{new}} \) and its nearest neighbors in layer \( l_{\text{new}} \). The number of connections is typically controlled by a parameter \( M \), ensuring that the graph does not become too dense.

3. **Downward Propagation:** Move down to the next layer \( l_{\text{new}} - 1 \) and repeat the process until the base layer is reached.

#### Dynamic Deletion

When removing a point \( x_{\text{del}} \) from the graph:

1. **Neighbor Reconnection:** Identify all the neighbors of \( x_{\text{del}} \) in each layer. After \( x_{\text{del}} \) is removed, ensure that its neighbors maintain connectivity by creating new edges between them. This step is crucial to preserve the small-world properties of the graph.

2. **Layer-Wise Removal:** Remove the point from all layers it exists in, adjusting connections as described.

### Complexity Considerations

- **Insertion Complexity:** The insertion of a new point involves searching and connecting it across multiple layers. The average time complexity is approximately \( O(\log N) \) for searching the graph at each layer, and the insertion complexity can be considered as \( O(\log^2 N) \) when summed across all layers.
- **Deletion Complexity:** Deletion is slightly more complex due to the need to rewire the graph to maintain connectivity. The complexity depends on the density of the graph and the specific implementation but is generally within \( O(\log^2 N) \) as well.

### Advantages of Online HNSW

- **Efficiency:** Online HNSW supports real-time updates to the dataset, making it ideal for applications where data is continuously added or removed.
- **Scalability:** It maintains the logarithmic search complexity of the original HNSW, ensuring that the search remains efficient even as the dataset grows or evolves.
- **Robustness:** The hierarchical structure and dynamic updating mechanism ensure that the graph remains navigable and efficient, even after numerous insertions and deletions.

### Applications

- **Real-Time Recommendations:** Online HNSW can be used in recommendation engines where new items (e.g., products, media) are continually added, and user preferences change dynamically.
- **Dynamic Databases:** In databases that undergo frequent updates, such as time-series databases, Online HNSW can ensure efficient retrieval of similar records.
- **Continuous Learning Systems:** In machine learning, particularly in settings like online learning or continual learning, where the model or data representation evolves, Online HNSW can serve as a dynamic nearest neighbor module.
