landau levels


**ASSISTANT**

Landau levels are quantized energy levels that arise for charged particles in the presence of a uniform magnetic field. They are a direct consequence of the quantization of cyclotron orbits of a charged particle in the magnetic field. The concept is foundational in [[Quantum Mechanics]] and plays a crucial role in the understanding of [[Quantum Hall Effect|the quantum Hall effect]], magnetoresistance, and other phenomena in condensed matter physics.

## Physical Context

When a charged particle (e.g., an electron) moves in a uniform magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$, it experiences a Lorentz force that causes it to follow a circular trajectory in the plane perpendicular to $\mathbf{B}$. Quantum mechanically, this motion is quantized, leading to discrete energy levels.

### Hamiltonian of the System

The Hamiltonian for a charged particle of charge $q$ and mass $m$ in a magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ is:

$$
H = \frac{1}{2m} \left( \mathbf{p} - q\mathbf{A} \right)^2
$$

where:
- $\mathbf{p}$ is the canonical momentum,
- $\mathbf{A}$ is the vector potential such that $\mathbf{B} = \nabla \times \mathbf{A}$.

For a uniform magnetic field $\mathbf{B} = B\hat{\mathbf{z}}$, one common choice of gauge is the **Landau gauge**:
$$
\mathbf{A} = (-By, 0, 0),
$$
but the **symmetric gauge** $\mathbf{A} = \frac{1}{2} \mathbf{B} \times \mathbf{r}$ is also frequently used.

### Solving the Schrödinger Equation

In the Landau gauge, the Schrödinger equation for the Hamiltonian becomes:

$$
H\psi(x, y, z) = E\psi(x, y, z).
$$

Given the symmetry of the system:
- The motion along the $z$-axis (parallel to $\mathbf{B}$) is free, so the wavefunction in this direction is a plane wave $\psi(z) \sim e^{ik_z z}$.
- The motion in the $x$-$y$ plane is quantized due to the magnetic field.

The eigenfunctions in the $x$-$y$ plane are solutions to a 2D harmonic oscillator, leading to the energy eigenvalues:
$$
E_n = \hbar \omega_c \left( n + \frac{1}{2} \right),
$$
where:
- $n = 0, 1, 2, \dots$ is the **Landau level index**,
- $\omega_c = \frac{|q|B}{m}$ is the **cyclotron frequency**.

### Degeneracy of Landau Levels

The eigenstates corresponding to each Landau level are highly degenerate. This degeneracy arises because the system is translationally invariant along the $x$ and $y$ directions, allowing for many possible quantum states with the same energy. The degeneracy $g$ of each Landau level per unit area is:

$$
g = \frac{|q|B}{h}.
$$

### Key Features

1. **Quantized Energy Levels**: The discrete levels $E_n$ show that the energy of the system is not continuous but quantized.
2. **Macroscopic Degeneracy**: Each Landau level has a degeneracy proportional to the strength of the magnetic field.
3. **Orbital Motion**: The quantum mechanical orbits are localized in the plane perpendicular to $\mathbf{B}$, while free motion occurs along $\mathbf{B}$.

## Applications

1. **Quantum Hall Effect**: Landau levels are central to the formation of the [[Quantum Hall Effect|integer and fractional quantum Hall effects]], where the quantization of Hall conductivity arises from the filling of these levels.
2. **Magneto-optics**: The spacing between Landau levels determines the cyclotron resonance frequency, observable in optical experiments.
3. **Graphene**: In materials like [[Graphene]], the linear dispersion of electrons leads to unconventional Landau levels with energy spacing proportional to $\sqrt{nB}$.

## Extensions

In advanced contexts, such as relativistic systems or those with strong spin-orbit coupling, the structure of Landau levels can be modified. For instance:
- In relativistic systems like graphene, the energy spectrum is given by $E_n \propto \sqrt{nB}$ due to the linear dispersion relation of Dirac electrons.
- Spin interactions or [[Zeeman Effect|Zeeman splitting]] can further lift the degeneracy within each Landau level.

The study of Landau levels provides a bridge between classical cyclotron motion and quantum mechanical behavior, making it a cornerstone of modern condensed matter physics.
