### Robert's Rules of Order

[[Robert's Rules of Order|Robert's Rules]] are a set of guidelines designed to facilitate orderly and efficient meetings and decision-making processes in various types of assemblies. The rules were first codified by Henry Martyn Robert in 1876 and have since undergone multiple revisions to adapt to modern organizational needs. The most current version is the 12th edition, published in 2020.

#### Fundamental Principles

1. **Majority Rule**: Decisions are made by a majority vote to reflect the will of the greater number of participants.
2. **Minority Rights**: The rights of the minority are protected by ensuring they have a voice and opportunities to express their viewpoints.
3. **Equal Consideration**: All members have equal rights, privileges, and obligations, ensuring democratic participation.
4. **Orderly Conduct**: Meetings should be conducted in an orderly manner to allow for efficient and respectful discussion.

#### Key Concepts

1. **Motions**: Formal proposals put forward for discussion and decision. There are several types of motions:
   - **Main Motion**: Introduces a new piece of business or a decision.
   - **Subsidiary Motions**: Modify or affect the main motion (e.g., amend, postpone).
   - **Privileged Motions**: Urgent matters unrelated to the current business (e.g., recess, adjourn).
   - **Incidental Motions**: Questions of procedure arising from other motions (e.g., point of order).

2. **Debate**: Structured discussion on a motion where members can speak for or against it. The rules often limit the number and length of speeches to ensure fairness and efficiency.

3. **Voting**: Various methods of voting can be used, including voice vote, roll call, secret ballot, and more. The specific method depends on the context and the organization's bylaws.

4. **Quorum**: The minimum number of members required to be present to conduct business legally. This number is typically defined in the organization's bylaws.

#### Meeting Structure

1. **Call to Order**: The meeting begins with a formal call to order by the presiding officer.
2. **Approval of Minutes**: The minutes from the previous meeting are reviewed and approved.
3. **Reports**: Officers, boards, and standing committees present their reports.
4. **Unfinished Business**: Any business left over from the previous meeting is addressed.
5. **New Business**: New topics are introduced and discussed.
6. **Adjournment**: The meeting is formally concluded.

#### Practical Application

Robert's Rules of Order are widely used in various types of organizations, including:
- Nonprofit organizations
- Professional societies
- Government bodies
- Corporate boards
- Homeowner associations

Adhering to these rules helps ensure that meetings are conducted in a fair, efficient, and transparent manner, enabling effective decision-making and participation from all members.
