intrinsic dimension


**ASSISTANT**

The intrinsic dimension of a mathematical object, particularly within the context of algebraic geometry, refers to the dimension of the object considered as a space itself, independent of any embedding into a higher-dimensional space. This concept is crucial for understanding the underlying structure of varieties and schemes and for comparing different geometrical or algebraic objects based on their properties rather than their external representations.

### Defining Intrinsic Dimension

In algebraic geometry, the intrinsic dimension of a variety can be defined in several ways, each aligning under general conditions:

1. **Dimension of Coordinate Ring**: The dimension of the [[coordinate [[ring]]]] of a variety, which is the transcendence degree of the field of fractions of the [[ring]] over the base field, can define the dimension of the variety. For an affine variety with [[coordinate [[ring]]]] $R = k[x_1, ..., x_n]/\mathcal{I}(V)$, the dimension is the transcendence degree of the fraction field of $R$ over $k$.

2. **Krull Dimension**: This is a purely algebraic approach where the dimension of a variety is the supremum of the lengths of all chains of prime ideals within its [[coordinate [[ring]]]]. For a variety $V$, this would be the maximum length of chains of prime ideals in $k[x_1, ..., x_n]/\mathcal{I}(V)$.

3. **Topological Dimension**: In the Zariski topology, the dimension can be defined as the maximum number of non-redundant closed subsets in a chain of closures, excluding the empty set. This reflects the depth of the topological structure of the variety.

### Methods to Determine Intrinsic Dimension

- **Jacobian Criterion**: The rank of the Jacobian matrix of the defining polynomials at a general point helps determine the local dimension at that point. By $n - \text{rank}(J)$ where $n$ is the number of variables and $\text{rank}(J)$ is the Jacobian's rank at the point, the dimension of the variety at that point can be estimated.

- **Dimension Theorems**: Various dimension theorems in algebraic geometry, such as the dimension of fibers of a morphism, can help compute or verify the intrinsic dimension of varieties and more complex geometric objects.

### Examples and Applications

- **Curves**: Algebraic curves, whether in $\mathbb{A}^2$ or $\mathbb{P}^2$, have an intrinsic dimension of 1. This includes lines, conics, or more complex curves like elliptic curves, regardless of their embedding.

- **Surfaces**: Objects like a sphere or a torus modeled by equations in three-dimensional space are intrinsically 2-dimensional.

- **Higher Dimensional Varieties**: Varieties defined by more complex sets of equations in higher dimensions, such as Calabi-Yau manifolds in theoretical physics, have higher intrinsic dimensions that are crucial for their geometric and physical properties.

The concept of intrinsic dimension is fundamental in various areas of mathematics and physics, providing insights into the complexity, topology, and geometry of algebraic objects. It enables mathematicians and scientists to analyze objects in a manner that is independent of their contextual or spatial embeddings, focusing solely on their inherent properties.
