### Prospect Theory: An Overview

Prospect Theory, developed by psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in 1979, is a foundational theory in behavioral economics that describes how individuals assess potential losses and gains when making decisions under uncertainty. It represents a significant departure from the classical expected utility theory, which posits that decision makers act rationally and consider all available information to maximize utility. Prospect Theory introduces concepts such as loss aversion, reference dependence, and diminishing sensitivity, providing a more accurate description of how real people make economic decisions.

#### Key Components of Prospect Theory

1. **Reference Dependence**: Decisions are made based on gains and losses relative to a neutral reference point, rather than final outcomes. What constitutes a gain or a loss is determined by this reference point, which is usually the status quo or the individualâ€™s expectations.

2. **Loss Aversion**: This principle posits that losses loom larger than equivalent gains. The displeasure associated with losing a sum of money is typically more intense than the pleasure derived from gaining the same amount. For example, losing $100 feels more significant than the satisfaction of gaining $100.

3. **Diminishing Sensitivity**: This aspect of Prospect Theory suggests that the marginal impact of gains and losses decreases as the amount increases. In other words, the difference in utility between $100 and $200 is more significant than between $1,100 and $1,200, even though both intervals are $100.

4. **Probability Weighting**: Individuals often do not perceive probabilities linearly; they tend to overweight small probabilities and underweight large ones. This behavior leads to irrational decision-making, such as overestimating the likelihood of rare events and underestimating the probability of common occurrences.

#### Stages of Decision Making in Prospect Theory

Prospect Theory's decision-making process can be broken down into two phases:

1. **Editing Phase**: In this initial phase, potential outcomes are ordered according to a reference point. This stage involves simplifying available options, which may include combining, segregating, canceling, or simplifying probabilities.

2. **Evaluation Phase**: During the evaluation phase, the edited prospects are assessed, and the option with the highest utility is chosen. This phase is where the aforementioned characteristics like loss aversion and diminishing sensitivity come into play.

#### Applications of Prospect Theory

- **Economic and Financial Decisions**: Prospect Theory helps explain phenomena such as why people hold onto losing stocks too long (loss aversion) or why they purchase insurance for highly improbable events (probability weighting).
  
- **Public Policy**: Understanding how people perceive gains and losses can help policymakers design more effective policies, such as tax incentives for behavior change or structuring options for public health programs.

- **Marketing**: Marketers use Prospect Theory to craft offers that are framed as gains or to avoid perceptions of loss, enhancing the attractiveness of products and services.

#### Experimental Support and Critiques

Prospect Theory has been validated through various experiments, particularly in the domain of gains, losses, and risk preferences. However, it also faces critiques, particularly regarding the variability in individuals' risk preferences and the challenges of defining a universal reference point.

#### Conclusion

Prospect Theory has had a profound impact on economics, psychology, and beyond by providing a framework that more accurately reflects human behavior in decision-making scenarios involving uncertainty and risk. It challenges the traditional assumptions of rational choice theory and has led to a deeper understanding of human biases and heuristics in economic decisions.
