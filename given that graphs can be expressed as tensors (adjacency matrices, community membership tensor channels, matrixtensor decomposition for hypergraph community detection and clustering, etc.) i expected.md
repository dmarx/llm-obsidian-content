**USER**

given that graphs can be expressed as tensors (adjacency matrices, community membership tensor channels, matrix/tensor decomposition for hypergraph community detection and clustering, etc.) I expected the relationship to be more intimate than you have suggested. at the very least, there should be some subset of cases where tensor contraction has a graph theoretic interpretation as some kind contraction operation over the graph


**ASSISTANT**

You are correct in suggesting that there is a more intimate relationship between tensor contraction and graph operations, especially when considering how graphs can be represented as tensors. Let's delve into some specific cases where tensor contraction directly corresponds to graph-theoretic operations.

### Tensor Representation of Graphs

Graphs can be represented using tensors in various forms, such as adjacency matrices, incidence matrices, and higher-order tensors for hypergraphs or multilayer networks. This allows us to use tensor operations, including tensor contraction, to perform graph operations.

### Adjacency Matrix as a Tensor

The adjacency matrix of a graph $G = (V, E)$ with $n$ vertices is a 2D tensor $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ where $A_{ij} = 1$ if there is an edge between vertices $i$ and $j$, and $A_{ij} = 0$ otherwise.

### Edge Contraction in Adjacency Matrix Form

When we contract an edge $(u, v)$ in a graph, we effectively merge vertices $u$ and $v$. In the adjacency matrix representation, this corresponds to merging the rows and columns corresponding to $u$ and $v$.

### Tensor Contraction as Graph Contraction

Let's explore a specific example of tensor contraction that corresponds to edge contraction in a graph.

#### Example: Edge Contraction Using Adjacency Matrix

Consider a simple graph $G$ with vertices $\{a, b, c\}$ and edges $\{(a, b), (b, c)\}$. The adjacency matrix $A$ is:

$$
A = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
$$

To contract the edge $(a, b)$, we:
1. Merge vertices $a$ and $b$ into a new vertex $d$.
2. The resulting graph $G'$ has vertices $\{d, c\}$.

The new adjacency matrix $A'$ after contraction would involve summing the rows and columns of $a$ and $b$. In tensor terms, this is a form of tensor contraction where we sum over specific indices.

#### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Sum Rows and Columns of $a$ and $b$**:
   - New vertex $d$ will have edges that are the union of edges from $a$ and $b$.
   - For the adjacency matrix, this corresponds to summing rows $a$ and $b$, and columns $a$ and $b$.

$$
A_d = A_a + A_b = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 & 0
\end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 1 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

2. **Form the New Adjacency Matrix**:
   - The new adjacency matrix $A'$ for $G'$ with vertices $\{d, c\}$:
   
$$
A' = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 \\
1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
$$

The new graph $G'$ is a simplified graph with the edge $(d, c)$.

### Generalization to Higher-order Tensors

In more complex graphs, such as those represented by hypergraphs or multilayer networks, the relationship between tensor contraction and graph operations becomes even more significant. Here are a few scenarios where tensor contraction corresponds to graph operations:

1. **Hypergraphs**: Represented by higher-order tensors where vertices and edges can form complex relationships. Contracting edges in hypergraphs corresponds to summing over dimensions in the tensor.

2. **Multilayer Networks**: Represented by a 3D tensor where different layers represent different types of connections or different time steps. Contracting across layers corresponds to summing over the third dimension of the tensor, which can simplify the network by aggregating information across layers.

### Formalizing Tensor Contraction in Graph Theory

Letâ€™s formalize the tensor contraction process in the context of a graph's adjacency matrix:

- Given an adjacency tensor $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ representing a graph $G$, contracting an edge $(i, j)$ corresponds to:
  - Creating a new vertex $k$.
  - Summing rows and columns $i$ and $j$ to form the row and column of $k$.
  
Mathematically, this can be written as:
$$
A'_{kl} = \sum_{m=i,j} A_{ml} \quad \text{for } l \neq i, j
$$
$$
A'_{lk} = \sum_{m=i,j} A_{lm} \quad \text{for } l \neq i, j
$$
$$
A'_{kk} = 0
$$

### Conclusion

By examining specific cases and formalizing the tensor contraction process in the context of graph adjacency matrices, we see that tensor contraction can indeed correspond to graph operations like edge contraction. This relationship is especially useful when dealing with higher-order representations of graphs, such as hypergraphs and multilayer networks, where tensor operations provide a powerful tool for simplifying and analyzing complex structures.
