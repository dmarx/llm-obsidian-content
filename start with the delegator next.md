### **Assignment: Implementing the Delegator Agent Pattern**

In this assignment, students will learn to implement the **Delegator Agent** pattern. This pattern introduces an agent whose responsibility is to delegate tasks to other agents based on their expertise. The **Delegator Agent** doesn't solve tasks directly; instead, it coordinates specialized agents, passing tasks to the appropriate agent and collecting results from them.

### **Objective**:
1. Teach students how to create a **Delegator Agent** that assigns tasks to specialized agents based on their expertise.
2. Demonstrate how to build a system where different agents collaborate by focusing on specific aspects of a problem.
3. Provide students with a practical, multi-agent system that breaks down complex tasks into manageable components.

---

### **Step 1: Defining Specialized Agents**

Before implementing the **Delegator Agent**, we need to define **specialized agents** that handle different types of tasks. Each agent will focus on a specific domain of expertise.

#### **Specialized Agents**:
- **Research Agent**: Handles research-related tasks, providing detailed factual information.
- **Writing Agent**: Focuses on writing and creative tasks, such as storytelling or essay writing.
- **Editor Agent**: Reviews and edits existing text, ensuring clarity and coherence.

Here’s how each specialized agent can be defined using the existing `Agent` class:

```python
class Agent:
    def __init__(self, name, system_prompt_template):
        self.name = name
        self.system_prompt_template = system_prompt_template
        self.history = []  # Initialize conversation history
        # Add the system prompt as the first message in the history
        self.history.append({"role": "system", "content": self.get_system_prompt()})
    
    def get_system_prompt(self):
        """
        Render the system prompt based on the agent's name and personality.
        """
        template = Template(self.system_prompt_template)
        return template.render(name=self.name)
    
    def query_openai(self, user_input, max_tokens=100, temperature=0.7, top_p=1.0, **kwargs):
        """
        Send the conversation history to OpenAI and maintain the chat log.
        """
        # Append the user's input to the history
        self.history.append({"role": "user", "content": user_input})
        
        # Send the conversation history (including system, user, and assistant roles) to the API
        response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
            model="gpt-3.5-turbo",  # Using a chat model that supports roles
            messages=self.history,
            max_tokens=max_tokens,
            temperature=temperature,
            top_p=top_p,
            **kwargs
        )
        
        # Extract the assistant's reply and append it to the history
        assistant_reply = response.choices[0].message["content"]
        self.history.append({"role": "assistant", "content": assistant_reply})
        
        return assistant_reply
    
    def get_history(self):
        """
        Retrieve the conversation history for this agent.
        """
        return [entry for entry in self.history if entry["role"] != "system"]
```

---

### **Step 2: Defining the Delegator Agent**

Now that we have our specialized agents, we can create a **Delegator Agent** whose role is to delegate tasks to these agents based on the nature of the user’s input.

#### **The Delegator Agent’s Responsibilities**:
1. **Task Matching**: Based on the user's input, the delegator decides which agent is best suited to handle the task.
2. **Delegation**: The delegator passes the task to the chosen specialized agent and collects the response.
3. **Combining Responses**: If necessary, the delegator can coordinate multiple agents and combine their responses into a cohesive output.

Here’s how the **Delegator Agent** can be structured:

```python
class DelegatorAgent:
    def __init__(self, agents):
        """
        Initialize the delegator with a set of specialized agents.
        
        Arguments:
        - agents: A dictionary mapping agent names to Agent objects.
        """
        self.agents = agents
    
    def delegate_task(self, user_input, max_tokens=100, temperature=0.7, top_p=1.0):
        """
        Delegate the user's input to the appropriate agent based on the task.
        
        Arguments:
        - user_input: The task or query from the user.
        """
        # Decide which agent to delegate the task to based on the user input
        if "research" in user_input.lower():
            chosen_agent = self.agents.get("ResearchAgent")
            print("Delegating to Research Agent...")
        elif "write" in user_input.lower() or "story" in user_input.lower():
            chosen_agent = self.agents.get("WritingAgent")
            print("Delegating to Writing Agent...")
        elif "edit" in user_input.lower():
            chosen_agent = self.agents.get("EditorAgent")
            print("Delegating to Editor Agent...")
        else:
            return "Sorry, I can't handle that task."
        
        # If the chosen agent exists, delegate the task
        if chosen_agent:
            return chosen_agent.query_openai(user_input, max_tokens=max_tokens, temperature=temperature, top_p=top_p)
        return "Agent not found."
```

---

### **Step 3: Setting Up Specialized Agents**

Now, we’ll create instances of specialized agents for **research**, **writing**, and **editing**. These agents will have specific system prompts that define their roles.

#### **Defining the Specialized Agents**:

```python
# Define system prompts for specialized agents
research_prompt = "You are a research assistant. Provide detailed, factual information."
writing_prompt = "You are a creative writing assistant. Respond with imaginative and creative writing."
editor_prompt = "You are an editor. Review the provided text and suggest improvements."

# Create instances of specialized agents
research_agent = Agent(name="ResearchAgent", system_prompt_template=research_prompt)
writing_agent = Agent(name="WritingAgent", system_prompt_template=writing_prompt)
editor_agent = Agent(name="EditorAgent", system_prompt_template=editor_prompt)

# Create a dictionary to hold the agents
agents = {
    "ResearchAgent": research_agent,
    "WritingAgent": writing_agent,
    "EditorAgent": editor_agent
}

# Create an instance of the delegator agent
delegator_agent = DelegatorAgent(agents=agents)
```

---

### **Step 4: Creating the CLI Interface for the Delegator**

The next step is to create a CLI that allows the user to interact with the **Delegator Agent**. The delegator will analyze the user’s input, choose the appropriate agent, and delegate the task accordingly.

```python
def delegator_cli():
    print("Welcome to the multi-agent system!")
    
    while True:
        # Get user input
        user_input = input("\nEnter your task (type 'exit' to quit): ").strip()
        
        if user_input.lower() == "exit":
            break
        
        # Delegate the task to the appropriate agent
        response = delegator_agent.delegate_task(user_input)
        print(f"Response: {response}")

# Run the CLI
if __name__ == "__main__":
    delegator_cli()
```

---

### **Step 5: Running the CLI and Observing Agent Delegation**

When the user inputs a query, the **Delegator Agent** will analyze the query, select the appropriate agent based on keywords, and pass the task to that agent. The specialized agent will then handle the task and provide the response.

#### **Example Interaction**:

```bash
Welcome to the multi-agent system!

Enter your task (type 'exit' to quit): research the theory of relativity
Delegating to Research Agent...
Response: The theory of relativity, developed by Albert Einstein, refers to two interrelated theories: special relativity and general relativity...

Enter your task (type 'exit' to quit): write a short story about a hero
Delegating to Writing Agent...
Response: Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived a hero who was known for his bravery and kindness...

Enter your task (type 'exit' to quit): edit the following sentence: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
Delegating to Editor Agent...
Response: The sentence is grammatically correct. You could improve it by adding more descriptive details, such as: "The agile, quick brown fox swiftly jumps over the sluggish, lazy dog."

Enter your task (type 'exit' to quit): exit
```

### **Explanation**:

1. **Delegator Functionality**:
   - Based on keywords like "research", "write", or "edit", the **Delegator Agent** assigns the task to the appropriate agent.
   - Each agent provides a response that is consistent with its domain of expertise.

2. **Specialization**:
   - The **Research Agent** provides factual information.
   - The **Writing Agent** focuses on creative writing tasks.
   - The **Editor Agent** reviews and improves the text.

---

### **Step 6: Extending the Delegator Pattern**

Students can extend this pattern by adding more specialized agents for different domains, such as:
- **Math Agent**: Handles mathematical problems and calculations.
- **Design Agent**: Provides feedback on UI/UX design or graphical content.
- **Code Review Agent**: Specializes in reviewing and improving code.

To implement these, students can:
1. Create new agents with unique system prompts.
2. Add them to the **Delegator Agent**'s delegation logic.

---

### **Learning Outcomes**:

1. **Agent Specialization**: Students will understand how to create specialized agents, each with its own system prompt and domain of expertise.
2. **Delegation of Tasks**: Students will learn how to delegate tasks to the appropriate agent based on the nature of the user’s input.
