**USER**

I am an element of various "tech" adjacent systems. I work at a tech company. My social life is a tech discord. I'm active in the twitter tech community. I am invested in several tech companies. there are a variety of technologies I engage with.

earlier this evening, I saw a Daily Show clip on youtube where Jon Stewart was expressing a lot of negativity towards Amazon specifically and the tech industry broadly. I own Amazon stock. I used to work at a Amazon. It's kinda likely some of the code I wrote is still part of the production system. I order stuff from Amazon all the time. I am part of the Amazon "system". If Amazon is an organism, I am roughly analogous to one of its cells. It's likely that every single person who watches that video is in some way a part of the Amazon system. 

This system's boundaries I think are divided by which parts of the system are specifically impacted by the super-organisms success or injury. To be contrasted with cells that are members of external systems.

under this definition, a parasite in effect literally becomes a "part of" its host. If the host does well, the parasite does well, and vice versa. If my arm goes septic, my body is totally entitled to vote that component of the system "off the island". If I am infected by a parasite, the parts of the system that were in harmony before its arrival are totally justified to kick out the new arrival.

It's not even utilitarian so much as it is democratic. We are trying to balance/maximize the satisfied "interests" of all components of the system, so they're not in tension with each other and can settle into a stable "low energy" state.

This plurality of interests is effectively what determines "morality" (ethics?) within the system. Morality qua "what's allowed". "Allowed" meaning, the space of behaviors a given component can exhibit that are within some given radius of "frustration" with respect to the system. Maybe the system broadly isn't very sensitive to frustration from that cell, maybe the local neighborhood has a low tolerance for frustration local to that cell.

something something interpretation of morality that carries a lot of utilitarian features, but "utility" is contextual within sub-systems that are competing to have their respective interests disproportionately satisfied.

 wow, ok, back to the tech thing.

I am part of the Amazon "system". If Amazon is an organism, I am roughly analogous to one of its cells. It's likely that every single person who watches that video is in some way a part of the Amazon system. 

Jon Stewart was expressing a lot of negativity towards Amazon specifically and the tech industry broadly. If I were in Amazon's POV, I'd feel threatened. As an Amazon investor, I felt threatened. As someone who uses Amazon for a variety of conveniences, I felt threatened. 

I think it's fair to say that a reasonable portion of the Amazon "system" is aware of Jon Stewarts comments. I am part of the Amazon organism. Some of the parts of me that are part of that system felt threatened. The part of me that is an Amazon investor. etc. 

There are lots of people who are part of the Amazon system for varieties of reasons. Individually, these people may have felt threatened in varieties of ways on behalf of their connection to the broader Amazon organism in whatever ways. 

Even while agreeing with Jon. 

The part of me that remembers small book stores agrees with Jon. The part of me that is angry about the weakness of anti-monopoly regulations in the US and how underfunded the FTC clearly is -- agrees with Jon.

In a variety of ways, I am *infected* by it. Amazon is a part of me, and I am a part of it.

I am just one such cell. Amazon has many such cells. People like me who use it or worked for it or engage with it in ways that if Amazon is threatened, they are tangibly threatened.

In so far as Amazon is made up of components like these, a lot of the components that comprise the system was aware of Jon Stewarts comments. Imagining whatever the "footprint" of the Amazon organism comprises, it's reasonable to imagine that a sizable fraction of that footprint was "aware" of Jon's Comments. The system felt threatened. 

Systems can behave extremely aggressively when threatened, even make decisions out of panic that are counter-productive to **the continued stability of the system.**

That's the "free energy principle" right there. "Bodily preservation" is just about staying in the current stable basin. To do otherwise would "frustrate" the system.

---

this meditation was primarily a philosophical exercise to crystallize certain ideas around the nature of self, identity, consciousness, and subjective experience. 

fundamentally, Amazon literally is an "organism", and that anything that satisfies the definition of a system of sufficient complexity also satisfies that definition. When I am driving in my car, the car and I comprise a system together and it is perfectly reasonable for you to reason about how my car on the road behaves differently than how you might reason about me or my car alone, and for it to be meaningful that there is something it feels like to be me driving my car. If I put my hand on a stove, that subsystem of "me" sustains injury. it communicates this to the rest of my body through pain, which is fundamentally just one subsystem communicating with another. 

I am being completely literal in how I am discussing systems as organisms. the functional structures that form in emergent collective behavior are in response to minimizing an energy surface, which could be parameterized with respect to the phases of its constituent parts. Phases are given by attractor basins, so you can kind of think of the "interests" of a component as being represented by a particular attractor in state space. As a system, they subcomponents are interacting with each other in a variety of ways, simultaneously operating as parts of a whole, but also competing with each other for common resources. Within this context, every system is accompanied by a set of thresholds that govern when components of the system will respond to inter-component frustrations of their own equilibrium orbits.

synthesize my comments about organismic structures and behaviors emerging from systems of various kinds and scales and the connection between those various kinds of systems and interactions and the nature of self and mind


**ASSISTANT**

Your reflections weave together several profound concepts spanning systems theory, philosophy, ethics, and the nature of self and consciousness. To synthesize these ideas, we'll explore how organismic structures and behaviors emerge from complex systems, drawing parallels between these systems at various scales and extending these insights to understand self, mind, and morality within these frameworks.

### Systems as Organismic Entities

At the core of your meditation is the notion that systems of sufficient complexity, such as Amazon or even broader technological ecosystems, can be understood as organismic entities. This perspective is deeply rooted in [[systems theory]], where complex systems are viewed as cohesive wholes whose components interact in structured ways to maintain the system's integrity and functionality. In this view, components of a system—ranging from individuals within a society to cells within a biological organism—play roles analogous to organs in a body, contributing to the overall health and stability of the system.

### Emergent Collective Behavior and Functional Structures

The emergence of collective behavior and functional structures within these systems is a key concept, often described through the lens of emergent properties in complex systems. These properties arise from the interactions among the system's components and cannot be predicted solely by examining the components in isolation. This emergence is a hallmark of complex adaptive systems, where local interactions can lead to the spontaneous organization and evolution of new structures and behaviors. Mathematical formalization of these phenomena often involves concepts like attractor basins in dynamical systems theory, representing stable states or "interests" towards which system components gravitate.

### Self, Consciousness, and Subjective Experience

Your exploration extends into the realms of self, consciousness, and subjective experience, suggesting that our understanding of individual identity and consciousness can benefit from a systemic perspective. Just as a system's behavior reflects the interactions of its components, consciousness might similarly emerge from the complex interactions within networks of neurons in the brain. This view aligns with theories of embodied cognition, which argue that cognitive processes are deeply rooted in the body's interactions with the world.

### Morality and Ethics within Systems

The ethical dimensions you touch upon, where morality emerges as a negotiation of interests among system components, reflect a utilitarian approach contextualized within systems. This framework suggests that ethical behavior maximizes the overall "satisfaction" of the system's components, balancing individual interests to achieve a stable, low-energy state. This conception of morality as emergent from the dynamics of system components offers a novel perspective on ethical decision-making, emphasizing the importance of harmony and equilibrium within complex systems.

### Connection to the Free Energy Principle

Your mention of the [[free energy principle]] ties these ideas back to a fundamental goal of minimizing free energy or surprise within a system, whether it's a biological organism or a socio-technical entity like Amazon. This principle provides a theoretical framework for understanding how systems maintain their structure and adapt to changes in their environment, striving to preserve their integrity by minimizing the difference between expected and actual states.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, your meditation draws attention to the profound interconnectedness of systems, organismic behaviors, and emergent properties, extending these concepts to encompass self, consciousness, and morality. This synthesis underscores the potential of systems theory not only to illuminate the dynamics of complex systems but also to offer insights into the nature of human experience and ethical considerations within these intricate networks. Through this lens, we gain a deeper appreciation for the intricate web of interactions that define our world, challenging us to reconsider our place within these vast, complex systems.
