Wardrop’s first principle

**Wardrop's First Principle**

### Definition
Wardrop's First Principle, also known as the **Principle of User Equilibrium**, states that traffic will distribute itself across a transportation network such that no individual driver can reduce their travel time by switching routes. In equilibrium, all routes used between a given origin and destination have equal and minimal travel times, while unused routes have equal or greater travel times.

### Mathematical Formulation
Wardrop's First Principle can be formalized using the concept of equilibrium in traffic flow. Consider a network with a set of origins \( O \) and destinations \( D \), and let \( r \) represent a specific origin-destination pair. The set of possible routes connecting \( r \) is denoted by \( R_r \). The flow on route \( k \in R_r \) is \( f_k \), and the travel time on route \( k \) is \( t_k(f) \), which is a function of the flow.

The principle can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
t_k(f) \leq t_j(f) \quad \forall j \in R_r, \quad \forall k \in R_r \text{ with } f_k > 0
$$

This states that for any route \( k \) with positive flow, the travel time \( t_k \) must be less than or equal to the travel time \( t_j \) for any other route \( j \).

### Conditions and Assumptions
- **Non-Negative Flows:** \( f_k \geq 0 \)
- **Flow Conservation:** For each origin-destination pair \( r \), the total flow on all routes connecting \( r \) equals the demand \( d_r \):

  $$
  \sum_{k \in R_r} f_k = d_r
  $$

- **Travel Time Functions:** Travel times are typically increasing functions of flow, reflecting congestion effects.

### Example
Consider a simple network with two routes (A and B) between an origin and a destination. If route A has a travel time function \( t_A(f_A) = 10 + 0.5f_A \) and route B has \( t_B(f_B) = 15 + 0.2f_B \), the equilibrium condition requires that:

$$
t_A(f_A) = t_B(f_B)
$$

Let’s assume the total demand is 10 units. At equilibrium, we solve:

$$
10 + 0.5f_A = 15 + 0.2(10 - f_A)
$$

Solving for \( f_A \):

$$
10 + 0.5f_A = 15 + 2 - 0.2f_A
$$

$$
0.7f_A = 7
$$

$$
f_A = 10
$$

Thus, \( f_A = 10 \) and \( f_B = 0 \), meaning all traffic will use route A in this example.

### Implications and Applications
Wardrop's First Principle is foundational in the field of [[transportation planning]] and traffic engineering. It is used to model and predict traffic patterns, evaluate the impact of infrastructure changes, and optimize traffic flow in urban networks.

- **Route Choice Models:** The principle underlies many route choice models, such as the [[User Equilibrium Model]] and the [[Stochastic User Equilibrium]].
- **Network Design:** It helps in designing efficient transportation networks by predicting how changes (e.g., new roads or traffic regulations) will affect overall travel times and distributions.
- **Congestion Pricing:** Implementing strategies like congestion pricing can alter the cost functions, thereby influencing the equilibrium state to achieve more desirable traffic distributions.

### Numerical Methods
To solve for user equilibrium in large networks, iterative algorithms like the Frank-Wolfe algorithm are commonly used. These methods iteratively adjust route flows until the equilibrium condition is met.

### Conclusion
Wardrop's First Principle provides a theoretical foundation for understanding and predicting traffic flow patterns in a transportation network. By ensuring that no driver can unilaterally reduce their travel time, it helps achieve an equilibrium state where travel times are optimized across the network.
