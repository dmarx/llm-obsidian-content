Belbin's "Coordinator" team role


**ASSISTANT**

The "Coordinator" is one of the nine team roles identified by Meredith Belbin in his Team Roles model. Coordinators are essential for focusing on the team's objectives and for delegating work appropriately across the team. They often take on the role of a chairperson, guiding the team through organized processes and ensuring effective communication among team members.

### Characteristics of the Coordinator

**Strengths**: Coordinators are typically excellent listeners and are skilled at clarifying goals, promoting decision-making, and delegating tasks effectively. They are often perceived as confident, stable, and mature, and usually have a natural ability to recognize the value of each team member, making use of their strengths to achieve team goals.

**Behavioral Traits**:
- Coordinators are often very good at establishing clear objectives and helping everyone stay focused on the task at hand.
- They tend to be good at stepping back from the details, seeing the big picture, and recognizing what needs to be done to move forward.
- They excel in fostering cooperation within the team and often manage conflicts well by addressing issues openly.

### Contributions to the Team

1. **Facilitating Interaction**: Coordinators are adept at encouraging open dialogue and ensuring that all team members have an opportunity to contribute to discussions. They make sure that every voice is heard.
2. **Clarifying Goals**: They keep the team focused on the objectives and help align the efforts of different team members with these goals.
3. **Delegating Tasks**: Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each team member allows Coordinators to assign tasks effectively, ensuring that work is completed efficiently.

### Allowable Weaknesses

While Coordinators are key to the success of many teams, they also have some potential weaknesses:
- **Can Be Seen as Manipulative**: Sometimes, their skill in delegating tasks might be perceived as manipulation or as shirking their own share of the work.
- **Indecisiveness**: In some cases, they might struggle to make decisions by themselves without consulting others, which can slow down the team's progress.

### Managing a Coordinator

To ensure that Coordinators are most effective in their role, consider the following:
- Provide them with clear, concise, and comprehensive information so they can make informed decisions.
- Encourage them to develop direct involvement in some tasks to complement their natural delegating style.
- Support them in developing their decision-making skills to avoid potential bottlenecks in team progress.

### Ideal Scenarios for Coordinators

Coordinators excel in environments where strong leadership is needed to manage diverse teams. They are particularly effective in managerial or supervisory roles where planning and resource allocation are critical. Their ability to harness team strengths and direct collective efforts towards a common goal makes them invaluable in project management, consultancy, and any team-oriented leadership role.

In summary, the Coordinator role in Belbinâ€™s model is crucial for ensuring that teams work collaboratively, stay focused on their goals, and operate efficiently. Their ability to manage people and resources effectively can significantly enhance the performance and cohesion of any team.
