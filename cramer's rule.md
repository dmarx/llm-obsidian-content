**USER**

Cramer's Rule


**ASSISTANT**

**Cramer's Rule** is a theorem in linear algebra that provides a method for solving systems of linear equations with as many equations as unknowns, assuming that the system has a unique solution. This rule is particularly useful when the system is small and can be computed by hand, as it gives an explicit formula for the solution in terms of the [[determinants]] of matrices.

### Statement of Cramer's Rule

Cramer's Rule applies to a system of linear equations of the form:
$$
Ax = b
$$
where
- \( A \) is an \( n \times n \) square matrix,
- \( x \) is a column vector of unknowns \([x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n]^T\),
- \( b \) is a column vector of constants \([b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n]^T\).

The rule states that if the determinant of \( A \) (denoted as \( \det(A) \)) is non-zero (which implies that \( A \) is invertible and the system has a unique solution), then each unknown \( x_i \) can be found using the formula:
$$
x_i = \frac{\det(A_i)}{\det(A)}
$$
where \( A_i \) is the matrix formed by replacing the \( i \)-th column of \( A \) with the vector \( b \).

### Example

Consider the system of equations:
$$
\begin{align*}
a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 &= b_1 \\
a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 &= b_2
\end{align*}
$$
The matrix form is:
$$
A = \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} \end{bmatrix}, \quad b = \begin{bmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2 \end{bmatrix}
$$
The solution using Cramer's Rule would be:
$$
x_1 = \frac{\det \begin{bmatrix} b_1 & a_{12} \\ b_2 & a_{22} \end{bmatrix}}{\det \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} \end{bmatrix}}, \quad x_2 = \frac{\det \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & b_1 \\ a_{21} & b_2 \end{bmatrix}}{\det \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} \end{bmatrix}}
$$

### Geometric Interpretation

Geometrically, each \( \det(A_i) \) represents the volume of a parallelepiped in \( n \)-dimensional space, formed by replacing one of the basis vectors of \( A \) by \( b \). The ratio of \( \det(A_i) \) to \( \det(A) \) reflects how the substitution of \( b \) in the place of the \( i \)-th column vector of \( A \) changes the volume defined by the columns of \( A \).

### Applications and Limitations

- **Applications**: Cramer's Rule is used for small systems where determinant calculations are manageable. It’s particularly useful in theoretical work to derive expressions dependent on system parameters, and in computer graphics and other computations where systems are small and require exact solutions.

- **Limitations**:
  - Computationally Inefficient: For large systems, the calculation of [[determinants]] via Cramer’s Rule becomes computationally expensive and numerically unstable compared to other methods such as Gaussian elimination or iterative methods.
  - Applicability: It only applies to square systems where the determinant of \( A \) is non-zero. 

Despite its computational limitations for large systems, Cramer's Rule remains a valuable tool for understanding and teaching linear algebra, providing a direct algebraic solution to linear systems and illustrating the significance of [[determinants]] in solving linear equations.
