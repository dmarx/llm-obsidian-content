Functional Central Limit Theorems


**ASSISTANT**

Functional Central Limit Theorems (FCLTs) are extensions of the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) to the setting of stochastic processes. Instead of considering the convergence of finite-dimensional distributions, FCLTs deal with the convergence of entire sequences of random functions to a limiting process, often a Gaussian process. 

### Key Results and Concepts in FCLTs

#### 1. **Donsker’s Invariance Principle**

**Statement**:
Let $\{X_i\}_{i=1}^n$ be a sequence of i.i.d. random variables with mean 0 and variance 1. Define the empirical process:
$$ S_n(t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \sum_{i=1}^{\lfloor nt \rfloor} X_i, \quad t \in [0,1]. $$
As $n \to \infty$, the process $\{S_n(t)\}_{t \in [0,1]}$ converges in distribution to a standard Brownian motion $W(t)$:
$$ S_n(t) \rightsquiggle W(t) \quad \text{in} \quad D([0,1]), $$
where $D([0,1])$ denotes the space of càdlàg (right-continuous with left limits) functions on $[0,1]$.

**Importance**:
This result, also known as Donsker’s Theorem, is fundamental in [[empirical process theory]]. It shows that normalized partial sum processes converge to Brownian motion, providing a basis for many applications in statistics and econometrics.

#### 2. **Multivariate Functional Central Limit Theorem**

**Statement**:
Let $\{X_i\}_{i=1}^n$ be i.i.d. random vectors in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with mean vector 0 and covariance matrix $\Sigma$. Define the multivariate empirical process:
$$ S_n(t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \sum_{i=1}^{\lfloor nt \rfloor} X_i, \quad t \in [0,1]. $$
Then, $\{S_n(t)\}_{t \in [0,1]}$ converges in distribution to a multivariate Brownian motion $\{W(t)\}_{t \in [0,1]}$ with mean vector 0 and covariance function $E[W(t)W(s)'] = \min(t,s)\Sigma$:
$$ S_n(t) \rightsquiggle W(t) \quad \text{in} \quad D([0,1], \mathbb{R}^d). $$

**Importance**:
This multivariate extension of Donsker’s Theorem is crucial for handling high-dimensional data and multivariate time series, where joint convergence of multiple components is studied.

#### 3. **Empirical Process FCLT**

**Statement**:
Let $\{X_i\}_{i=1}^n$ be i.i.d. random variables with distribution $P$. Consider the empirical process:
$$ \mathbb{G}_n(f) = \sqrt{n}(P_n(f) - P(f)), $$
where $P_n$ is the empirical measure and $f$ ranges over a class of functions $\mathcal{F}$ with bounded complexity (e.g., satisfying certain entropy conditions). Then,
$$ \mathbb{G}_n \rightsquiggle \mathbb{G} \quad \text{in} \quad l^\infty(\mathcal{F}), $$
where $\mathbb{G}$ is a Gaussian process with covariance function $E[\mathbb{G}(f)\mathbb{G}(g)] = \text{Cov}(f(X), g(X))$.

**Importance**:
This result extends the classical CLT to empirical processes, providing a framework for uniform convergence over classes of functions. It's essential for developing asymptotic theory in nonparametric statistics and machine learning.

#### 4. **Invariance Principle for Partial-Sum Processes**

**Statement**:
Let $\{X_i\}_{i=1}^n$ be a stationary sequence of random variables with mean 0 and suitable mixing conditions. Define the partial sum process:
$$ S_n(t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \sum_{i=1}^{\lfloor nt \rfloor} X_i. $$
Under appropriate conditions, $S_n(t)$ converges in distribution to a Brownian motion with a certain variance:
$$ S_n(t) \rightsquiggle \sigma W(t) \quad \text{in} \quad D([0,1]), $$
where $\sigma^2$ is the long-run variance of the sequence.

**Importance**:
This result generalizes the FCLT to dependent sequences, which is important for time series analysis and econometric applications where data points are often not independent.

### Applications and Examples

#### Example 1: **Uniform Empirical Process**

For a sequence of i.i.d. uniform $[0,1]$ random variables $U_1, U_2, \ldots, U_n$, the empirical distribution function $F_n(x)$ converges to the true distribution function $F(x) = x$ uniformly. The corresponding empirical process $\mathbb{G}_n(x) = \sqrt{n}(F_n(x) - x)$ converges to a Brownian bridge $B(x)$:
$$ \mathbb{G}_n \rightsquiggle B \quad \text{in} \quad l^\infty([0,1]). $$

#### Example 2: **Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test**

The Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic is based on the supremum of the empirical process:
$$ D_n = \sup_x |\mathbb{G}_n(x)|. $$
Under the null hypothesis, $D_n$ converges in distribution to the supremum of a Brownian bridge:
$$ D_n \rightsquiggle \sup_{0 \leq t \leq 1} |B(t)|. $$
