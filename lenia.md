### Lenia

Lenia is a computational model and a generalization of Conway's Game of Life, designed to simulate artificial life forms. Created by Bert Wang-Chak Chan, Lenia extends the basic concepts of [[cellular automata]] to continuous domains and uses more complex and smooth transition functions. This allows for the creation of more intricate and lifelike patterns, often resembling biological organisms.

#### Core Concepts of Lenia

1. **State Space**: Unlike the Game of Life, which has discrete states (usually just two: alive or dead), Lenia operates with continuous states. Each cell in Lenia has a state value ranging continuously, typically between 0 and 1, representing different levels of existence or activity.

2. **Neighborhood and Kernel**: Lenia uses a defined neighborhood around each cell, similar to [[cellular automata]], but it includes a convolution kernel which is applied over the neighborhood. This kernel determines how the states of neighboring cells affect the central cell, generally being a smooth, often Gaussian-like function. This smoothing effect is key to Lenia's ability to simulate more fluid and organic forms.

3. **Update Rules**: The update function in Lenia is based on the convolution of the neighborhood with the kernel, followed by the application of a growth function. This growth function dictates how the state of a cell changes based on the convolution result. It typically involves thresholds that determine whether a cell's state increases, decreases, or remains stable, contributing to the formation and maintenance of complex patterns.

#### Behavior and Patterns

Lenia is known for its diverse and complex behaviors, which can mimic biological phenomena:
- **Morphogenesis**: Patterns in Lenia can self-organize into stable, oscillating, or chaotic structures that resemble biological organisms, including structures that mimic the movements and behaviors of single-celled organisms.
- **Diversity of Life Forms**: Lenia supports a wide variety of life forms, or "species," each defined by specific parameters of the kernel and growth function. These species can exhibit different behaviors, such as locomotion, replication, and interaction with other patterns.

#### Mathematical and Computational Aspects

- **Continuous Dynamics**: Lenia's continuous nature requires handling real numbers and potentially small changes in state, which demands higher precision in computation compared to traditional [[cellular automata]].
- **Parameter Space Exploration**: The behavior of patterns in Lenia is highly sensitive to the parameters defining the kernel and growth function. Exploring this parameter space to find stable or interesting behaviors is a complex task, often involving automated search techniques like genetic algorithms.

#### Applications and Implications

- **Artificial Life and Biology**: Lenia provides a rich platform for exploring concepts of artificial life, offering insights into how simple mathematical rules can give rise to lifelike behaviors and complex adaptive systems.
- **Education and Research**: It serves as an advanced tool for teaching and researching dynamic systems, complexity, and emergent phenomena.
- **Creative and Artistic Expressions**: Lenia has also been used in digital art and visualizations, where its aesthetically pleasing and intricate patterns serve as a source of creative inspiration.

Lenia represents a significant evolution in the field of [[cellular automata]], pushing the boundaries of what can be simulated and explored within a computational framework. Its ability to simulate life-like, dynamic behaviors that are visually and conceptually closer to real biological systems makes it a fascinating subject of study in both scientific and artistic communities.
