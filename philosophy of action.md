# Philosophy of Action

[[Philosophy of action]] is a branch of philosophy concerned with the nature of human [[agency]], [[intentionality]], and the fundamental character of actions as distinct from other types of events. It explores the conceptual, metaphysical, normative, and epistemological dimensions of what it means to act and be an agent.

## Conceptual Foundations

### Action vs. Happening

A central distinction in the philosophy of action is between:

- **Actions**: Events attributable to agents that involve some form of agency
- **Mere happenings**: Events that merely occur to or around agents

This can be formalized as:

$$E = A \cup H \quad \text{where} \quad A \cap H = \emptyset$$

Where:
- $E$ is the set of all events
- $A$ is the subset of actions
- $H$ is the subset of mere happenings

### Basic vs. Non-Basic Actions

[[Basic actions]] (Goldman, 1970) are those performed directly, not by performing any other action:

$$\text{Basic}(a) \iff \neg\exists b (a \text{ by } b)$$

Where "a by b" indicates that action a is performed by performing action b.

## Causal Theories of Action

[[Causal theories]] (Davidson, 1963; Goldman, 1970) hold that what distinguishes actions from mere happenings is their causal history:

$$A(e) \iff \exists r,i \text{ such that } (r \land i) \to e$$

Where:
- $A(e)$ means e is an action
- $r$ represents the agent's reasons
- $i$ represents the agent's intentions
- $\to$ represents the appropriate causal relation

### The Standard Causal Model

The standard model proposes:

$$\text{Action} = \langle B, I, M, E \rangle$$

Where:
- $B$ is a set of beliefs
- $I$ is a set of desires/intentions
- $M$ is the mediating causal mechanism
- $E$ is the resulting bodily movement or event

## Intention and Intentional Action

### Multiple Senses of Intention

Anscombe (1957) distinguished three senses of intention:
1. Intention-with-which: The purpose for which an action is performed
2. Intention-to: The prospective plan to perform an action
3. Intentional action: The characterization of an action as done intentionally

Formally, we can represent these as different operators:
- $\text{IntentionWith}(a, g)$: Action a is performed with goal g
- $\text{IntentionTo}(a, t)$: Agent intends to do a at time t
- $\text{Intentional}(a)$: Action a is performed intentionally

### Relation Between Intention and Belief

According to [[cognitivism]] about intention:

$$\text{Intend}(A) \to \text{Believe}(P_A > 0)$$

Where $P_A$ represents the subjective probability of successfully performing A.

## The Problem of Action Individuation

The [[problem of action individuation]] concerns how to count and distinguish actions:

$$a_1 = a_2 \iff \forall P(P(a_1) \leftrightarrow P(a_2))$$

This formulation entails that actions are identical if and only if they have all the same properties, following [[Leibniz's Law]].

### Fine-Grained vs. Coarse-Grained Views

- **Fine-grained view** (Goldman): Actions are individuated by their properties, generating many distinct actions
- **Coarse-grained view** (Davidson): Actions are identical to their bodily movements, allowing fewer distinctions

## Free Will and Determinism

The [[free will]] debate addresses whether actions can be both caused and free:

$$\text{Free}(a) \stackrel{?}{\iff} \neg\text{Determined}(a)$$

### Compatibilism

[[Compatibilism]] (e.g., Frankfurt, 1971) holds:

$$\text{Free}(a) \iff \text{Agent could have done otherwise} \lor \text{Agent identifies with the causes of } a$$

### Libertarianism

[[Libertarianism]] about free will holds:

$$\text{Free}(a) \iff \text{Agent is the uncaused cause of } a$$

### Determinism

[[Determinism]] holds:

$$\forall e \exists C(C \text{ causally sufficient for } e)$$

## Practical Reasoning and Rationality

### Practical Syllogism

The [[practical syllogism]] model of practical reasoning:

$$\begin{align}
\text{Desire}(E) \\
\text{Believe}(\text{Doing } A \text{ causes } E) \\
\hline
\therefore \text{Do}(A)
\end{align}$$

### Practical Rationality

[[Practical rationality]] can be formalized as:

$$\text{Rational}(a) \iff a = \arg\max_{a' \in A} \sum_{s \in S} P(s|a') \cdot U(s)$$

Where:
- $A$ is the set of available actions
- $S$ is the set of possible outcomes
- $P(s|a')$ is the probability of outcome s given action a'
- $U(s)$ is the utility of outcome s

## Agency and Causation

### Causal Theory of Agency

The [[causal theory of agency]] (CTA) holds:

$$\text{Agent causes } e \iff \exists s(s \text{ is a state of the agent} \land s \text{ causes } e)$$

### Agent Causation

[[Agent causation]] theories (e.g., Reid, Chisholm) posit:

$$\text{Agent causes } e \not\equiv \exists s(s \text{ is a state of the agent} \land s \text{ causes } e)$$

That is, agent causation is irreducible to event causation.

## Collective and Shared Agency

### Joint Action

[[Joint action]] involves multiple agents acting together:

$$\text{Joint}(a) \iff \exists x_1,...,x_n(\text{Agents}(x_1,...,x_n) \land \text{Perform}(x_1,...,x_n, a) \land \text{JointIntention}(x_1,...,x_n, a))$$

### We-Intentions

[[We-intentions]] (Searle, 1990; Tuomela, 2007) represent collective intentionality:

$$\text{We-intend}(G, a) \not\equiv \forall x \in G: \text{I-intend}(x, a)$$

## Contemporary Approaches

### The Standard Story and Its Critics

The "Standard Story" of action holds that actions are bodily movements caused by beliefs and desires. Critics argue:

$$\text{Action} \neq \text{Bodily Movement} + \text{Mental Causation}$$

### Embodied Agency

[[Embodied agency]] views emphasize the role of the body:

$$\text{Agency} = f(\text{Body}, \text{Environment}, \text{Mental States})$$

### Narrative Approaches

[[Narrative approaches]] (e.g., MacIntyre) understand actions within life stories:

$$\text{Action Meaning} = g(\text{Narrative Context}, \text{Life History}, \text{Future Projects})$$

## Interdisciplinary Connections

### Cognitive Science

[[Cognitive science]] investigates the mechanisms underlying action:

$$\text{Action Production} = h(\text{Perception}, \text{Attention}, \text{Motor Control}, \text{Executive Function})$$

### Neuroscience of Action

[[Neuroscience]] examines neural correlates of action and intention:

$$\text{Neural Basis} = \{\text{SMA}, \text{PFC}, \text{BG}, \text{M1}, \text{PMC}\}$$

Where these abbreviations represent brain regions involved in action planning and execution.

### Artificial Intelligence

[[AI]] research addresses how to create artificial agents capable of purposeful action:

$$\text{Artificial Agency} = \langle \text{Perception}, \text{Planning}, \text{Decision}, \text{Execution} \rangle$$

## Research Frontiers

Current research explores:
- [[Extended agency]] in human-technology systems
- The role of [[consciousness]] in action
- [[Skilled action]] and its relation to explicit knowledge
- The development of [[agency]] in childhood
- [[Social dimensions]] of action and practical reasoning

## Key Philosophical Tensions

The field contains several unresolved tensions:
- [[Causalism]] vs. [[non-causalism]] about action explanation
- [[Internalism]] vs. [[externalism]] about reasons
- [[Reductionism]] vs. [[non-reductionism]] about agency
- [[Intellectualism]] vs. [[anti-intellectualism]] about skilled action
- [[Individualism]] vs. [[collectivism]] about social action
