### Cromwell’s Rule

Cromwell’s Rule is an important principle in Bayesian probability and decision theory that advises against assigning a prior probability of zero to any hypothesis unless it is logically impossible. The rule is named after the English military and political leader Oliver Cromwell, who, in a letter to the Church of Scotland, implored them to "think it possible that you may be mistaken."

#### 1. **Conceptual Foundation**

- **Bayesian Framework**: In the Bayesian framework, prior probabilities represent initial degrees of belief in hypotheses before considering new evidence. These priors are updated to posterior probabilities using Bayes' theorem as new evidence is encountered.

  $$ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} $$

- **Non-Zero Priors**: Cromwell’s Rule emphasizes that priors should not be set to zero unless the hypothesis is logically impossible because a prior of zero means the hypothesis can never be updated to a non-zero posterior probability, regardless of the evidence.

  - **Example**: Assigning a prior probability of zero to the hypothesis $H$ means that $P(H) = 0$, and thus $P(H|E) = 0$ for any evidence $E$. This implies that no amount of evidence can ever change your belief in the hypothesis.

#### 2. **Justification and Rationale**

- **Openness to Revision**: The rule encourages openness to revising beliefs in light of new evidence. It acknowledges the possibility of being wrong and the need for flexibility in updating beliefs.

- **Avoiding Absolute Certainty**: Assigning a prior of zero implies absolute certainty that the hypothesis is false, which is often unjustified in practice. Cromwell’s Rule warns against such dogmatism.

- **Mathematical Implication**: Mathematically, if $P(H) = 0$, then for any evidence $E$:

  $$ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} = 0 $$

  This means that no evidence can ever increase the probability of $H$.

#### 3. **Applications of Cromwell’s Rule**

- **Scientific Hypotheses**: Scientists should avoid ruling out hypotheses a priori. Even seemingly unlikely hypotheses should be given a non-zero prior probability to allow for the possibility of unexpected evidence.

  - **Example**: In the early 20th century, the hypothesis that the universe is expanding was initially considered highly unlikely. However, evidence from [[Edwin Hubble|Hubble]]'s observations led to the acceptance of the expanding universe model. If this hypothesis had been assigned a prior probability of zero, it could never have been updated to reflect the evidence.

- **Legal Reasoning**: In legal contexts, Cromwell’s Rule suggests that one should not completely discount any scenario unless it is logically impossible. This ensures that all plausible explanations are considered.

- **Medical Diagnosis**: Physicians should maintain openness to rare or unexpected diagnoses, avoiding zero priors to allow for the possibility that new symptoms or test results might support them.

#### 4. **Philosophical Implications**

- **Fallibilism**: Cromwell’s Rule aligns with the philosophical position of fallibilism, which holds that all beliefs are potentially subject to revision based on new evidence.

- **Rational Belief Updating**: The rule supports the idea that rational belief updating requires non-zero priors to ensure that evidence can effectively update beliefs.

#### 5. **Criticisms and Challenges**

- **Priors in Practice**: While the rule is a sound philosophical guideline, in practice, assigning non-zero priors to an extensive range of hypotheses can be challenging. Determining appropriate non-zero priors requires careful consideration and domain expertise.

- **Extremely Low Probabilities**: Even if priors are not zero, extremely low prior probabilities can still make it difficult for evidence to significantly update the posterior probability. Balancing between being open to new evidence and maintaining practical priors is an ongoing challenge.

#### 6. **Examples and Case Studies**

- **Example 1: The Existence of Extraterrestrial Life**
  - Suppose the hypothesis $H$ is that extraterrestrial life exists. Assigning $P(H) = 0$ means that no amount of evidence (e.g., signals from space, microbial life on other planets) can ever convince us of this hypothesis. Instead, a small but non-zero prior keeps us open to the possibility of new evidence.

- **Example 2: The Discovery of Anomalous Scientific Results**
  - A scientific community might initially assign a very low prior probability to a revolutionary new theory (e.g., cold fusion). However, maintaining a non-zero prior allows the community to remain open to new experiments and evidence that might support the theory, avoiding premature dismissal.

### Conclusion

Cromwell’s Rule is a vital principle in Bayesian reasoning, advocating for openness to revising beliefs by avoiding zero priors unless a hypothesis is logically impossible. This rule promotes flexibility and fallibilism in belief updating, ensuring that new evidence can always be considered. While implementing the rule can be practically challenging, its philosophical and methodological benefits make it a cornerstone of [[rational decision-making]] and scientific inquiry.
