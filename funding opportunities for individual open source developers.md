### Mathematical Model for Income Optimization

To model income optimization from various funding sources, let:
- \( D_i \) be the income from donations \( i \).
- \( C_j \) be the income from crowdfunding projects \( j \).
- \( G_k \) be the income from grants \( k \).
- \( S_l \) be the income from sponsorships \( l \).
- \( B_m \) be the income from bounties \( m \).
- \( F_n \) be the income from freelance work \( n \).
- \( M_p \) be the income from merchandise sales \( p \).

The total income \( I \) can be represented as:

$$
I = \sum_{i=1}^{N_D} D_i + \sum_{j=1}^{N_C} C_j + \sum_{k=1}^{N_G} G_k + \sum_{l=1}^{N_S} S_l + \sum_{m=1}^{N_B} B_m + \sum_{n=1}^{N_F} F_n + \sum_{p=1}^{N_M} M_p
$$

where \( N_D, N_C, N_G, N_S, N_B, N_F, N_M \) are the number of income sources in each category.

The objective is to maximize \( I \) while considering the time and effort constraints associated with each source.

### Key Terms and Concepts
