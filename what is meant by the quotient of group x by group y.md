title: what is meant by the quotient of group x by group y

**USER**

what is meant by "the quotient of group X by group Y"


**ASSISTANT**

The phrase "the quotient of group \(X\) by group \(Y\)" refers to a construction in group theory and differential geometry where we form a new space (often called a quotient space) from a group \(X\) by partitioning it into cosets of a subgroup \(Y\).

### Quotient of Groups: Cosets

Let \(G\) be a group and \(H\) be a subgroup of \(G\). The quotient of \(G\) by \(H\), denoted \(G/H\), is the set of left cosets of \(H\) in \(G\).

#### Cosets

A **left coset** of \(H\) in \(G\) is a set of the form:
\[ gH = \{gh \mid h \in H\} \]
for some \(g \in G\). Each element \(g\) in \(G\) defines a unique coset, and the collection of all such cosets forms the quotient set \(G/H\).

### Quotient Spaces: Homogeneous Spaces

In the context of symmetric spaces and Lie groups, the quotient space \(G/H\) often refers to a homogeneous space, where \(G\) is a Lie group and \(H\) is a closed subgroup of \(G\).

#### Homogeneous Spaces

A **homogeneous space** is a space that looks the same at every point; formally, it is a manifold on which a Lie group acts transitively. If \(G\) is a Lie group and \(H\) is a closed subgroup, the quotient space \(G/H\) is the set of left cosets of \(H\) in \(G\) and can be given a smooth manifold structure such that \(G\) acts smoothly on \(G/H\).

#### Example: Spheres

Consider the example of the \(n\)-dimensional sphere \(S^n\):
\[ S^n = \frac{\text{SO}(n+1)}{\text{SO}(n)} \]

- **Group \(G\)**: \(\text{SO}(n+1)\) is the group of rotations in \((n+1)\)-dimensional space.
- **Subgroup \(H\)**: \(\text{SO}(n)\) is the group of rotations in \(n\)-dimensional space.

The quotient \(\text{SO}(n+1)/\text{SO}(n)\) describes the sphere \(S^n\) as the set of rotations in \((n+1)\)-dimensional space modulo the rotations that fix an \(n\)-dimensional subspace. Each coset in \(\text{SO}(n+1)/\text{SO}(n)\) corresponds to a unique point on the sphere.

### Formal Definition

More formally, if \(G\) is a Lie group and \(H\) is a closed subgroup, the quotient space \(G/H\) can be given a manifold structure such that the natural projection \(\pi: G \to G/H\) defined by \(\pi(g) = gH\) is a smooth map. The manifold \(G/H\) is then called a homogeneous space, and \(G\) acts on \(G/H\) by left multiplication:
\[ g' \cdot (gH) = (g'g)H \]

### Intuitive Explanation

Intuitively, when we take the quotient of \(G\) by \(H\), we are collapsing all elements of \(G\) that are related by elements of \(H\) into single points. This process "factors out" the subgroup \(H\) from \(G\), resulting in a new space where the symmetries represented by \(H\) are considered as trivial or redundant.

### Examples Revisited

- **Spheres \(S^n = \text{SO}(n+1)/\text{SO}(n)\)**: Each point on the sphere can be thought of as a distinct coset of rotations modulo the stabilizing rotations.
- **Complex Projective Spaces \(\mathbb{C}P^n = \text{SU}(n+1)/\text{S}(\text{U}(n) \times \text{U}(1))\)**: Each point in complex projective space is an equivalence class of complex vectors under the action of unitary transformations preserving the projective structure.
- **Grassmannians \(G_{k,n} = \text{SO}(n)/(\text{SO}(k) \times \text{SO}(n-k))\)**: Each point in the Grassmannian is a \(k\)-dimensional subspace of an \(n\)-dimensional space, represented by the quotient of the rotation group by the stabilizers of the subspaces.

### Summary

The quotient of a group \(G\) by a subgroup \(H\) forms a new space where the elements of \(H\) are "factored out," yielding a space of cosets. In the context of symmetric spaces, this construction often yields important geometric objects that can be studied through the lens of group actions and differential geometry.
