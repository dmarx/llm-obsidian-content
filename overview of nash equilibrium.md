### Overview of Nash Equilibrium

Nash Equilibrium, named after mathematician John Nash, is a fundamental concept in game theory that describes a situation in which no player can benefit by changing strategies while the other players' strategies remain unchanged. This concept is crucial for analyzing the outcomes of strategic interactions where each participant's payoff depends on the strategies adopted by others.

### Formal Definition

A Nash Equilibrium is a set of strategies (one for each player in the game) such that no player can increase their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy, given the strategies of the other players. Mathematically, for a game with \( n \) players where each player \( i \) chooses a strategy \( s_i \) from a set \( S_i \), a strategy profile \( (s_1, s_2, ..., s_n) \) is a Nash Equilibrium if:

$$
\pi_i(s_1, ..., s_i, ..., s_n) \geq \pi_i(s_1, ..., s_i', ..., s_n) \text{ for all } s_i' \in S_i \text{ and for all } i
$$

Here, \( \pi_i \) represents the payoff function for player \( i \).

### Types of Nash Equilibrium

#### Pure vs. Mixed Nash Equilibrium

- **Pure Nash Equilibrium**: Each player chooses one strategy with certainty. This type is more straightforward and occurs when the strategy profile consists entirely of pure strategies.
- **Mixed Nash Equilibrium**: Players randomize over two or more strategies with specific probabilities. This type is particularly relevant in games where no pure Nash Equilibrium exists or where multiple players influence the outcome.

#### Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium

This is a refinement of Nash Equilibrium applicable in dynamic games with a sequential structure. A strategy profile is a Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium if it represents a Nash Equilibrium in every subgame of the original game. This concept is crucial for ensuring that strategies are credible and optimal at every stage of the game.

### Examples

#### Prisoner's Dilemma

In the classic [[Prisoner's Dilemma|Prisoner's Dilemma]], the Nash Equilibrium occurs when both players choose to defect, even though mutual cooperation would lead to a better collective outcome. This example highlights how Nash Equilibria are not necessarily optimal from a collective standpoint.

#### Coordination Games

In games like the Stag Hunt, multiple Nash Equilibria can exist, such as both players hunting stag (cooperation) or both hunting rabbit (defection). The choice of equilibrium can depend on expectations about the other player's behavior or external enforcement mechanisms.

### Applications

Nash Equilibrium is a powerful tool across many fields:
- **Economics**: Analyzing market strategies where companies decide on pricing, product launches, and other business strategies based on the anticipated reactions of competitors.
- **Political Science**: Understanding treaties, electoral strategies, and legislative negotiations.
- **Biology**: Modeling evolutionary strategies where the success of a strategy depends on its interaction with strategies adopted by other members of a population.

### Conclusion

Nash Equilibrium provides a way to predict the outcome of strategic interactions in competitive environments. It is a cornerstone of economic and strategic thinking, offering insights into human behavior, the logic of strategic decisions, and potential outcomes in various scenarios. Understanding Nash Equilibrium helps explain why individuals or groups often settle on sub-optimal strategies in complex interactive settings.
