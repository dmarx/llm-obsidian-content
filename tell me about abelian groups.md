tell me about abelian groups


**ASSISTANT**

An **Abelian group**, named after the Norwegian mathematician Niels Henrik Abel, is a fundamental concept in the field of abstract algebra, particularly within group theory. An Abelian group is characterized by the property that its group operation is commutative. In other words, for any two elements $a$ and $b$ in the group, the result of the operation applied to $a$ and $b$ in any order is the same: $a * b = b * a$.

Formally, a set $G$ with an operation $*$ is considered an Abelian group if it satisfies the following four axioms:

1. **Closure**: For any two elements $a, b \in G$, the result of the operation $a * b$ is also in $G$.
2. **Associativity**: For any three elements $a, b, c \in G$, the equation $(a * b) * c = a * (b * c)$ holds.
3. **Identity Element**: There exists an element $e \in G$ such that for every element $a \in G$, the equation $e * a = a * e = a$ holds. This element $e$ is known as the identity element.
4. **Inverse Element**: For each element $a \in G$, there exists an element $b \in G$ such that $a * b = b * a = e$, where $e$ is the identity element of the group.

The commutative property distinguishes Abelian groups from non-Abelian groups, where the group operation might not be commutative.

### Examples

1. **The Integers under Addition ($\mathbb{Z}, +$)**: The set of all integers with the operation of addition forms an Abelian group. The identity element is $0$, and the inverse of any integer $n$ is its negation $-n$.
2. **The Real Numbers under Addition ($\mathbb{R}, +$)**: Similarly, the set of all real numbers with addition is an Abelian group, with $0$ as the identity element and $-r$ as the inverse of any real number $r$.
3. **The Multiplicative Group of Non-zero Real Numbers ($\mathbb{R}^*, \times$)**: The set of all non-zero real numbers with multiplication as the operation forms an Abelian group. Here, the identity element is $1$, and the inverse of any non-zero real number $r$ is its reciprocal $1/r$.

Abelian groups are ubiquitous in mathematics and are used in various areas, including algebra, number theory, and beyond. Their commutative nature often simplifies the structure and analysis of problems in which they appear.
