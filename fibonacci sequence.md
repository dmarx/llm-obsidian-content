fibonacci sequence


**ASSISTANT**

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. It is a classic example of a sequence defined by a recurrence relation.

## Definition

The Fibonacci sequence can be formally defined as:

$$
F(n) =
\begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } n = 0 \\
1 & \text{if } n = 1 \\
F(n-1) + F(n-2) & \text{if } n > 1
\end{cases}
$$

Here, $F(n)$ denotes the $n$-th Fibonacci number.

### Initial Terms

The first few terms of the Fibonacci sequence are:
$$
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, \ldots
$$

## Closed-form Expression

The Fibonacci sequence also has a closed-form solution known as Binet's formula:

$$
F(n) = \frac{\varphi^n - \psi^n}{\sqrt{5}}
$$

where $\varphi$ (the golden ratio) and $\psi$ are defined as:

$$
\varphi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \approx 1.618 \\
\psi = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \approx -0.618
$$

This formula provides a direct way to compute the $n$-th Fibonacci number without recursion or iteration.

## Matrix Representation

The Fibonacci sequence can also be represented using matrix exponentiation. Define the transformation matrix $A$ as:

$$
A =
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 1 \\
1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Then, the $n$-th Fibonacci number can be obtained by:

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
F(n+1) \\
F(n)
\end{pmatrix}
= A^n
\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\
0
\end{pmatrix}
$$

This matrix exponentiation approach allows for efficient computation of Fibonacci numbers using logarithmic time complexity $O(\log n)$.

## Recursive Implementation

A straightforward way to compute Fibonacci numbers is via a recursive function:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
```

However, this implementation has exponential time complexity $O(2^n)$ and is inefficient for large $n$.

## Dynamic Programming Approach

A more efficient approach is to use dynamic programming to store computed values and avoid redundant calculations:

```python
def fibonacci_dp(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    
    fib = [0] * (n + 1)
    fib[1] = 1
    
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        fib[i] = fib[i - 1] + fib[i - 2]
    
    return fib[n]
```

This approach has a time complexity of $O(n)$ and a space complexity of $O(n)$.

## Iterative Approach

An even more space-efficient method uses an iterative approach:

```python
def fibonacci_iterative(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(2, n + 1):
        a, b = b, a + b
    
    return b
```

This method maintains a constant space complexity $O(1)$ and linear time complexity $O(n)$.

## Applications

The Fibonacci sequence appears in various domains:

- **[[Number Theory]]**: Fibonacci numbers have interesting properties and relationships with other mathematical constructs.
- **[[Algorithms]]**: Many algorithms, especially those involving recursive structures, can be optimized using the Fibonacci sequence.
- **[[Computer Science]]**: Fibonacci heaps and search algorithms use Fibonacci numbers for performance improvements.
- **[[Biology]]**: The Fibonacci sequence appears in biological settings, such as the branching of trees, the arrangement of leaves, and the patterns of various fruits and flowers.

Understanding the Fibonacci sequence and its properties is fundamental in both theoretical and applied mathematics.
