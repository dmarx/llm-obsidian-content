## Large Deviations in Statistical Physics

### Overview

Large deviations theory is a branch of probability theory that deals with the asymptotic behavior of remote tails of sequences of probability distributions. In the context of statistical physics, [[large deviations theory]] provides a rigorous framework for understanding the probabilities of rare events in systems with many degrees of freedom, such as disordered systems, phase transitions, and fluctuations in thermodynamic quantities.

### Fundamental Concepts

#### Large Deviations Principle (LDP)

The Large Deviations Principle formalizes the idea that the probability of certain rare events decays exponentially with the system size. For a sequence of random variables $\{X_n\}$, the LDP is characterized by a rate function $I(x)$ such that:

$$
\Pr(X_n \approx x) \sim \exp(-n I(x)),
$$

where $I(x)$ is a non-negative, lower semi-continuous function that vanishes at its minimum.

#### Rate Function

The rate function $I(x)$ plays a central role in [[large deviations theory]]. It quantifies the exponential decay of the probability of deviations from the typical behavior. For a sequence of i.i.d. random variables with moment generating function $M(\lambda) = \mathbb{E}[\exp(\lambda X)]$, the rate function can be obtained via the Legendre-Fenchel transform:

$$
I(x) = \sup_{\lambda} \left( \lambda x - \log M(\lambda) \right).
$$

### Applications in Statistical Physics

Large deviations theory is used to study various phenomena in statistical physics, particularly those involving rare events and extreme fluctuations.

#### Thermodynamic Fluctuations

In statistical mechanics, the macroscopic properties of a system are derived from the collective behavior of a large number of microscopic components. Large deviations theory helps to understand the probability of significant deviations from the expected macroscopic behavior. For example, the probability of observing a large fluctuation in the energy $E$ of a system at temperature $T$ is given by:

$$
\Pr(E) \sim \exp(-n I(E)),
$$

where $I(E)$ is the rate function associated with energy fluctuations.

#### Phase Transitions

Near phase transitions, [[large deviations theory]] can be used to study the distribution of order parameters and their fluctuations. For instance, in the Ising model, the magnetization $M$ exhibits large deviations near the critical temperature. The probability of observing a magnetization far from its mean value can be expressed as:

$$
\Pr(M) \sim \exp(-n I(M)),
$$

where $I(M)$ captures the nature of the phase transition and the critical phenomena.

#### Spin Glasses

In disordered systems like spin glasses, [[large deviations theory]] provides insights into the distribution of overlaps and free energy fluctuations. The complex energy landscape of spin glasses results in a broad distribution of states, and large deviations help quantify the likelihood of observing rare configurations.

### Mathematical Framework

#### Cramér's Theorem

Cramér's theorem is a fundamental result in [[large deviations theory]]. It states that for a sequence of i.i.d. random variables $\{X_i\}$ with mean $\mu$ and cumulant generating function $\Lambda(\lambda) = \log \mathbb{E}[\exp(\lambda X_i)]$, the sample mean $\overline{X}_n = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i$ satisfies an LDP with rate function:

$$
I(x) = \sup_{\lambda} (\lambda x - \Lambda(\lambda)).
$$

#### Gartner-Ellis Theorem

The Gartner-Ellis theorem extends Cramér's theorem to non-i.i.d. settings. It provides conditions under which a sequence of random variables satisfies an LDP, based on the limit of the scaled cumulant generating function:

$$
\Lambda_n(\lambda) = \frac{1}{n} \log \mathbb{E}[\exp(n \lambda X_n)].
$$

If the limit $\Lambda(\lambda) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \Lambda_n(\lambda)$ exists, then the sequence $\{X_n\}$ satisfies an LDP with rate function:

$$
I(x) = \sup_{\lambda} (\lambda x - \Lambda(\lambda)).
$$

### Examples

1. **Gaussian Distribution**: For a sequence of i.i.d. Gaussian random variables with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$, the rate function for the sample mean $\overline{X}_n$ is:

    $$
    I(x) = \frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}.
    $$

    This indicates that large deviations from the mean $\mu$ are exponentially suppressed with a rate determined by the variance $\sigma^2$.

2. **Current Fluctuations in Diffusive Systems**: In systems described by fluctuating hydrodynamics, [[large deviations theory]] can be used to study current fluctuations. For example, the probability of observing a large deviation in the particle current $J$ over a time interval $t$ can be written as:

    $$
    \Pr(J) \sim \exp(-t I(J)),
    $$

    where $I(J)$ is the rate function capturing the statistics of current fluctuations.
