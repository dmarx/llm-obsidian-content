# Regret Analysis

Regret analysis is a mathematical framework for evaluating the performance of [[online decision-making algorithms]] by measuring the difference between an algorithm's actual performance and the performance of an optimal strategy selected with perfect hindsight. It provides a rigorous approach to analyzing algorithms that must make sequential decisions under uncertainty.

## Mathematical Formalization

### Basic Definition

The regret of an online algorithm $\mathcal{A}$ over $T$ time steps is defined as:

$$R_T(\mathcal{A}) = \sum_{t=1}^T [r_t(a^*) - r_t(a_t)]$$

Where:
- $a_t$ is the action selected by algorithm $\mathcal{A}$ at time $t$
- $a^*$ is the best fixed action in hindsight
- $r_t(a)$ is the reward of action $a$ at time $t$

### External Regret

The standard notion of regret compares against the best fixed action:

$$R_T^{\text{ext}}(\mathcal{A}) = \max_{a \in \mathcal{A}} \sum_{t=1}^T [r_t(a) - r_t(a_t)]$$

### Internal Regret

A more refined notion comparing decisions within the algorithm's policy:

$$R_T^{\text{int}}(\mathcal{A}) = \max_{i,j} \sum_{t:a_t=i} [r_t(j) - r_t(i)]$$

This measures how much the algorithm would gain by replacing one action with another.

### Policy Regret

For reinforcement learning contexts, comparing against the optimal policy:

$$R_T^{\text{pol}}(\mathcal{A}) = \sum_{t=1}^T [V^*(s_t) - Q^*(s_t, a_t)]$$

Where $V^*$ and $Q^*$ are the optimal value and action-value functions.

## Theoretical Bounds

### Lower Bounds

For many problems, fundamental limits exist on achievable regret:

$$R_T \geq \Omega(\sqrt{KT})$$

Where $K$ is the number of possible actions and $T$ is the time horizon.

### Upper Bounds for Key Algorithms

#### Multi-Armed Bandits

For stochastic bandits with UCB algorithm:

$$R_T \leq O\left(\sum_{i: \Delta_i > 0} \frac{\log T}{\Delta_i}\right)$$

Where $\Delta_i$ is the suboptimality gap of arm $i$.

#### Experts Problem

For the Hedge algorithm with appropriate learning rate:

$$R_T \leq O(\sqrt{T \log N})$$

Where $N$ is the number of experts.

#### Online Convex Optimization

For Online Gradient Descent with convex functions:

$$R_T \leq O(G D \sqrt{T})$$

Where $G$ is the gradient bound and $D$ is the decision set diameter.

## Analysis Techniques

### 1. [[Potential Function Method]]

Using a potential function to track progress:

$$\Phi_t = f(\text{algorithm state at time } t)$$

The analysis shows: $R_T \leq \Phi_T - \Phi_0 + \text{error terms}$

### 2. [[Follow-the-Regularized-Leader Analysis]]

Analyzing the difference between consecutive decisions:

$$R_T \leq \sum_{t=1}^T [r_t(a_t) - r_t(a_{t+1})] + \text{regularization penalty}$$

### 3. [[Online-to-Batch Conversion]]

Converting online regret bounds to generalization bounds:

$$\mathbb{E}[L(w)] - L(w^*) \leq \frac{\mathbb{E}[R_T]}{T}$$

Where $L$ is a loss function and $w$ are model parameters.

## Regret Types and Guarantees

### 1. [[Sublinear Regret]]

When regret grows slower than the time horizon:

$$R_T = o(T)$$

This implies the per-round performance approaches optimal as $T$ increases.

### 2. [[Logarithmic Regret]]

For well-structured problems:

$$R_T = O(\log T)$$

Common in stochastic environments with sufficient structure.

### 3. [[Constant Regret]]

In special cases, regret may be bounded independently of time:

$$R_T = O(1)$$

### 4. [[High-Probability Regret Bounds]]

Bounds that hold with high probability rather than just in expectation:

$$P(R_T > \text{bound}) \leq \delta$$

## Applications to Data Structures

### 1. [[Self-Adjusting Data Structures]]

For structures like [[splay trees]], regret analysis shows:

$$R_T \leq O(m \log n)$$

Where $m$ is the number of operations and $n$ is the structure size.

### 2. [[Adaptive Caching]]

For cache replacement algorithms:

$$R_T \leq O(k \log T)$$

Where $k$ is the cache size.

### 3. [[Neural Self-Adjusting Structures]]

Neural networks trained to minimize regret:

$$\min_\theta \mathbb{E}[R_T(\pi_\theta)]$$

Where $\pi_\theta$ is a policy parameterized by $\theta$.

## Advanced Concepts

### 1. [[Adversarial Regret]]

Against adversaries who can choose rewards to maximize regret:

$$R_T^{\text{adv}} = \max_{\{r_t\}} [R_T(\mathcal{A}, \{r_t\})]$$

### 2. [[Contextual Regret]]

When decisions depend on observed contexts:

$$R_T^{\text{ctx}} = \sum_{t=1}^T [r_t(a^*(x_t), x_t) - r_t(a_t, x_t)]$$

Where $x_t$ is the context at time $t$.

### 3. [[Dynamic Regret]]

Comparing against time-varying optimal actions:

$$R_T^{\text{dyn}} = \sum_{t=1}^T [r_t(a_t^*) - r_t(a_t)]$$

With $a_t^*$ being the optimal action specifically for time $t$.

## Connection to Other Frameworks

### 1. [[Competitive Analysis]]

Relation to competitive ratio $c$:

$$R_T \leq (c-1) \cdot \text{OPT} \implies \text{Competitive Ratio} \leq c$$

### 2. [[PAC Learning]]

Conversion between regret and PAC bounds:

$$\epsilon \approx \frac{R_T}{T} \text{ and } \delta \approx \frac{1}{T}$$

### 3. [[Sample Complexity]]

Relationship to sample complexity bounds:

$$n \geq \Omega\left(\frac{R_T^2}{\epsilon^2 \log(1/\delta)}\right)$$

## Research Frontiers

### 1. [[Instance-Dependent Regret Bounds]]

Bounds that adapt to the specific problem instance:

$$R_T \leq f(\text{instance-specific parameters}) \cdot \text{poly}(\log T)$$

### 2. [[Multi-Agent Regret Minimization]]

Extending to settings with multiple interacting agents:

$$R_T^i = \sum_{t=1}^T [r_t^i(a^{i,*}, a_{-t}^{-i}) - r_t^i(a_t^i, a_t^{-i})]$$

### 3. [[Delayed Feedback Regret]]

Analyzing settings where feedback is received with delay:

$$R_T^{\text{delay}} = \sum_{t=1}^T [r_{t-d_t}(a^*) - r_{t-d_t}(a_t)]$$

Where $d_t$ is the delay at time $t$.

Regret analysis continues to be a foundational framework for theoretical algorithm development, providing a principled approach to design, analyze, and compare algorithms across various domains including machine learning, online optimization, and adaptive data structures.
