### Kelly Criterion

The **Kelly Criterion** is a formula used to determine the optimal size of a series of bets to maximize the long-term growth rate of wealth. It is particularly useful in gambling and investment contexts where the objective is to maximize the growth of capital over time while managing risk.

### Formula

The Kelly Criterion formula calculates the optimal fraction of the bankroll to bet on a given wager:

$$
f^* = \frac{bp - q}{b}
$$

where:
- \( f^* \) is the fraction of the bankroll to bet.
- \( b \) is the net odds received on the bet (i.e., if the odds are 3-to-1, \( b = 3 \)).
- \( p \) is the probability of winning the bet.
- \( q \) is the probability of losing the bet (\( q = 1 - p \)).

### Derivation

The goal is to maximize the expected logarithm of wealth, \( \mathbb{E}[\log(W)] \), where \( W \) is the wealth after betting.

1. **Wealth Update**: After placing a bet \( f \) of the bankroll \( W \), the wealth \( W \) evolves as follows:
   - If the bet wins, the new wealth is \( W(1 + fb) \).
   - If the bet loses, the new wealth is \( W(1 - f) \).

2. **Expected Logarithm of Wealth**:
   \[
   \mathbb{E}[\log(W')] = p \log(W(1 + fb)) + q \log(W(1 - f))
   \]
   \[
   \mathbb{E}[\log(W')] = \log(W) + p \log(1 + fb) + q \log(1 - f)
   \]

3. **Maximizing the Expected Logarithm**:
   To find the optimal fraction \( f^* \), we take the derivative of the expected logarithm with respect to \( f \) and set it to zero:
   \[
   \frac{d}{df} \left( p \log(1 + fb) + q \log(1 - f) \right) = 0
   \]
   \[
   \frac{pb}{1 + fb} - \frac{q}{1 - f} = 0
   \]
   Solving for \( f \), we get:
   \[
   f^* = \frac{bp - q}{b}
   \]

### Interpretation

The Kelly Criterion balances the trade-off between the probability of winning, the odds received, and the probability of losing to determine the optimal bet size that maximizes the long-term growth rate of wealth.

- If \( f^* \) is positive, it indicates the fraction of the bankroll to bet.
- If \( f^* \) is negative, it suggests that the bet should not be placed (as the expected value is negative).
- The criterion naturally adjusts the bet size to be proportional to the perceived edge in the bet.

### Example

Consider a bet where the probability of winning is 60% (\( p = 0.6 \)) and the net odds are 2-to-1 (\( b = 2 \)).

Using the Kelly Criterion formula:
\[
f^* = \frac{2 \cdot 0.6 - 0.4}{2} = \frac{1.2 - 0.4}{2} = \frac{0.8}{2} = 0.4
\]

This means that the optimal fraction of the bankroll to bet is 40%.

### Practical Considerations

1. **Fractional Kelly**: In practice, many bettors and investors use a fractional Kelly strategy (e.g., half-Kelly) to reduce risk and volatility. This involves betting a fraction of the Kelly amount to provide a more conservative approach.
2. **Estimation of Parameters**: The Kelly Criterion relies on accurate estimates of the probabilities \( p \) and the odds \( b \). Incorrect estimates can lead to suboptimal or even detrimental betting sizes.
3. **Multiple Bets**: When dealing with multiple simultaneous bets, the problem becomes more complex, and the optimal fractions can be determined using portfolio optimization techniques.

### Applications

#### 1. **Gambling**

The Kelly Criterion is commonly used in gambling to optimize bet sizes in games with known probabilities and odds, such as sports betting, horse racing, and casino games.

#### 2. **Investing**

In investing, the Kelly Criterion can be applied to allocate capital among different investment opportunities, aiming to maximize the growth rate of the investment portfolio. For example, in stock trading, the criterion helps determine the proportion of the portfolio to allocate to each stock based on the expected return and risk.

### Limitations

1. **Estimation Risk**: The criterion requires precise estimates of winning probabilities and odds, which may not always be available or accurate.
2. **Risk Aversion**: The Kelly Criterion assumes that the bettor or investor is risk-neutral and solely focused on maximizing long-term growth. It does not account for varying levels of risk aversion.
3. **Capital Constraints**: In real-world scenarios, there may be constraints on the amount of capital available for betting or investing, which can affect the applicability of the Kelly Criterion.

### Conclusion

The Kelly Criterion provides a mathematically sound approach to optimizing bet sizes and investment allocations to maximize the long-term growth rate of wealth. By balancing the probability of winning, the odds received, and the probability of losing, it offers a robust framework for decision-making in gambling and investing. However, practical considerations such as estimation risk, risk aversion, and capital constraints must be taken into account when applying the Kelly Criterion in real-world scenarios. Understanding and effectively using the Kelly Criterion can significantly enhance the performance of betting strategies and investment portfolios.
