### Canonical Divergence and KL Divergence in the Logit Model

In the context of binary choice models, the logit model has a distinctive geometric property: the canonical divergence and the Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence are equivalent. This property highlights the logit model's unique position within the class of binary choice models.

#### Definitions:

1. **Canonical Divergence**:
   - In a dually flat manifold, the canonical divergence $D(p \parallel q)$ between two points $p$ and $q$ is defined in terms of the dual potentials $\psi$ and $\psi^*$.
   - For points $\theta$ (corresponding to $p$) and $\theta'$ (corresponding to $q$), the canonical divergence is given by:
     $$
     D(\theta \parallel \theta') = \psi(\theta) + \psi^*(\theta') - \sum_{i} \theta_i \frac{\partial \psi^*(\theta')}{\partial \theta'_i}
     $$

2. **Kullback–Leibler (KL) Divergence**:
   - The KL divergence measures the difference between two probability distributions $P$ and $Q$:
     $$
     D_{KL}(P \parallel Q) = \sum_{i} P(i) \log \frac{P(i)}{Q(i)}
     $$

#### Equivalence in the Logit Model:

- The logit model describes the probability of a binary outcome $y$ given a vector of predictors $x$ using the logistic function:
  $$
  P(y = 1 | x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\beta^T x}}
  $$
- This model has the unique property that its canonical divergence is identical to the KL divergence between two distributions parameterized by $\beta$ and $\beta'$.

### Geometric Intuition:

1. **Dually Flat Space**:
   - The logit model resides in a dually flat manifold, meaning that there are two sets of affine coordinates (primal and dual) connected by a potential function. This dual flatness implies the existence of a natural geometric structure facilitating the calculation of divergences.

2. **Potential Functions**:
   - The potential function $\psi(\beta)$ and its dual $\psi^*(\eta)$ are such that the canonical divergence takes the same form as the KL divergence when $\beta$ parameterizes the logistic distribution.
   - In the logit model, $\psi$ corresponds to the log-partition function of the logistic distribution, which leads to the equivalence of divergences.

3. **Affine Coordinates and Geodesics**:
   - In the context of the logit model, the affine coordinates simplify the calculation of geodesics (shortest paths) in the parameter space. These geodesics are linear in the affine coordinates, reflecting the flat nature of the space.

### Mathematical Formalism:

- **Canonical Divergence in the Logit Model**:
  $$
  D(\beta \parallel \beta') = \psi(\beta) + \psi^*(\beta') - \sum_{i} \beta_i \frac{\partial \psi^*(\beta')}{\partial \beta'_i}
  $$
  Given the form of the logistic function, $\psi(\beta)$ can be interpreted as the log-likelihood of the logistic model.

- **KL Divergence in the Logit Model**:
  $$
  D_{KL}(P_{\beta} \parallel P_{\beta'}) = E_{\beta} \left[ \log \frac{P_{\beta}(y|x)}{P_{\beta'}(y|x)} \right]
  $$
  When $P_{\beta}(y|x)$ and $P_{\beta'}(y|x)$ are logistic distributions, the KL divergence simplifies to a form equivalent to the canonical divergence due to the specific properties of the logistic function.

### Conclusion:

The equivalence of canonical divergence and KL divergence in the logit model underscores a deep geometric symmetry. This property not only distinguishes the logit model from other binary choice models (like the probit model) but also provides a powerful tool for statistical inference and optimization. The dually flat manifold structure makes the logit model particularly convenient for maximum likelihood estimation and hypothesis testing, leveraging the simplicity and elegance of its geometric properties.
