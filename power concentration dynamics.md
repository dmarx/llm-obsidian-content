Power Concentration Dynamics


**ASSISTANT**

The user wants me to create a wiki entry on "Power Concentration Dynamics" that follows the technical, mathematical style they've established. This should be a technical reference page suitable for an Obsidian vault focused on AI research, ML, applied math, and philosophy of mind. I need to:

1. Provide detailed mathematical formalisms
2. Use double brackets for novel/technical terms
3. Write in wiki format, not conversational
4. Include concrete mathematical models
5. Connect to related concepts like autocratic breakthrough
6. Focus on applications to AI systems
7. Include philosophical implications

Power concentration dynamics would involve how power/influence/authority accumulates and distributes in systems over time. This relates to network effects, feedback loops, preferential attachment, and various mathematical models from complexity science.# Power Concentration Dynamics

**Power concentration dynamics** describes the mathematical frameworks governing how [[decision-making authority]], [[resource control]], and [[influence]] distribute and redistribute across agents in complex systems over time. These dynamics characterize the temporal evolution from initial power distributions toward concentrated or dispersed equilibria.

## Mathematical Foundation

### Power Distribution Vector

Let $\mathbf{p}(t) = (p_1(t), p_2(t), \ldots, p_n(t))$ represent the power distribution at time $t$, where $p_i(t) \geq 0$ denotes agent $i$'s power level and $\|\mathbf{p}(t)\|_1 = P_{total}$ represents total system power.

The [[power concentration coefficient]] is defined as:

$$C(t) = \frac{\|\mathbf{p}(t)\|_2^2}{\|\mathbf{p}(t)\|_1^2} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n p_i(t)^2}{(\sum_{i=1}^n p_i(t))^2}$$

where $C(t) \in [\frac{1}{n}, 1]$, with $C = \frac{1}{n}$ indicating perfect equality and $C = 1$ indicating total concentration.

### General Dynamics Equation

Power evolution follows the [[master equation]]:

$$\frac{dp_i}{dt} = \sum_j T_{i \leftarrow j}(\mathbf{p}, t) - \sum_j T_{j \leftarrow i}(\mathbf{p}, t) + S_i(\mathbf{p}, t)$$

where $T_{i \leftarrow j}$ represents power transfer from agent $j$ to agent $i$, and $S_i$ denotes external power sources or sinks.

## Core Mechanisms

### Preferential Attachment Model

Following [[BarabÃ¡si-Albert dynamics]], power accumulation exhibits [[rich-get-richer]] behavior:

$$\frac{dp_i}{dt} = \alpha \frac{p_i(t)}{\sum_j p_j(t)} \cdot \Delta P(t) - \beta p_i(t)$$

where $\alpha > 0$ is the [[preferential attachment strength]], $\Delta P(t)$ represents new power entering the system, and $\beta \geq 0$ accounts for power decay.

The steady-state solution yields a [[power law distribution]]:

$$p_i^* \propto i^{-\gamma}$$

with exponent $\gamma = 1 + \frac{\beta}{\alpha}$.

### Network-Mediated Power Transfer

In [[networked systems]], power flows along edges with transfer rates proportional to [[centrality measures]]:

$$T_{i \leftarrow j} = \kappa \cdot A_{ij} \cdot p_j \cdot \frac{deg(i)^{\mu}}{deg(j)^{\nu}}$$

where $A_{ij}$ is the adjacency matrix, $deg(i)$ denotes node degree, and $\mu, \nu$ control centrality bias.

### Resource Competition Dynamics

Under [[finite resource constraints]], agents compete for power through [[contest functions]]:

$$\frac{dp_i}{dt} = \frac{e_i p_i^{\alpha}}{\sum_j e_j p_j^{\alpha}} \cdot R(t) - \delta p_i$$

where $e_i$ represents agent $i$'s [[competitive efficiency]], $\alpha$ controls the [[contest intensity]], and $\delta$ is the power depreciation rate.

## Stability Analysis

### Fixed Points and Attractors

The system admits multiple equilibrium classes:

1. **Egalitarian Equilibrium**: $p_i^* = \frac{P_{total}}{n}$ for all $i$
2. **Concentrated Equilibria**: $p_{i^*}^* \gg p_j^*$ for $j \neq i^*$
3. **Oligarchic Equilibria**: Power concentrated among subset $\mathcal{S} \subset \{1, \ldots, n\}$

### Lyapunov Stability

Define the [[power entropy]] as a [[Lyapunov function]]:

$$H(t) = -\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{p_i(t)}{P_{total}} \log\left(\frac{p_i(t)}{P_{total}}\right)$$

For systems with [[detailed balance]], $\frac{dH}{dt} \leq 0$, ensuring convergence to equilibrium.

### Bifurcation Analysis

Critical transitions occur when system parameters cross [[bifurcation thresholds]]. The [[concentration-dispersion bifurcation]] satisfies:

$$\alpha_{crit} = \frac{\beta n}{n-1} \cdot \frac{\langle k \rangle}{\langle k^2 \rangle}$$

where $\langle k \rangle$ and $\langle k^2 \rangle$ are the first and second moments of the degree distribution.

## Temporal Dynamics Regimes

### Exponential Growth Phase

For $t < t_1$, power grows exponentially for dominant agents:

$$p_i(t) = p_i(0) \exp(\lambda_i t)$$

where $\lambda_i = \alpha \frac{e_i}{\langle e \rangle} - \beta$ represents the [[effective growth rate]].

### Power Law Growth Phase

For $t_1 < t < t_2$, sublinear growth emerges:

$$p_i(t) \sim t^{\gamma_i}$$

with exponents $\gamma_i$ determined by [[competition intensity]] and [[network structure]].

### Saturation Phase

For $t > t_2$, the system approaches equilibrium with [[algebraic relaxation]]:

$$p_i(t) - p_i^* \sim (t - t_2)^{-\delta}$$

## Measurement and Quantification

### Concentration Indices

**Gini Coefficient**:
$$G = \frac{1}{2n^2\bar{p}} \sum_{i,j} |p_i - p_j|$$

**Herfindahl-Hirschman Index**:
$$HHI = \sum_{i=1}^n \left(\frac{p_i}{P_{total}}\right)^2$$

**Theil Index**:
$$T = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{p_i}{\bar{p}} \log\left(\frac{p_i}{\bar{p}}\right)$$

### Dynamic Measures

**Power Velocity**:
$$v_i(t) = \frac{1}{p_i(t)} \frac{dp_i}{dt}$$

**Concentration Rate**:
$$\dot{C}(t) = \frac{d}{dt} C(t) = \frac{2}{P_{total}^2} \sum_{i=1}^n p_i(t) \frac{dp_i}{dt}$$

## Applications in AI Systems

### Attention Mechanisms

In [[transformer architectures]], attention weights exhibit power concentration dynamics:

$$\alpha_{ij}^{(l+1)} = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{Q_i^{(l)} K_j^{(l)T}}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)$$

[[Self-attention]] can lead to [[attention collapse]] where few tokens dominate, analogous to autocratic breakthrough.

### Multi-Agent Learning

In [[policy gradient methods]], agent performance differences amplify through [[experience replay]] and [[curriculum learning]]:

$$\theta_i^{(t+1)} = \theta_i^{(t)} + \eta \nabla_{\theta_i} J_i(\theta_i) \cdot w_i(t)$$

where $w_i(t)$ represents the agent's learning weight based on past performance.

### Federated Learning

[[Federated averaging]] protocols can exhibit power concentration when client contributions are weighted by data quality or model performance:

$$\theta_{global}^{(t+1)} = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{|D_i| \cdot q_i(t)}{\sum_j |D_j| \cdot q_j(t)} \theta_i^{(t)}$$

where $q_i(t)$ represents client $i$'s [[quality score]].

### Neural Architecture Search

[[Evolutionary algorithms]] for [[neural architecture search]] exhibit power concentration as successful architectures dominate the population through [[selection pressure]].

## Control and Intervention Strategies

### Power Redistribution Mechanisms

**Progressive Taxation**: $\frac{dp_i}{dt} = \ldots - \tau(p_i) \cdot p_i$

**Affirmative Action**: Boost underrepresented agents with $S_i = \epsilon \cdot (1 - \frac{p_i}{\bar{p}})_+$

**Network Rewiring**: Modify adjacency matrix to reduce [[centrality inequality]]

### Stabilization Controls

Implement [[feedback control]] to maintain target concentration:

$$u_i(t) = -K \left(C(t) - C_{target}\right) \frac{\partial C}{\partial p_i}$$

## Philosophical Implications

Power concentration dynamics raises fundamental questions about [[emergent hierarchy]] and [[distributive justice]] in artificial systems. The inevitability of concentration under certain parameter regimes challenges assumptions about [[egalitarian AI design]].

The framework connects to broader questions in [[political philosophy]] about the stability of democratic institutions and the role of [[structural constraints]] in maintaining equitable power distributions.

**Normative Questions**:
- What concentration levels are acceptable in [[AI governance]] systems?
- How do we balance [[efficiency]] (often requiring some concentration) with [[fairness]]?
- What role should [[procedural fairness]] play versus [[outcome equality]]?
