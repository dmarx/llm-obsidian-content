start simple and practical. this is a hello world assignment, we're not asking them to re-invent the wheel. `import openai` and get config arguments via `os.environ.get`


**ASSISTANT**

Got it! For the "Hello World" assignment, keeping it simple and practical is key, especially when it’s the students’ first exposure to Python combined with API interactions. We'll strip it down to just the essentials: importing the necessary library, configuring the environment, and making a single API call. This will focus purely on interaction with the model and setting up their environment without over-complicating things.

Here’s a structured "Hello World" assignment with those goals in mind.

## Assignment: "Hello World" with GPT API

### **Objective:**
The goal is to introduce students to Python by sending a prompt to an API-hosted GPT model. This simple task will cover:
- Importing the necessary Python libraries.
- Reading environment variables for sensitive data like API keys.
- Sending a request and printing the response.

### **Prerequisites:**
1. Python installed on your machine.
2. An API key from OpenAI (or any other hosted model service).
3. Basic knowledge of how to run Python scripts.

### **Steps**:

### 1. **Install the OpenAI Python Package**
   The first step is to install the required library. Have students run the following command to install the `openai` package:
   ```bash
   pip install openai
   ```

### 2. **Set Up Environment Variables**
   Store sensitive information like the API key securely by using environment variables instead of hardcoding them in the script. This prevents security risks and keeps the code cleaner.

   - In your terminal (or `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or environment configuration file), add the OpenAI API key:
     ```bash
     export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
     ```

### 3. **Python Script: Hello World with GPT API**
   Now, create a Python script (`hello_gpt.py`) that will make an API request to generate a response to a "Hello, world!" prompt.

   ```python
   import os
   import openai

   # Step 1: Fetch API key from environment variables
   api_key = os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")
   if not api_key:
       raise ValueError("API key not found. Set the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable.")

   # Step 2: Define a basic function to send a prompt to the API
   def query_gpt(prompt):
       openai.api_key = api_key
       response = openai.Completion.create(
           model="text-davinci-003",
           prompt=prompt,
           max_tokens=50
       )
       return response.choices[0].text.strip()

   # Step 3: Call the function with "Hello, world!" prompt
   prompt = "Hello, world!"
   response_text = query_gpt(prompt)

   # Step 4: Output the response
   print(f"AI Response: {response_text}")
   ```

### 4. **Running the Script**
   After saving the script, run it in your terminal:
   ```bash
   python hello_gpt.py
   ```

   If everything is set up correctly, the script will send the prompt `"Hello, world!"` to the GPT model and print the response.

### **Learning Outcomes**:
1. **Environment Variables**: 
   - Students learn how to securely manage sensitive information like API keys via environment variables.
2. **API Interaction**:
   - A simple introduction to making an HTTP request to a model API and getting a response.
3. **Basic String Manipulation**:
   - They’ll see how a simple prompt like `"Hello, world!"` can be processed into a dynamic response from an AI model.

### **Bonus Extension** (Optional):
Once the basic script is working, students can modify the prompt to see how the model responds to different inputs:
```python
prompt = "What is the meaning of life?"
response_text = query_gpt(prompt)
print(f"AI Response: {response_text}")
```

This simple progression keeps the assignment focused, practical, and avoids overwhelming students with too many additional tasks. It gets them hands-on with real-world, LLM-based APIs right from the start while keeping Python code accessible and straightforward.
