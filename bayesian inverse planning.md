Bayesian inverse planning is a computational framework used to infer an agent's goals, preferences, or intentions based on their observed behavior. This method leverages principles from Bayesian inference to reason backward from observed actions to the underlying cognitive processes driving those actions.

### Conceptual Overview

1. **Observed Behavior**: We start with observations of an agent's behavior over time.
2. **Hypothesized Goals**: We posit a set of potential goals, preferences, or intentions that the agent might be aiming to achieve.
3. **Model of Rational Action**: We assume the agent behaves (approximately) rationally, meaning they choose actions that are likely to lead to their goals given the constraints and information available to them.
4. **Inverse Planning**: We use Bayesian inference to estimate the probability distribution over the hypothesized goals given the observed behavior.

### Formalization

Let:
- $A = \{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\}$ denote the set of actions.
- $S = \{s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_m\}$ denote the set of states.
- $G = \{g_1, g_2, \ldots, g_k\}$ denote the set of potential goals.
- $\pi(a \mid s, g)$ denote the policy, the probability of taking action $a$ in state $s$ to achieve goal $g$.
- $O = \{o_1, o_2, \ldots, o_t\}$ denote the sequence of observed actions.

#### Likelihood

Given a goal $g$, the likelihood of observing a sequence of actions $O$ under the policy $\pi$ is:
$$
P(O \mid g) = \prod_{t=1}^{T} \pi(o_t \mid s_t, g)
$$

#### Prior

We assign a prior probability $P(g)$ to each goal $g$, which represents our belief about the likelihood of each goal before observing any behavior.

#### Posterior

Using Bayes' theorem, we update our beliefs based on the observed actions:
$$
P(g \mid O) = \frac{P(O \mid g) P(g)}{P(O)}
$$
where $P(O)$ is the marginal likelihood of observing the actions, computed as:
$$
P(O) = \sum_{g' \in G} P(O \mid g') P(g')
$$

### Steps in Bayesian Inverse Planning

1. **Model Specification**: Define the state space $S$, action space $A$, potential goals $G$, and the policy $\pi$.
2. **Observation**: Collect the sequence of observed actions $O$.
3. **Inference**: Compute the posterior distribution over goals $P(g \mid O)$ using Bayes' theorem.
4. **Interpretation**: Analyze the posterior distribution to infer the most likely goals or intentions.

### Applications

- **Robotics**: Inferring the goals of human collaborators to enable better human-robot interaction.
- **Cognitive Science**: Understanding human decision-making and planning processes.
- **Economics**: Predicting consumer behavior based on observed purchasing patterns.
- **AI Safety**: Ensuring that AI systems align with human values by inferring and adhering to human intentions.

### Example

Consider a simple grid world where an agent can move up, down, left, or right to reach a goal state. If the agent consistently moves towards a specific location, Bayesian inverse planning can help infer that the specific location is likely the agent's goal.

1. **States and Actions**:
    - States: Positions on the grid.
    - Actions: Movements in the four cardinal directions.

2. **Goals**: Potential goal states on the grid.

3. **Policy**: Probability of choosing each action given the current state and goal.

4. **Inference**: By observing the sequence of moves, we compute the posterior probabilities of each potential goal state, identifying the most likely goal based on the agent's behavior.

Bayesian inverse planning is a powerful tool for understanding and predicting behavior, providing a formal framework for reasoning about goals and intentions from observed actions. This approach is particularly valuable in domains where it is crucial to interpret and respond to the intentions of other agents.
