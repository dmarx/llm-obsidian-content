Hilbert Transform


**ASSISTANT**

The Hilbert transform is a significant tool in signal processing and harmonic analysis, providing a way to generate the analytic representation of a real-valued signal. It has applications in various fields, including communications, control theory, and medical imaging.

### Definition

The Hilbert transform \( \mathcal{H}\{f(t)\} \) of a real-valued function \( f(t) \) is defined as the Cauchy principal value of the convolution of \( f(t) \) with \( \frac{1}{\pi t} \):

$$
\mathcal{H}\{f(t)\} = \frac{1}{\pi} \text{P.V.} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{f(\tau)}{t - \tau} \, d\tau
$$

where \( \text{P.V.} \) denotes the Cauchy principal value.

### Properties

1. **Linear Operator**: The Hilbert transform is a linear operator. If \( a \) and \( b \) are constants, and \( f(t) \) and \( g(t) \) are functions, then:
   $$
   \mathcal{H}\{a f(t) + b g(t)\} = a \mathcal{H}\{f(t)\} + b \mathcal{H}\{g(t)\}
   $$

2. **Fourier Transform Relationship**: The Hilbert transform has a simple relationship with the Fourier transform. If \( \mathcal{F}\{f(t)\} = F(\omega) \) denotes the Fourier transform of \( f(t) \), then:
   $$
   \mathcal{F}\{\mathcal{H}\{f(t)\}\} = -i \, \text{sgn}(\omega) F(\omega)
   $$
   where \( \text{sgn}(\omega) \) is the signum function:
   $$
   \text{sgn}(\omega) = \begin{cases} 
   -1 & \text{if } \omega < 0 \\
   0 & \text{if } \omega = 0 \\
   1 & \text{if } \omega > 0
   \end{cases}
   $$

3. **Involutory Property**: Applying the Hilbert transform twice results in the negative of the original function:
   $$
   \mathcal{H}\{\mathcal{H}\{f(t)\}\} = -f(t)
   $$

4. **Energy Preservation**: The Hilbert transform does not change the energy of the signal. If \( f(t) \) is square-integrable, then:
   $$
   \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |f(t)|^2 \, dt = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |\mathcal{H}\{f(t)\}|^2 \, dt
   $$

### Example: Hilbert Transform of \( \cos(\omega_0 t) \)

Consider the function \( f(t) = \cos(\omega_0 t) \).

1. **Fourier Transform of \( f(t) \)**:
   $$
   \mathcal{F}\{\cos(\omega_0 t)\} = \pi [\delta(\omega - \omega_0) + \delta(\omega + \omega_0)]
   $$

2. **Hilbert Transform**:
   Using the relationship with the Fourier transform:
   $$
   \mathcal{F}\{\mathcal{H}\{\cos(\omega_0 t)\}\} = -i \, \text{sgn}(\omega) \mathcal{F}\{\cos(\omega_0 t)\}
   $$
   Therefore:
   $$
   \mathcal{F}\{\mathcal{H}\{\cos(\omega_0 t)\}\} = -i \, \text{sgn}(\omega) [\delta(\omega - \omega_0) + \delta(\omega + \omega_0)]
   $$

3. **Inverse Fourier Transform**:
   Evaluating this, we get:
   $$
   \mathcal{H}\{\cos(\omega_0 t)\} = \sin(\omega_0 t)
   $$

Thus, the Hilbert transform of \( \cos(\omega_0 t) \) is \( \sin(\omega_0 t) \).

### Applications

1. **Signal Processing**: The Hilbert transform is used to create the analytic signal, which is essential in modulation, demodulation, and envelope detection.
2. **Instantaneous Frequency**: It helps in the computation of the instantaneous amplitude and phase of a signal.
3. **Control Theory**: Applied in the design and analysis of control systems, particularly in handling phase shifts.
4. **Medical Imaging**: Used in image reconstruction techniques such as MRI and CT scans.
5. **Communication Systems**: In amplitude modulation (AM) and single-sideband (SSB) modulation.

### Analytic Signal

The analytic signal \( s_a(t) \) of a real-valued signal \( s(t) \) is given by:
$$
s_a(t) = s(t) + i \mathcal{H}\{s(t)\}
$$

The real part of \( s_a(t) \) is the original signal, while the imaginary part is its Hilbert transform. The analytic signal is useful for extracting the instantaneous amplitude and phase of \( s(t) \).

### Example: Analytic Signal of \( \cos(\omega_0 t) \)

Consider \( s(t) = \cos(\omega_0 t) \).

1. **Hilbert Transform**: As derived above:
   $$
   \mathcal{H}\{\cos(\omega_0 t)\} = \sin(\omega_0 t)
   $$

2. **Analytic Signal**:
   $$
   s_a(t) = \cos(\omega_0 t) + i \sin(\omega_0 t) = e^{i \omega_0 t}
   $$

Thus, the analytic signal corresponding to \( \cos(\omega_0 t) \) is \( e^{i \omega_0 t} \), which has an instantaneous amplitude of 1 and an instantaneous phase of \( \omega_0 t \).

### Summary

The Hilbert transform is a powerful tool in signal processing and harmonic analysis, used to obtain the analytic representation of a signal. It has important properties and applications across various domains, including communications, control theory, and medical imaging. Understanding its properties and how to compute it is essential for many practical applications.
