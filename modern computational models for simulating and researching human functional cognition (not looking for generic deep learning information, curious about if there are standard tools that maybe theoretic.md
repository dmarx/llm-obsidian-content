**USER**

modern computational models for simulating and researching human functional cognition (not looking for generic deep learning information, curious about if there are standard tools that maybe theoretical cog sci workers use to reusably model the complexity of human information processing)


**ASSISTANT**

Modern computational models for simulating and researching human functional cognition are diverse and encompass various theoretical frameworks and practical tools. Here are some notable models and tools that are commonly used in theoretical cognitive science to model human information processing:

### 1. **ACT-R (Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational)**

**Overview:**
ACT-R is a cognitive architecture that simulates human cognition by modeling the underlying mental processes. It integrates both declarative and procedural knowledge, capturing how these types of knowledge interact to produce behavior.

**Key Features:**
- **Modules:** ACT-R is modular, with separate modules for different types of cognition (e.g., memory, visual processing, motor actions).
- **Production Rules:** Cognitive processes are represented through production rules that specify actions based on conditions.
- **Declarative Memory:** A network of chunks (units of knowledge) representing facts and events.

**Applications:**
ACT-R is widely used for modeling a variety of cognitive tasks, from simple reaction times to complex problem-solving and learning.

### 2. **SOAR**

**Overview:**
SOAR is a cognitive architecture that models general intelligence and is designed to enable a system to perform a wide range of cognitive tasks. It emphasizes the role of problem-solving and learning.

**Key Features:**
- **Universal Subgoaling:** SOAR uses a mechanism to decompose problems into subgoals.
- **Chunking:** Learning in SOAR occurs through chunking, which creates new production rules based on experience.
- **Symbolic Representation:** SOAR uses symbolic representations to model cognitive processes.

**Applications:**
SOAR has been applied in areas such as natural language understanding, robotics, and human-computer interaction.

### 3. **CLARION (Connectionist Learning with Adaptive Rule Induction ON-line)**

**Overview:**
CLARION is a hybrid cognitive architecture that combines both symbolic and subsymbolic representations. It aims to model both explicit and implicit cognitive processes.

**Key Features:**
- **Dual Representation:** Explicit (symbolic) and implicit (subsymbolic) processes are integrated.
- **Bottom-Up Learning:** Implicit knowledge can be extracted and transformed into explicit knowledge.
- **Top-Down Learning:** High-level symbolic rules can guide lower-level learning.

**Applications:**
CLARION is used to model various cognitive phenomena, including learning, reasoning, and social interaction.

### 4. **Bayesian Models of Cognition**

**Overview:**
Bayesian models use probabilistic reasoning to simulate human cognition, representing beliefs and updating them based on new evidence.

**Key Features:**
- **Probabilistic Inference:** Cognitive processes are modeled as Bayesian inference.
- **Hierarchical Models:** Complex cognitive tasks are represented using hierarchical Bayesian models.
- **Learning:** Learning is framed as updating probabilities based on observed data.

**Applications:**
Bayesian models are used in perception, language understanding, decision-making, and learning.

### 5. **Neural Network-Based Models**

**Overview:**
While deep learning models are generic, specific neural network architectures are designed to model particular cognitive functions.

**Key Features:**
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):** Useful for modeling sequential data and temporal dependencies.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Applied to visual processing and spatial data.
- **Transformer Models:** Effective for natural language processing and capturing long-range dependencies.

**Applications:**
Neural network-based models are applied in vision, language processing, memory, and attention modeling.

### Standard Tools and Frameworks

1. **PsyNeuLink**
   - A Python library for modeling cognitive processes using both neural and psychological models. It provides a flexible framework for combining different types of models.

2. **Nengo**
   - A tool for building large-scale brain models using spiking neurons and simulating neural circuits. It supports both symbolic and sub-symbolic modeling.

3. **PyCog**
   - A Python framework for creating and analyzing cognitive models, particularly focusing on decision-making and neural dynamics.

4. **Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Toolkits**
   - Toolkits like OpenViBE and BCI2000 are used to develop applications that model cognitive functions based on brain signals.

### Conclusion

These models and tools provide a robust framework for simulating and researching human cognition, addressing different aspects of cognitive processes from symbolic reasoning to probabilistic inference and neural computation. Researchers in theoretical cognitive science can leverage these tools to build, test, and refine models that capture the complexity of human information processing.
