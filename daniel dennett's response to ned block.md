Daniel Dennett's response to Ned Block


**ASSISTANT**

Daniel Dennett’s response to Ned Block's distinction between *access consciousness* (A-consciousness) and *phenomenal consciousness* (P-consciousness) is deeply critical, reflecting Dennett's broader skepticism of the concept of *qualia* and his rejection of the need for this distinction in understanding consciousness. Dennett, a leading figure in philosophy of mind, advocates for a more reductive, functionalist, and computational account of consciousness, and his critique of Block aligns with this broader framework.

### Key Points of Dennett's Response

#### 1. **Rejection of Phenomenal Consciousness (Qualia)**
Dennett is fundamentally opposed to the notion of *phenomenal consciousness* as described by Block, especially the idea that there are ineffable, subjective qualities (*qualia*) that exist beyond cognitive or functional access. Dennett sees the notion of qualia as illusory, often calling them "figments" of introspection rather than real, scientifically tractable entities. He argues that by postulating *phenomenal consciousness* as a separate kind of consciousness, Block is inviting a kind of mysticism that leads to philosophical confusion, rather than helping us understand the mind.

Dennett argues that all consciousness, including what we think of as "phenomenal" experience, can be explained in terms of cognitive access, functional roles, and behavior. In his view, subjective experience does not require an extra, special category like *P-consciousness*. Instead, it is better understood through the mechanisms that underlie access and information processing.

For Dennett, Block's distinction is akin to a philosophical trap, relying on intuitions about consciousness that Dennett believes are misguided. These intuitions, according to Dennett, are based on false dichotomies between the "appearance" and "reality" of conscious experience. In other words, Dennett is skeptical that there is a substantial difference between what seems to be happening in consciousness (what it "feels" like) and what is actually happening (what cognitive science can explain).

#### 2. **"Multiple Drafts" Model vs. Cartesian Theater**
Dennett’s *"Multiple Drafts Model"* of consciousness, outlined in his book *[[Consciousness Explained]]* (1991), serves as a direct response to theories like Block’s that rely on a sharp distinction between subjective experience (P-consciousness) and cognitive access (A-consciousness).

- **Multiple Drafts Model**: In Dennett’s account, consciousness does not occur in a central place (such as a "Cartesian Theater") where experiences are "presented" for an audience (the self). Instead, consciousness is distributed across various parallel processes in the brain, with different drafts (or versions) of conscious content being constructed and revised as information is processed. There is no single point or moment where consciousness "happens"; rather, conscious experience emerges from the competition and interaction of these drafts.
  
- **Cartesian Theater Critique**: Block’s concept of P-consciousness is, in Dennett’s view, akin to a version of the discredited "Cartesian Theater" model of consciousness—a model that assumes there is a privileged inner space where *phenomenal* experiences are presented to the mind. Dennett argues that this is an outdated and incoherent way of thinking about consciousness, since it presupposes that there is a clear divide between subjective experience and cognitive functions. In contrast, Dennett believes that all experiences are subject to revision, interpretation, and integration into behavior and cognition, and thus the need for a separate category of phenomenal consciousness dissolves.

#### 3. **Quining Qualia**
Dennett’s skepticism about *phenomenal consciousness* is best articulated in his paper *"Quining Qualia"* (1988), where he argues that *qualia*—the supposed raw, ineffable subjective qualities of experience—do not exist as real, objective entities. Dennett lists various properties that philosophers typically attribute to qualia (such as ineffability, subjectivity, and privacy) and systematically argues that none of these properties hold up under scrutiny. 

For example:
- Dennett challenges the *ineffability* of qualia, claiming that even though people often struggle to articulate their subjective experiences (like the exact nature of a color or a flavor), this does not imply the existence of private, ineffable mental states. It merely reflects the limitations of our descriptive capabilities and the limitations of language.
  
- He also critiques the idea that qualia are fundamentally private. If qualia are wholly private, they would be immune to any kind of scientific investigation or third-party validation, which leads to skepticism about whether they can even be coherently discussed in philosophy or science.

Thus, Dennett sees Block’s *P-consciousness* as essentially another manifestation of the problematic notion of *qualia*, which Dennett believes should be rejected rather than reified.

#### 4. **Dennett's Pragmatic Approach: All Consciousness is A-consciousness**
In Dennett’s view, all aspects of consciousness can be reduced to functions that can, in principle, be scientifically explained. He believes that what Block calls *phenomenal consciousness* is just a particular kind of *access consciousness*—perhaps one that is more subtle or difficult to capture, but ultimately within the scope of what cognitive science can explain. For Dennett, there are no "hard" or insurmountable aspects of consciousness that escape functional or computational explanation.

Thus, rather than endorsing a dualism between *A-consciousness* and *P-consciousness*, Dennett argues that all conscious states are simply cases of *A-consciousness*. The subjective aspects of experience (which Block attributes to P-consciousness) are, in Dennett’s framework, nothing more than features of our ability to access and use information for behavior, memory, and reasoning. He believes that once we fully understand the cognitive processes underlying access to mental content, we will have a complete understanding of consciousness.

### Summary of Dennett’s Critique
- **Phenomenal Consciousness is Redundant**: Dennett argues that Block’s distinction between *phenomenal* and *access* consciousness is unnecessary and misleading. He believes that the subjective qualities of experience (what Block calls P-consciousness) can be fully accounted for by understanding cognitive processes related to access, reportability, and behavior.
  
- **Qualia Are Illusory**: Dennett is skeptical of *qualia* and by extension, P-consciousness. He believes that these notions rest on faulty intuitions and introspection, rather than being grounded in a rigorous, functional understanding of consciousness.
  
- **Cartesian Theater Fallacy**: Dennett accuses Block of reviving the discredited idea of a *Cartesian Theater*, where experiences are somehow presented to a central observer. Dennett believes this model of consciousness is incoherent, and he proposes that consciousness should instead be understood as a distributed, dynamic process.

- **Multiple Drafts and Functionalism**: Dennett's "Multiple Drafts" model offers an alternative to Block’s distinction, suggesting that consciousness is not a single unified experience but rather a series of competing processes. In this model, there is no need for a separate category of phenomenal experience; consciousness is inherently functional and accessible.

### Conclusion
Dennett’s response to Block is grounded in his larger critique of the idea of *qualia* and his commitment to a fully naturalistic, functionalist account of consciousness. He argues that Block’s distinction between *A-consciousness* and *P-consciousness* is based on a misunderstanding of how consciousness operates. In Dennett's view, consciousness is entirely explainable in terms of access, functionality, and information processing, without invoking a separate realm of ineffable, subjective experience.
