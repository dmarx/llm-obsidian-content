# FreeSurfer Average Brain

The [[FreeSurfer average brain]] represents a standardized neuroanatomical template derived from the averaging of multiple [[structural MRI]] scans across a population of subjects. This template serves as a common reference space for [[neuroimaging analysis]] and [[cross-subject registration]].

## Mathematical Construction

The average brain is constructed through an iterative process that can be formalized as:

$\bar{B} = \mathcal{A}(\{\phi_i(B_i)\}_{i=1}^N)$

where:
- $\bar{B}$ represents the average brain template
- $B_i$ represents individual subject brain scans
- $\phi_i$ are [[spatial transformations]]
- $\mathcal{A}$ is an averaging operator
- $N$ is the number of subjects

### Registration Process

The spatial alignment process minimizes a cost function:

$\mathcal{C}(\phi) = \sum_{i=1}^N D(B_i \circ \phi_i, \bar{B}) + \alpha R(\phi_i)$

where:
- $D$ is a [[similarity metric]]
- $R$ is a [[regularization term]]
- $\alpha$ is a weighting parameter
- $\circ$ denotes function composition

## Anatomical Properties

The average brain preserves key anatomical features:

1. [[Cortical surface topology]]
   - Consistent [[sulcal patterns]]
   - Preserved [[gyral crowns]]
   
2. [[Subcortical structures]]
   - [[Basal ganglia]] positioning
   - [[Ventricular system]] architecture

## Coordinate System

The template defines a standardized coordinate system:

$\mathbf{x} = (x, y, z) \in \mathbb{R}^3$

with canonical orientations:
- $x$: left-right axis
- $y$: anterior-posterior axis
- $z$: superior-inferior axis

## Applications

Key uses include:
- [[Surface-based analysis]]
- [[Morphometric studies]]
- [[Brain parcellation]]
- [[Statistical parametric mapping]]
- [[Multi-modal integration]]

The template serves as a foundation for both [[volume-based]] and [[surface-based]] neuroimaging analyses, enabling consistent spatial normalization across studies and populations.

## Implementation

The average brain is typically stored in multiple formats:
- [[Volume representation]]: 3D matrix of intensity values
- [[Surface representation]]: Triangulated mesh of vertices and faces
- [[Label maps]]: Anatomical region identifiers
- [[Curvature maps]]: Local geometric properties

These representations facilitate different types of analyses while maintaining anatomical correspondence across modalities.
