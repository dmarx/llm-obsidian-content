Aaron Swartz was a renowned computer programmer, writer, political organizer, and internet activist, best known for his role in the development of several fundamental technologies and his advocacy for open access to information.

### Early Contributions
Swartz was involved in the creation of the RSS 1.0 specification when he was only 14 years old. He was a co-author of the specification, which is used to syndicate content on the web, enabling users to receive updates from websites in a standardized format.

### Reddit and Infogami
In 2005, Swartz co-founded the company Infogami, which later merged with Reddit, a popular social news website. This merger brought significant changes to Reddit's development and contributed to its widespread success.

### Creative Commons
Swartz also played a crucial role in the development of the Creative Commons licensing system, which allows authors to release their works with specific permissions for reuse and distribution. His contributions to the metadata framework made it easier for people to find and use Creative Commons-licensed works.

### Open Access Advocacy
Swartz's most significant impact was in the realm of open access. He was a vocal advocate for the free dissemination of academic research and public domain works. This advocacy culminated in his efforts to download a vast number of academic articles from JSTOR, leading to legal troubles.

### Legal Issues and Untimely Death
In 2011, Swartz was arrested for downloading millions of articles from JSTOR with the intention of making them freely available. He faced severe charges that could have resulted in decades of imprisonment and substantial fines. The legal pressures and potential consequences took a toll on Swartz, and he tragically took his own life on January 11, 2013, at the age of 26.

### Legacy
Swartz's legacy is profound and multifaceted. He is remembered for his technical brilliance, his unwavering commitment to freedom of information, and his significant contributions to internet culture and technology. His work continues to inspire movements for open access and the free dissemination of knowledge.
