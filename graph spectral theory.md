# Graph Spectral Theory

[[Graph spectral theory]] is the study of the properties of a graph through the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices associated with that graph. It bridges [[algebraic graph theory]], [[linear algebra]], and [[spectral analysis]] to provide powerful tools for analyzing network structures and dynamics.

## Fundamental Matrices

### Adjacency Matrix

The [[adjacency matrix]] $A = [a_{ij}]$ of a graph $G = (V, E)$ with $n$ vertices is defined as:

$$a_{ij} = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } (i,j) \in E \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

For weighted graphs:

$$a_{ij} = \begin{cases}
w_{ij} & \text{if } (i,j) \in E \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

where $w_{ij}$ is the weight of edge $(i,j)$.

Properties:
- Symmetric for undirected graphs
- Eigenvalues are real for undirected graphs
- Spectrum is bounded by $-d_{max} \leq \lambda_i \leq d_{max}$, where $d_{max}$ is the maximum degree

### Laplacian Matrix

The [[Laplacian matrix]] $L = [l_{ij}]$ is defined as:

$$L = D - A$$

where $D = \text{diag}(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n)$ is the degree matrix.

Elementwise:

$$l_{ij} = \begin{cases}
d_i & \text{if } i = j \\
-1 & \text{if } (i,j) \in E \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

Properties:
- Positive semidefinite
- The smallest eigenvalue is always zero
- The multiplicity of the zero eigenvalue equals the number of connected components
- Spectrum is bounded by $0 \leq \lambda_i \leq 2d_{max}$

### Normalized Laplacian

The [[normalized Laplacian]] $\mathcal{L} = [\mathcal{l}_{ij}]$ is defined as:

$$\mathcal{L} = D^{-1/2} L D^{-1/2}$$

Elementwise:

$$\mathcal{l}_{ij} = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } i = j \text{ and } d_i \neq 0 \\
-\frac{1}{\sqrt{d_i d_j}} & \text{if } (i,j) \in E \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

Properties:
- Eigenvalues are in [0, 2]
- The spectrum is independent of vertex scaling
- For regular graphs, the eigenvalues of $\mathcal{L}$ are linearly related to those of $A$

### Signless Laplacian

The [[signless Laplacian]] $Q = [q_{ij}]$ is defined as:

$$Q = D + A$$

Properties:
- Positive semidefinite
- Complements the information in the standard Laplacian
- Useful for bipartiteness analysis

### Transition Matrix

The [[transition matrix]] $P = [p_{ij}]$ represents random walk probabilities:

$$P = D^{-1}A$$

Properties:
- Stochastic matrix (rows sum to 1)
- Largest eigenvalue is 1
- Eigenvalues are between -1 and 1

## Spectral Properties

### Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

For any matrix $M$ associated with a graph:
- Eigenvalues $\lambda_i$ satisfy $M\mathbf{v}_i = \lambda_i \mathbf{v}_i$
- Eigenvectors $\mathbf{v}_i$ provide spatial information
- The [[spectrum]] is the multiset of eigenvalues: $\text{Spec}(M) = \{\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \ldots, \lambda_n\}$

### Spectral Gap

The [[spectral gap]] is the difference between the two largest eigenvalues:

$$\Delta = |\lambda_1 - \lambda_2|$$

For the Laplacian, the spectral gap is the second-smallest eigenvalue $\lambda_2$, also known as the [[algebraic connectivity]] or [[Fiedler value]].

Properties:
- Larger gap indicates better connectivity
- Bounds mixing time of random walks
- Relates to [[isoperimetric number]] and [[expansion properties]]

### Spectral Radius

The [[spectral radius]] $\rho(M)$ is the largest absolute eigenvalue:

$$\rho(M) = \max_i |\lambda_i|$$

Properties:
- For adjacency matrix, relates to maximum degree and average degree
- Bounds on various combinatorial graph properties
- Indicator of global network structure

### Spectral Moments

The [[spectral moments]] $\mu_k$ are:

$$\mu_k = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i^k = \frac{1}{n} \text{Tr}(M^k)$$

Properties:
- $\mu_1$ relates to average degree
- $\mu_2$ gives edge density information
- Higher moments characterize subgraph distributions

## Applications

### Graph Partitioning

[[Spectral clustering]] uses eigenvectors for partitioning:
1. Compute the Laplacian matrix
2. Find eigenvectors corresponding to the smallest non-zero eigenvalues
3. Cluster nodes based on their coordinates in the eigenvector space

The [[Fiedler vector]] (eigenvector of $\lambda_2$ of the Laplacian) provides an optimal linear layout of the graph.

### Community Detection

Spectral properties reveal community structure:
- Multiple eigenvectors capture hierarchical community structures
- [[Modularity matrix]] eigenvalues quantify community strength
- [[Spectral modularity maximization]] optimizes community detection

### Graph Drawing

[[Spectral layout]] algorithms use eigenvectors for visualization:
- Laplacian eigenmaps minimize edge lengths
- Adjacency eigenvectors optimize certain energy functions
- Normalized Laplacian eigenvectors reduce distortion

### Random Walks

The transition matrix spectrum characterizes random walks:
- [[Mixing time]] is governed by $\frac{1}{1-\lambda_2(P)}$
- [[Hitting time]] is related to effective resistance
- [[Cover time]] has bounds based on spectral properties

### Diffusion Processes

The Laplacian governs diffusion processes:
- [[Heat equation]] on graphs: $\frac{d\mathbf{f}}{dt} = -L\mathbf{f}$
- [[Diffusion distance]] between nodes
- [[Diffusion maps]] for dimensionality reduction

### Network Robustness

Spectral analysis assesses network robustness:
- [[Algebraic connectivity]] measures node/edge connectivity
- [[Spectral radius]] relates to [[epidemic threshold]]
- [[Eigenvalue perturbation]] predicts failure impact

## Spectral Graph Theory for Specific Graph Classes

### Complete Graphs

For the complete graph $K_n$:
- Adjacency spectrum: $\{n-1, -1, -1, \ldots, -1\}$
- Laplacian spectrum: $\{n, n, \ldots, n, 0\}$
- Normalized Laplacian spectrum: $\{1, 1, \ldots, 1, 0\}$

### Regular Graphs

For $d$-regular graphs:
- Max adjacency eigenvalue is $d$
- Laplacian eigenvalues $\lambda_i(L) = d - \lambda_i(A)$
- Normalized Laplacian eigenvalues $\lambda_i(\mathcal{L}) = 1 - \frac{\lambda_i(A)}{d}$

### Bipartite Graphs

For bipartite graphs:
- Adjacency spectrum is symmetric about zero
- Signless Laplacian's smallest eigenvalue approaches zero
- Spectral radius relates to [[Lovász local lemma]]

### Random Graphs

For [[Erdős-Rényi random graphs]] $G(n,p)$:
- Adjacency spectral radius ≈ $np$ for large $n$
- Bulk eigenvalues follow the [[semicircle law]]
- Isolated eigenvalues provide structural information

## Spectral Graph Theory Theorems

### Perron-Frobenius Theorem

For connected graphs:
- The largest eigenvalue of $A$ is simple (multiplicity 1)
- The corresponding eigenvector has all positive entries
- This principal eigenvector gives a centrality measure

### Cheeger's Inequality

Relates the isoperimetric number $h(G)$ to the spectral gap:

$$\frac{\lambda_2}{2} \leq h(G) \leq \sqrt{2\lambda_2}$$

### Expander Mixing Lemma

For a $d$-regular graph, for any sets $S, T \subset V$:

$$\left|e(S,T) - \frac{d|S||T|}{n}\right| \leq \lambda \sqrt{|S||T|}$$

where $\lambda$ is the second-largest eigenvalue in absolute value.

### Interlacing Theorem

If $H$ is an induced subgraph of $G$ with $n-1$ vertices:

$$\lambda_i(G) \leq \lambda_i(H) \leq \lambda_{i+1}(G)$$

for $i = 1, 2, \ldots, n-1$.

## Advanced Topics

### Matrix Functions

[[Matrix functions]] $f(M)$ apply scalar functions to eigenvalues:

$$f(M) = U f(\Lambda) U^{-1}$$

Examples:
- [[Matrix exponential]]: $e^{-tL}$ for heat diffusion
- [[Resolvent]]: $(M - zI)^{-1}$ for Green's functions
- [[Matrix square root]]: $M^{1/2}$ for normalization

### Spectral Sparsification

[[Spectral sparsification]] creates sparse approximations $H$ of graph $G$ such that:

$$(1-\epsilon)L_G \preceq L_H \preceq (1+\epsilon)L_G$$

in the [[positive semidefinite ordering]].

### Quantum Walks

[[Quantum walks]] on graphs are governed by the [[Schrödinger equation]]:

$$i\frac{d\psi}{dt} = H\psi$$

where $H$ is typically derived from the adjacency or Laplacian matrix.

### Non-backtracking Matrix

The [[non-backtracking matrix]] $B$ represents walks that don't immediately backtrack:

$$B_{(i,j),(k,l)} = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } j = k \text{ and } i \neq l \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

Properties:
- Improves community detection in sparse networks
- Relates to the [[Ihara zeta function]]
- Spectral radius governs phase transitions

### Spectral Dimension

The [[spectral dimension]] $d_s$ is defined via the heat kernel trace:

$$\text{Tr}(e^{-tL}) \sim t^{-d_s/2} \text{ as } t \rightarrow \infty$$

This generalizes the notion of dimension to irregular structures.

## Mathematical Formalism

The spectral theory of graphs can be formalized using:

1. **Functional Analysis**: Viewing graph operators as bounded linear operators on Hilbert spaces
2. **Representation Theory**: Using graph spectra to study automorphism groups
3. **Algebraic Geometry**: Connecting graph spectra to algebraic varieties

## Symbolic Notation

To standardize spectral graph theory notation:

- $G = (V, E)$: Graph with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$
- $n = |V|$, $m = |E|$: Number of vertices and edges
- $A$: Adjacency matrix
- $L = D - A$: Laplacian matrix
- $\mathcal{L} = D^{-1/2}LD^{-1/2}$: Normalized Laplacian
- $Q = D + A$: Signless Laplacian
- $P = D^{-1}A$: Transition matrix
- $\lambda_i(M)$: The $i$-th eigenvalue of matrix $M$
- $\mathbf{v}_i(M)$: The eigenvector corresponding to $\lambda_i(M)$
- $\sigma(M) = \{\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \ldots, \lambda_n\}$: Spectrum of $M$
- $\rho(M) = \max_i |\lambda_i(M)|$: Spectral radius of $M$

This notation allows for concise expression of spectral graph properties and theorems.
