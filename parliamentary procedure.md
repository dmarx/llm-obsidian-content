### Parliamentary Procedure

Parliamentary procedure refers to the body of rules, ethics, and customs governing meetings and other operations of clubs, organizations, legislative bodies, and other deliberative assemblies. The goal of parliamentary procedure is to facilitate the orderly conduct of business, ensure fairness and equality among members, and protect the rights of the minority.

#### Core Principles

1. **Democratic Rule**: All members have the right to participate, speak, and vote.
2. **Orderly Debate**: Structured discussion ensures that all views can be heard.
3. **Majority Rule**: Decisions are generally made by majority vote.
4. **Minority Rights**: Minority opinions must be heard and considered.

#### Key Elements

1. **Motions**: Proposals put forward for consideration. They can be categorized as:
   - **Main Motions**: Introduce new business.
   - **Subsidiary Motions**: Modify or dispose of the main motion (e.g., amend, table).
   - **Privileged Motions**: Deal with urgent matters not related to the main business (e.g., adjourn, recess).
   - **Incidental Motions**: Address procedural issues arising from other motions (e.g., point of order, appeal).

2. **Debate**: Members discuss motions according to specific rules:
   - **Recognition**: Members must be recognized by the chair before speaking.
   - **Limits**: Time and frequency limits on speeches ensure efficiency and fairness.

3. **Voting**: Various methods ensure accurate representation of members' decisions:
   - **Voice Vote**: Members verbally express their vote.
   - **Roll Call Vote**: Members' votes are recorded individually.
   - **Secret Ballot**: Votes are cast anonymously.

4. **Quorum**: The minimum number of members required to be present for the meeting to conduct business. This number is usually defined by the organizationâ€™s bylaws.

#### Meeting Structure

1. **Call to Order**: The chairperson formally starts the meeting.
2. **Approval of Minutes**: Members approve the record of the previous meeting.
3. **Reports**: Officers and committees present their reports.
4. **Unfinished Business**: Address any business carried over from previous meetings.
5. **New Business**: Introduce and discuss new topics.
6. **Adjournment**: The meeting formally ends.

#### Parliamentary Authorities

Different organizations may follow different sets of rules, known as parliamentary authorities. Some common ones include:

1. **Robert's Rules of Order**: The most widely used manual in the United States, providing a comprehensive set of rules for meetings and organizations.
2. **The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure** (Sturgis): Offers simplified rules and is often preferred by smaller organizations.
3. **Demeter's Manual of Parliamentary Law and Procedure**: Used by some organizations for its detailed explanations and examples.
4. **Mason's Manual of Legislative Procedure**: Commonly used by state legislatures in the United States.

#### Practical Application

Parliamentary procedure is essential in various settings to ensure that meetings run smoothly and decisions are made democratically. It is used in:

- Legislative bodies
- Corporate boards
- Nonprofit organizations
- Academic institutions
- Civic and community groups

Understanding and applying parliamentary procedure helps members navigate meetings effectively, ensures fairness, and facilitates the efficient conduct of business.

For detailed guidelines and specific rules, refer to the appropriate parliamentary authority or a certified parliamentarian.
