### Introduction to Lie Theory

Lie theory is a branch of mathematics that studies continuous symmetries, represented by groups and their associated algebras. These structures play a crucial role in many areas of mathematics and theoretical physics.

### Lie Groups

A **Lie group** is a group that is also a smooth manifold, where the group operations (multiplication and inversion) are smooth maps. Formally, a Lie group $G$ is defined such that:
1. $G$ is a group.
2. $G$ is a smooth manifold.
3. The group operations $m: G \times G \to G$ (multiplication) and $i: G \to G$ (inversion) are smooth maps.

#### Examples
- **Real numbers** $\mathbb{R}$ under addition.
- **General Linear Group** $GL(n, \mathbb{R})$: The group of all $n \times n$ invertible matrices with real entries.

### Lie Algebras

Associated with each Lie group is a Lie algebra, which can be thought of as the tangent space at the identity element equipped with a special structure called the **Lie bracket**. For a Lie group $G$, its Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ is the tangent space at the identity $e \in G$, denoted $T_e G$, with the Lie bracket defined as:
$$ [X, Y] = XY - YX $$
for $X, Y \in \mathfrak{g}$, where $XY$ denotes the product of the vector fields $X$ and $Y$.

#### Properties
1. **Bilinearity**: $[aX + bY, Z] = a[X, Z] + b[Y, Z]$ for all $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$.
2. **Alternativity**: $[X, X] = 0$ for all $X \in \mathfrak{g}$.
3. **Jacobi identity**: $[X, [Y, Z]] + [Y, [Z, X]] + [Z, [X, Y]] = 0$ for all $X, Y, Z \in \mathfrak{g}$.

### Lie Group and Lie Algebra Homomorphisms

A **homomorphism** between two Lie groups $G$ and $H$ is a smooth map $\phi: G \to H$ that respects the group operations:
$$ \phi(g_1 g_2) = \phi(g_1) \phi(g_2) \text{ for all } g_1, g_2 \in G. $$

Similarly, a homomorphism between two Lie algebras $\mathfrak{g}$ and $\mathfrak{h}$ is a linear map $\psi: \mathfrak{g} \to \mathfrak{h}$ that respects the Lie bracket:
$$ \psi([X, Y]) = [\psi(X), \psi(Y)] \text{ for all } X, Y \in \mathfrak{g}. $$

### Structure Theory of Lie Algebras

#### Cartan Subalgebra
A **Cartan subalgebra** $\mathfrak{h}$ of a Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ is a maximal abelian subalgebra such that every element is semisimple (diagonalizable over the complex numbers).

#### Root Systems
Given a Cartan subalgebra $\mathfrak{h}$ of $\mathfrak{g}$, the **[[root system]]** $\Phi$ consists of non-zero weights (roots) $\alpha \in \mathfrak{h}^*$ such that:
$$ \mathfrak{g}_\alpha = \{ X \in \mathfrak{g} \mid [H, X] = \alpha(H)X \text{ for all } H \in \mathfrak{h} \} $$
is non-trivial. The space $\mathfrak{g}_\alpha$ is called the root space associated with $\alpha$.

### Representation Theory

**Representation theory** studies how Lie groups and Lie algebras can act on vector spaces. A **representation** of a Lie group $G$ on a vector space $V$ is a homomorphism $\rho: G \to GL(V)$, where $GL(V)$ is the group of invertible linear transformations on $V$.

For Lie algebras, a representation $\rho$ of a Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ on a vector space $V$ is a homomorphism $\rho: \mathfrak{g} \to \mathfrak{gl}(V)$, where $\mathfrak{gl}(V)$ is the Lie algebra of all endomorphisms of $V$.

### Applications

Lie theory has applications in many areas, including:
- **Differential equations**: Solutions to differential equations can often be understood in terms of the symmetry groups of the equations.
- **Theoretical physics**: Lie groups and Lie algebras are fundamental in the study of particle physics and quantum mechanics, particularly in the formulation of symmetries and conservation laws.
- **Geometry**: Lie groups serve as transformation groups for various geometric structures, providing insights into the geometry of manifolds.
