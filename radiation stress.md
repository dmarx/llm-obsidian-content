### Radiation Stress

**Radiation stress** is a concept in coastal and ocean engineering that represents the excess momentum flux in a fluid (typically water) due to the presence of waves. It quantifies the momentum transfer within the water column caused by wave motion and is crucial in understanding wave-induced currents, setup, and the overall impact of waves on coastal environments.

### Key Concepts

1. **Wave-Induced Momentum**:
   - **Definition**: Radiation stress is the additional momentum per unit area in a fluid that arises due to wave motion. It is essentially the momentum transfer associated with the presence of waves compared to a situation with no waves.
   - **Mechanism**: As waves propagate, they carry energy and momentum. The variations in wave energy and momentum across space and time generate gradients in radiation stress, which can drive currents and cause changes in mean sea level ([[wave setup]] and setdown).

2. **Components of Radiation Stress**:
   - **Normal and Tangential Components**: Radiation stress can be decomposed into components acting normal to and tangential to the wave crest. For a wave propagating in the \(x\)-direction:
     - \( S_{xx} \): Radiation stress component in the direction of wave propagation (along the \(x\)-axis).
     - \( S_{yy} \): Radiation stress component perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation (along the \(y\)-axis).
     - \( S_{xy} = S_{yx} \): Shear stress components that represent the tangential force exerted by the waves.
   - **Mathematical Formulation**: For linear waves in shallow water, the radiation stress tensor \( S_{ij} \) can be expressed as:
     $$
     S_{xx} = \left(E + \frac{1}{2} \rho g H^2\right) \cos^2 \theta + \frac{1}{2} \rho g H^2
     $$
     $$
     S_{yy} = \left(E + \frac{1}{2} \rho g H^2\right) \sin^2 \theta + \frac{1}{2} \rho g H^2
     $$
     $$
     S_{xy} = \left(E + \frac{1}{2} \rho g H^2\right) \sin\theta \cos\theta
     $$
     where:
     - \( E \) is the wave energy density,
     - \( H \) is the wave height,
     - \( \rho \) is the fluid density,
     - \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity,
     - \( \theta \) is the angle of wave propagation relative to the \( x \)-axis.

3. **Wave Setup and Setdown**:
   - **Wave Setup**: The increase in mean water level due to the onshore-directed radiation stress gradient as waves approach the shore. Wave setup leads to a higher water level near the coast, contributing to coastal flooding during storms.
   - **Wave Setdown**: The decrease in mean water level in the region offshore from where waves break, associated with a decrease in radiation stress.

4. **Importance in Coastal Dynamics**:
   - **Wave-Driven Currents**: Radiation stress gradients are a primary driver of wave-induced currents, such as longshore currents and rip currents, which play a crucial role in sediment transport and beach morphology.
   - **Storm Surges and Coastal Erosion**: During storms, radiation stress contributes to storm surges and enhances coastal erosion by raising water levels and intensifying wave-driven flows.

### Mathematical Formulation

1. **Wave Energy and Radiation Stress**:
   - **Wave Energy Density \( E \)**: The wave energy density is given by:
     $$
     E = \frac{1}{8} \rho g H^2
     $$
     where \( H \) is the wave height. The total energy flux associated with the waves is related to the group velocity \( c_g \) and the energy density \( E \).
   - **Radiation Stress Tensor**: The components of the radiation stress tensor \( S_{ij} \) describe the flux of momentum due to the waves in different directions. For small-amplitude waves, this tensor is related to the energy flux as described above.

2. **Wave-Driven Currents**:
   - **Momentum Balance**: The momentum balance in the water column is affected by gradients in radiation stress. The equation of motion considering radiation stress can be expressed as:
     $$
     \rho \frac{\partial \mathbf{U}}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \mathbf{S} + \rho g \nabla \zeta = 0
     $$
     where:
     - \( \mathbf{U} \) is the mean flow velocity,
     - \( \mathbf{S} \) is the radiation stress tensor,
     - \( \zeta \) is the free surface elevation.
   - **Wave Setup Equation**: The [[wave setup]] can be derived from the balance between the pressure gradient force and the radiation stress gradient. In one dimension, the setup \( \zeta(x) \) is given by:
     $$
     \frac{\partial \zeta}{\partial x} = -\frac{1}{\rho g} \frac{\partial S_{xx}}{\partial x}
     $$
     showing that [[wave setup]] occurs where the radiation stress increases in the shoreward direction.

3. **Energy Flux and Wave Action**:
   - **Wave Action Conservation**: The conservation of wave action in the presence of varying water depth and currents is closely related to radiation stress. Wave action \( A = E / \omega \), where \( \omega \) is the wave frequency, is conserved in the absence of external forces, but its flux is modified by gradients in radiation stress.

### Applications of Radiation Stress

1. **Coastal Engineering**:
   - **Design of Coastal Structures**: Understanding radiation stress is crucial for designing coastal structures like seawalls, jetties, and breakwaters. These structures must be designed to withstand the forces exerted by wave-induced radiation stress and to minimize adverse impacts like erosion.
   - **Beach Nourishment**: Radiation stress is also important in beach nourishment projects, where artificial sand is added to eroding beaches. The wave-driven currents influenced by radiation stress determine how the sand will be redistributed along the coast.

2. **Environmental Impact Assessments**:
   - **Impact on Ecosystems**: Changes in radiation stress due to human interventions, such as coastal construction or dredging, can affect coastal ecosystems by altering wave-driven currents and sediment transport patterns.
   - **Flood Risk Management**: Radiation stress plays a key role in predicting coastal flooding, particularly during extreme weather events. Accurate assessments of [[wave setup]] are essential for managing flood risks and designing effective coastal defenses.

3. **Numerical Modeling in Oceanography**:
   - **Coastal Models**: Radiation stress is a key parameter in numerical models used to simulate coastal and oceanographic processes. Models such as the SWAN (Simulating WAves Nearshore) and ROMS (Regional Ocean Modeling System) incorporate radiation stress to predict wave-driven currents, [[wave setup]], and coastal sediment dynamics.

### Conclusion

**Radiation stress** is a fundamental concept in coastal and ocean engineering that quantifies the additional momentum flux due to waves. It is essential for understanding and predicting the impacts of waves on coastal currents, [[wave setup]], and sediment transport. By influencing wave-driven processes, radiation stress plays a crucial role in coastal erosion, beach morphology, and the design of coastal protection structures. Advances in the mathematical formulation and numerical modeling of radiation stress continue to enhance our ability to manage and protect coastal environments in the face of natural and human-induced changes.
