**USER**

on the human experience of "excited by risk"


**ASSISTANT**

The user is asking me to write a wiki entry for a technical knowledge base focused on AI research, ML, applied mathematics, and philosophy of mind. The topic is "the human experience of 'excited by risk'".

Key requirements:
1. Write as a wiki page, not conversational
2. Use double brackets for wiki-style links for novel terms
3. Provide deeply detailed, technical explanations
4. Include mathematical formalisms when relevant
5. Be accessible to someone with graduate degrees in applied math, stats, and philosophy of science
6. Accompany physics notation with accessible mathematical formalization
7. Propose symbolic notation for modeling the topic
8. Don't acknowledge the interaction - just provide wiki content

The topic "excited by risk" relates to psychology, neuroscience, decision theory, and potentially computational models of human behavior. I should cover:

- Neurological basis (dopamine, reward systems)
- Mathematical models of risk preference
- Behavioral economics perspectives
- Computational approaches
- Philosophical implications for agency and decision-making
- Potential symbolic notation for modeling this phenomenon

I should structure this as a comprehensive wiki entry with technical depth appropriate for the target audience.# Risk Excitement: Computational Models of Positive Risk Valence

## Overview

[[Risk excitement]] represents a distinct psychological phenomenon where individuals experience positive [[affective valence]] in response to uncertainty and potential negative outcomes. This diverges from classical [[expected utility theory]], which typically models risk as inherently aversive through [[risk aversion]] parameters.

## Neurobiological Substrate

The experience of risk excitement emerges from the interaction between multiple neural circuits, primarily involving the [[mesolimbic dopamine system]] and the [[anterior cingulate cortex]]. The [[ventral tegmental area]] (VTA) exhibits increased firing rates in response to uncertain reward schedules, following what can be modeled as a [[prediction error signal]]:

```
δ(t) = r(t) + γV(s_{t+1}) - V(s_t)
```

Where δ(t) represents the [[temporal difference error]], r(t) is the immediate reward, γ is the discount factor, and V(s) represents the [[state value function]]. Risk excitement occurs when the variance of δ(t) itself becomes a source of positive utility.

## Mathematical Formalization

### Risk-Seeking Utility Function

Classical [[von Neumann-Morgenstern utility]] assumes risk aversion through concave utility functions. Risk excitement can be modeled through a modified utility function incorporating a [[variance preference parameter]]:

```
U(X) = E[u(x)] + ψ · Var(u(x))
```

Where:
- X is a risky prospect
- u(x) is the base utility function
- ψ > 0 represents the [[risk excitement coefficient]]
- Var(u(x)) captures the variance in utility outcomes

### Probability Weighting in Risk Excitement

Building on [[cumulative prospect theory]], risk excitement involves systematic distortion of probability weights. The [[probability weighting function]] can be extended:

```
w(p) = p^α / (p^α + (1-p)^α)^(1/α) + β · H(p)
```

Where H(p) = -p log(p) - (1-p) log(1-p) represents the [[Shannon entropy]] of the probability distribution, and β > 0 captures the excitement derived from uncertainty itself.

## Computational Models

### Reinforcement Learning with Excitement

Standard [[Q-learning]] can be modified to incorporate risk excitement through an [[intrinsic motivation]] term:

```
Q(s,a) ← Q(s,a) + α[r + γ max_a' Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)] + λ · σ²(Q(s,·))
```

Where σ²(Q(s,·)) represents the variance across action values, and λ > 0 is the [[exploration bonus coefficient]] representing intrinsic excitement from uncertainty.

### Information-Theoretic Approach

Risk excitement can be conceptualized through [[information theory]], where agents derive utility from information gain. The [[mutual information]] between actions and outcomes becomes a source of value:

```
I(A;O) = Σ_a Σ_o p(a,o) log[p(a,o) / (p(a)p(o))]
```

Agents exhibiting risk excitement maximize:

```
U_total = E[u(outcome)] + κ · I(Action;Outcome)
```

Where κ represents the [[information value coefficient]].

## Dynamical Systems Perspective

Risk excitement can emerge from the [[attractor dynamics]] of decision-making systems. Consider the phase space of a decision system with coordinates representing [[commitment strength]] c and [[uncertainty level]] u:

```
dc/dt = f(c,u,θ)
du/dt = g(c,u,θ)
```

Where θ represents individual difference parameters. Risk-excited individuals exhibit [[bistable dynamics]] with attractors at both high-certainty/high-commitment and high-uncertainty/high-excitement states.

## Cognitive Architecture Implications

### Dual-Process Models

Risk excitement suggests a modification to [[dual-process theories]] of cognition. The traditional [[System 1]]/[[System 2]] dichotomy requires extension to include a [[System X]] specialized for uncertainty navigation:

- **System 1**: Fast, automatic, risk-averse
- **System 2**: Slow, deliberative, expected utility maximization  
- **System X**: Fast, automatic, uncertainty-seeking

### Metacognitive Monitoring

Risk excitement involves [[metacognitive]] processes that monitor and value the act of decision-making under uncertainty. This can be formalized through a [[higher-order monitoring system]]:

```
M(t) = monitor(confidence(decision(t)), uncertainty(environment(t)))
```

Where the monitoring function M(t) generates positive [[metacognitive feelings]] when uncertainty is high and confidence is moderate.

## Philosophical Implications

### Agency and Authenticity

Risk excitement raises questions about the nature of [[rational agency]]. If individuals derive genuine utility from uncertainty itself, this challenges normative models that equate rationality with [[risk minimization]]. The phenomenon suggests that [[authentic choice]] may require some degree of uncertainty preservation.

### Existential Dimensions

From an [[existentialist]] perspective, risk excitement reflects the fundamental human capacity for [[transcendence]] of deterministic constraint. The mathematical modeling of this phenomenon must account for the irreducible [[phenomenological]] dimension of lived uncertainty.

## Symbolic Notation Proposal

Let Ψ represent the complete risk excitement operator:

```
Ψ[X,θ] = E[u(X)] + θ_var · Var(X) + θ_info · H(X) + θ_meta · M(X)
```

Where:
- θ_var: variance preference parameter
- θ_info: information value parameter  
- θ_meta: metacognitive excitement parameter
- H(X): entropy of prospect X
- M(X): metacognitive monitoring value

This unified notation captures the multi-dimensional nature of risk excitement across [[affective]], [[cognitive]], and [[metacognitive]] levels.

## Research Directions

Current gaps include:
- [[Individual differences]] in θ parameters
- [[Developmental trajectories]] of risk excitement
- [[Cultural variation]] in uncertainty valuation
- [[Computational implementation]] in artificial agents
- [[Therapeutic interventions]] for maladaptive risk excitement
