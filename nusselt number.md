Nusselt number


**ASSISTANT**

The **Nusselt number** ($Nu$) is a dimensionless number that characterizes the relative contribution of **convection** to **conduction** in heat transfer across a fluid. It is a key parameter in quantifying the efficiency of convective heat transfer in systems such as boundary layers, pipes, and heat exchangers.

### Definition of the Nusselt Number

The Nusselt number is defined as:
$$
Nu = \frac{h L}{\lambda}
$$
where:
- $h$ is the **convective heat transfer coefficient** (W/m²·K),
- $L$ is a **characteristic length** (e.g., diameter of a pipe, length of a plate),
- $\lambda$ is the **thermal conductivity** of the fluid (W/m·K).

Alternatively, it can be written in terms of heat flux:
$$
Nu = \frac{q}{\left(\frac{\lambda}{L} (T_s - T_\infty)\right)}
$$
where:
- $q$ is the heat flux from the surface,
- $T_s$ is the surface temperature,
- $T_\infty$ is the temperature of the free stream (fluid far from the surface).

In essence, the Nusselt number quantifies the ratio of **convective heat transfer** (enhanced by fluid motion) to **purely conductive heat transfer** (which would occur if the fluid were stationary).

### Physical Interpretation

- **$Nu = 1$**: Heat is transferred purely by conduction, meaning there is no convective enhancement.
- **$Nu > 1$**: Convection is contributing to the heat transfer, with the Nusselt number indicating how much more efficient convection is compared to conduction.
  - A larger Nusselt number signifies more efficient convective heat transfer.

### Applications of the Nusselt Number

The Nusselt number is widely used in practical applications to estimate the heat transfer rate in systems where convection plays a role, such as cooling systems, boilers, heat exchangers, and flows over surfaces.

It helps engineers design efficient thermal systems by relating the heat transfer to flow conditions and surface properties. The Nusselt number also appears in dimensionless correlations used to predict heat transfer in different flow regimes, including laminar and turbulent flows.

### Empirical Correlations for the Nusselt Number

The Nusselt number is often determined using empirical correlations that depend on other dimensionless numbers such as the **Reynolds number** ($Re$) and **Prandtl number** ($Pr$), which capture the nature of the flow and thermal properties of the fluid.

#### 1. **Laminar Flow (Forced Convection)**

For **laminar flow** over a flat plate, the local Nusselt number can be approximated as:
$$
Nu_x = 0.332 Re_x^{1/2} Pr^{1/3}
$$
where:
- $Nu_x$ is the local Nusselt number at distance $x$ from the leading edge of the plate,
- $Re_x = \frac{\rho u x}{\mu}$ is the local Reynolds number based on distance $x$,
- $Pr$ is the Prandtl number.

For fully developed laminar flow inside a pipe, the Nusselt number is approximately constant:
$$
Nu = 3.66
$$
This value applies when the flow is fully developed and the walls are maintained at a constant temperature.

#### 2. **Turbulent Flow (Forced Convection)**

In **turbulent flow**, convective heat transfer is much more effective due to the mixing induced by turbulence. A commonly used correlation for the Nusselt number in turbulent flow inside a pipe is the **Dittus-Boelter equation**:
$$
Nu = 0.023 Re^{0.8} Pr^n
$$
where:
- $n = 0.3$ for heating (fluid temperature increases),
- $n = 0.4$ for cooling (fluid temperature decreases).

This correlation is valid for a range of Reynolds numbers and Prandtl numbers, particularly for $0.7 < Pr < 160$ and $Re > 10^4$.

#### 3. **Natural Convection**

For **natural convection**, where fluid motion is driven by buoyancy forces rather than external means, the Nusselt number depends on the **Rayleigh number** ($Ra$), which combines the effects of the Grashof number (buoyancy vs. viscous forces) and the Prandtl number:
$$
Ra = Gr \cdot Pr
$$
For vertical plates in natural convection, an empirical correlation for the average Nusselt number is:
$$
Nu = C \cdot Ra^n
$$
where $C$ and $n$ are constants that depend on the Rayleigh number range and the geometry of the system.

For example, for air over a vertical plate:
$$
Nu = 0.68 + \frac{0.67 Ra_L^{1/4}}{[1 + (0.492 / Pr)^{9/16}]^{4/9}}
$$
where $Ra_L$ is the Rayleigh number based on the plate length.

### Practical Importance of the Nusselt Number

1. **Heat Exchanger Design**: The Nusselt number is used to calculate the heat transfer rate between fluids in heat exchangers. By determining the convective heat transfer coefficient from the Nusselt number, engineers can optimize the surface area and fluid flow rates to achieve desired heat transfer goals.

2. **Boundary Layer Analysis**: The Nusselt number is critical in analyzing the thermal boundary layer development over surfaces. In laminar flow, the Nusselt number can be used to estimate the heat transfer in the boundary layer, while in turbulent flow, it helps quantify the enhanced heat transfer due to eddies.

3. **Pipe Flow**: In internal flow systems like pipes, the Nusselt number governs the rate of heat transfer between the pipe wall and the fluid. This is crucial in systems such as HVAC, chemical reactors, and thermal management systems.

4. **Natural Convection Systems**: For systems relying on natural convection (e.g., electronics cooling, solar panels), the Nusselt number allows designers to estimate heat transfer based solely on temperature differences and buoyancy-driven fluid motion.

### Summary

The **Nusselt number** ($Nu$) is a dimensionless number that quantifies the ratio of convective to conductive heat transfer in fluid systems. It is a critical parameter in predicting and optimizing heat transfer in forced and natural convection systems. By using empirical correlations and dimensionless analysis (such as the Reynolds and Prandtl numbers), the Nusselt number allows engineers to design efficient thermal systems for a wide range of applications.

**USER**

Nusselt number


**ASSISTANT**

The **Nusselt number** (\(Nu\)) is a dimensionless number used in heat transfer to characterize the ratio of convective to conductive heat transfer across a boundary in a fluid. It is named after the German engineer Wilhelm Nusselt, who made significant contributions to the study of convective heat transfer.

### 1. **Definition of Nusselt Number**

The Nusselt number is defined as:

$$
Nu = \frac{hL}{k},
$$

where:
- \( h \) is the convective heat transfer coefficient (W/m²·K).
- \( L \) is the characteristic length scale (m), which could be the length of a plate, diameter of a pipe, or other relevant dimension.
- \( k \) is the thermal conductivity of the fluid (W/m·K).

Alternatively, the Nusselt number can be expressed as the ratio of the total heat transfer (convection) to the heat transfer by conduction alone:

$$
Nu = \frac{\text{Total heat transfer}}{\text{Heat transfer by conduction alone}}.
$$

### 2. **Physical Interpretation**

The Nusselt number quantifies the enhancement of heat transfer due to convection relative to pure conduction:

- **\(Nu = 1\)**: Heat transfer occurs purely by conduction, without any convective enhancement.
- **\(Nu > 1\)**: Convection enhances heat transfer, with larger values of \(Nu\) indicating a stronger convective effect relative to conduction.

### 3. **Applications of Nusselt Number**

The Nusselt number is widely used in the design and analysis of heat transfer systems, including:

#### **Heat Exchanger Design**
- The Nusselt number is crucial in determining the heat transfer coefficient \( h \) in heat exchangers, which in turn affects the design and sizing of the exchanger.

#### **Flow Over Surfaces**
- In analyzing the heat transfer from a surface (like a flat plate, cylinder, or sphere) to a fluid, the Nusselt number helps predict the heat transfer rate.

#### **Internal Flow in Pipes and Ducts**
- For fluid flow inside pipes, ducts, or channels, the Nusselt number is used to evaluate the convective heat transfer from the fluid to the wall, which is critical for designing efficient cooling or heating systems.

### 4. **Correlations for Nusselt Number**

In practice, the Nusselt number is often determined using empirical or semi-empirical correlations that relate it to other dimensionless numbers such as the Reynolds number (\(Re\)) and the Prandtl number (\(Pr\)):

#### **Flow over a Flat Plate (Laminar Boundary Layer)**
For laminar flow over a flat plate with a uniform surface temperature, the Nusselt number can be approximated by:

$$
Nu_x = 0.332 Re_x^{1/2} Pr^{1/3},
$$

where \( Re_x = \frac{U x}{\nu} \) is the local Reynolds number based on the distance \( x \) from the leading edge of the plate.

The average Nusselt number over the length of the plate \( L \) is given by:

$$
Nu_L = 0.664 Re_L^{1/2} Pr^{1/3},
$$

where \( Re_L = \frac{UL}{\nu} \) is the Reynolds number based on the plate length.

#### **Fully Developed Flow in a Pipe (Laminar Flow)**
For fully developed laminar flow inside a circular pipe with constant wall temperature, the Nusselt number is constant:

$$
Nu = 3.66.
$$

For laminar flow with constant heat flux at the wall:

$$
Nu = 4.36.
$$

#### **Turbulent Flow**
For turbulent flow inside pipes, the Dittus-Boelter equation is often used:

$$
Nu = 0.023 Re^{0.8} Pr^{n},
$$

where \( n = 0.4 \) for heating (wall hotter than the fluid) and \( n = 0.3 \) for cooling (wall cooler than the fluid).

### 5. **Effect of Prandtl Number**

The Prandtl number (\(Pr\)) affects the thickness of the thermal boundary layer relative to the velocity boundary layer, and hence the Nusselt number. In general:

- **Low Prandtl Number (\(Pr \ll 1\))**: The thermal boundary layer is thicker than the velocity boundary layer, resulting in a lower Nusselt number.
- **High Prandtl Number (\(Pr \gg 1\))**: The thermal boundary layer is thinner than the velocity boundary layer, leading to a higher Nusselt number.

### 6. **Nusselt Number in Natural Convection**

In natural convection, where fluid motion is driven by buoyancy forces due to temperature differences rather than external forces, the Nusselt number is often correlated with the Rayleigh number (\(Ra\)), which combines the effects of the Grashof number (\(Gr\)) and the Prandtl number (\(Pr\)):

$$
Ra = Gr \cdot Pr,
$$

where the Grashof number \( Gr \) represents the ratio of buoyancy to viscous forces.

For natural convection over a vertical plate, an empirical correlation might look like:

$$
Nu_L = C Ra_L^n,
$$

where \( C \) and \( n \) are constants determined experimentally.

### 7. **Practical Examples**

- **Heating or Cooling a Flat Plate**: The Nusselt number can be used to determine the heat transfer coefficient for a flat plate exposed to a fluid, which is critical in applications such as solar panels or electronic cooling.
  
- **Designing Radiators**: The Nusselt number is essential in calculating the heat transfer efficiency of radiators, whether for automobiles or buildings.

- **Pipe Flow in Heat Exchangers**: In shell-and-tube heat exchangers, the Nusselt number helps determine the convective heat transfer coefficient for fluids flowing through the tubes.

### 8. **Conclusion**

The Nusselt number is a key dimensionless parameter in heat transfer analysis, providing a measure of the effectiveness of convective heat transfer relative to conduction. It is essential in the design, analysis, and optimization of systems where heat transfer is important, such as heat exchangers, cooling systems, and various industrial processes. By using correlations that relate the Nusselt number to other flow and thermal properties, engineers can predict and enhance the performance of thermal systems.
