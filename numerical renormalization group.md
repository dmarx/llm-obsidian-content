Numerical Renormalization Group


**ASSISTANT**

The Numerical Renormalization Group (NRG) is a powerful computational technique used to study quantum impurity problems, such as the Anderson impurity model and the Kondo model. It was developed by Kenneth Wilson in the 1970s to address the challenges of handling strong correlations and low-temperature behavior in these systems. NRG provides a systematic way to solve the many-body problem by iteratively reducing the degrees of freedom while preserving the essential physics.

## Overview

### Core Idea

The core idea of NRG is to discretize the continuous conduction band of the host metal into a finite set of states, which are then logarithmically spaced to capture the wide range of energy scales, particularly the low-energy excitations crucial for impurity physics. The Hamiltonian is then diagonalized iteratively, starting from the impurity and progressively including more of the conduction electron states.

### Discretization of the Conduction Band

The conduction band is discretized using a logarithmic mesh. The continuous energy spectrum of the conduction electrons is divided into intervals that get progressively smaller as they approach the Fermi energy. This logarithmic discretization allows for a detailed description of low-energy states, which are important for capturing the Kondo effect and other low-temperature phenomena.

#### Discretized Hamiltonian

The discretized Hamiltonian of the Anderson impurity model can be written as:

$$
H = H_{\text{imp}} + \sum_{n,\sigma} \epsilon_n c_{n\sigma}^\dagger c_{n\sigma} + \sum_{n,\sigma} V_n (c_{n\sigma}^\dagger d_\sigma + d_\sigma^\dagger c_{n\sigma}) + \sum_{n,\sigma} t_n (c_{n\sigma}^\dagger c_{n+1,\sigma} + c_{n+1,\sigma}^\dagger c_{n\sigma})
$$

where:
- \(H_{\text{imp}}\) is the impurity Hamiltonian,
- \(c_{n\sigma}^\dagger\) and \(c_{n\sigma}\) are the creation and annihilation operators for the discretized conduction states,
- \(V_n\) are the hybridization terms between the impurity and the conduction states,
- \(t_n\) are the hopping terms between the conduction states,
- \(\epsilon_n\) are the energies of the discretized conduction states.

### Iterative Diagonalization

The NRG process involves iteratively diagonalizing the Hamiltonian by progressively adding more of the discretized conduction electron states. This is done as follows:

1. **Initial Step**: Start with the Hamiltonian of the impurity coupled to the first conduction electron state.
2. **Iteration**: At each step, add one more conduction electron state and diagonalize the Hamiltonian of the system consisting of the impurity and the included conduction states.
3. **Truncation**: To keep the computational effort manageable, truncate the Hilbert space by retaining only the lowest-energy eigenstates at each iteration. This truncation is justified by the energy separation between the states due to the logarithmic discretization.

### Renormalization

The iterative diagonalization effectively renormalizes the Hamiltonian at each step, with the retained states forming a progressively lower-energy effective Hamiltonian. This renormalization process captures the flow of the system from high-energy to low-energy behavior, revealing the fixed points that characterize the impurity's physical properties.

### Thermodynamic and Dynamic Properties

Once the iterative process converges, the low-energy spectrum can be used to compute various thermodynamic and dynamic properties of the system, such as:
- **Spectral Functions**: The impurity spectral function \(A(\omega)\) provides information about the density of states at the impurity site.
- **Magnetic Susceptibility**: The temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility \(\chi(T)\) reveals information about the screening of the impurity spin.
- **Specific Heat**: The specific heat \(C(T)\) provides insights into the low-temperature excitations of the system.

## Applications

NRG has been successfully applied to a variety of quantum impurity problems and more complex systems:

1. **Anderson Impurity Model**: Studying the behavior of localized magnetic impurities in metals.
2. **Kondo Model**: Understanding the Kondo effect, where a localized spin is screened by conduction electrons.
3. **Quantum Dots**: Modeling the electronic properties of quantum dots coupled to leads.
4. **Heavy Fermion Systems**: Investigating the behavior of materials with strongly correlated f-electron systems.
5. **Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT)**: Solving the impurity problem within DMFT to study strongly correlated lattice systems.
