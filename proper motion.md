# Proper Motion

[[Proper motion]] represents the apparent angular motion of a star across the celestial sphere relative to the [[celestial reference frame]]. This motion reflects both the star's actual velocity through space and the motion of our solar system.

## Mathematical Formalization

Let $\vec{v}_{\perp}$ represent the tangential velocity component of a star perpendicular to our line of sight. The proper motion μ (typically measured in arcseconds per year) is given by:

```
μ = \frac{|\vec{v}_{\perp}|}{d}
```
where d is the distance to the star.

### Components

Proper motion is typically decomposed into two orthogonal components:
- μ_α: proper motion in [[right ascension]] (scaled by cos(δ))
- μ_δ: proper motion in [[declination]]

The total proper motion is:
```
μ = \sqrt{μ_α² + μ_δ²}
```

### [[Position Angle]] of Proper Motion

The direction of proper motion is specified by:
```
θ = arctan2(μ_α, μ_δ)
```

## [[Space Velocity]] Components

The complete motion of a star requires three components:
1. [[Proper Motion]] (tangential component)
2. [[Radial Velocity]] (line-of-sight component)
3. [[Parallax]] (for distance determination)

### [[Transverse Velocity]]

The physical velocity perpendicular to line of sight:
```
v_t = 4.74 \frac{μ}{\pi}
```
where:
- v_t is in km/s
- μ is in arcseconds/year
- π is the parallax in arcseconds

## Applications

### [[Statistical Parallax]]

Proper motions can be used to estimate distances through:
```
\langle μ² \rangle = \frac{\langle v_t² \rangle}{d²}
```
where angular brackets denote ensemble averages.

### [[Stellar Kinematics]]

The [[velocity ellipsoid]] of a stellar population can be derived from proper motion distributions using:
```
σ_i² = \sum_j (v_j - \bar{v}_j)²/N
```
where i denotes principal axes.

## Measurement Techniques

### [[Astrometric Solution]]

Modern measurements combine:
- [[Plate Solutions]]
- [[CCD Astrometry]]
- [[Space-based Astrometry]]

### [[Error Analysis]]

Key sources of uncertainty:
- [[Centroiding Errors]]
- [[Reference Frame Stability]]
- [[Atmospheric Effects]]
- [[Systematic Biases]]

## Historical Significance

### [[Moving Groups]]

Proper motions reveal:
- [[Stellar Associations]]
- [[Open Cluster]] remnants
- [[Stellar Streams]]

### [[Solar Motion]]

Analysis of proper motions led to discovery of:
- [[Solar Apex]]
- [[Local Standard of Rest]]
- [[Galactic Rotation]]

## Modern Applications

### [[Galactic Structure]]

Proper motions inform:
- [[Oort Constants]]
- [[Spiral Structure]]
- [[Dark Matter]] distribution

### [[Nearby Stars]]

High proper motion often indicates:
- [[Proximity]] to Solar System
- [[Low Luminosity]] objects
- [[Halo Population]] membership
