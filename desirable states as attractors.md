# Desirable States as Attractors

Desirable states in a [[dynamical system]] can be conceptualized as [[attractors]] under appropriate [[parameterization]]. This framing provides a powerful mathematical foundation for understanding how systems naturally evolve toward certain states and how we might design systems to have specific desirable properties.

## Mathematical Formalization

Consider a dynamical system described by:

$$\frac{d\mathbf{x}}{dt} = \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}, \boldsymbol{\theta})$$

Where:
- $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ represents the system state vector
- $\boldsymbol{\theta} \in \Theta$ represents a set of parameters
- $\mathbf{f}: \mathbb{R}^n \times \Theta \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ is a vector field

A set $A \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is an [[attractor]] if:
1. $A$ is [[invariant]] under the dynamics: if $\mathbf{x}_0 \in A$, then $\mathbf{x}(t) \in A$ for all $t > 0$
2. $A$ has a neighborhood $U$ (its [[basin of attraction]]) such that for all $\mathbf{x}_0 \in U$, $\lim_{t \to \infty} d(\mathbf{x}(t), A) = 0$
3. $A$ is minimal (no proper subset of $A$ satisfies properties 1 and 2)

## Parameterizing for Desirability

The core insight is that through appropriate parameter selection $\boldsymbol{\theta}^*$, we can reshape the [[vector field]] $\mathbf{f}$ such that desirable states become attractors of the system.

Let $D \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ be the set of desirable states. The goal is to find:

$$\boldsymbol{\theta}^* = \arg\min_{\boldsymbol{\theta} \in \Theta} d(A(\boldsymbol{\theta}), D)$$

Where:
- $A(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ represents the attractors of the system under parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta}$
- $d(\cdot,\cdot)$ is an appropriate distance measure

## Types of Desirable Attractors

### Fixed Point Attractors
For systems where stability at a specific state is desirable:

$$\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}^*, \boldsymbol{\theta}^*) = \mathbf{0}$$

With all eigenvalues of the [[Jacobian]] $\nabla_\mathbf{x}\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}^*, \boldsymbol{\theta}^*)$ having negative real parts.

### Limit Cycle Attractors
For systems where periodic behavior is desirable:

$$\mathbf{x}(t+T) = \mathbf{x}(t)$$

For some period $T > 0$, with the cycle being asymptotically stable.

### Strange Attractors
For systems where controlled chaotic behavior has benefits:

$$D_L > n$$

Where $D_L$ is the [[Lyapunov dimension]] of the attractor.

## Lyapunov Functions for Desirable States

A [[Lyapunov function]] $V: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ can be constructed such that:

$$\nabla V(\mathbf{x}) \cdot \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}, \boldsymbol{\theta}) < 0 \quad \forall \mathbf{x} \notin D$$

This ensures that the system evolves toward the desirable states $D$.

## Applications Across Domains

### Machine Learning

In [[gradient descent]]-based optimization:

$$\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t+1} = \boldsymbol{\theta}_t - \eta \nabla_{\boldsymbol{\theta}} L(\boldsymbol{\theta}_t)$$

The parameter space is structured so that minima of the [[loss function]] $L$ (desirable states) are attractors.

### Reinforcement Learning

The [[policy gradient]] method reshapes the [[policy space]] such that high-reward policies become attractors:

$$\nabla_{\boldsymbol{\theta}} J(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \mathbb{E}_{\pi_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}}\left[\nabla_{\boldsymbol{\theta}} \log \pi_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(a|s) \cdot Q^{\pi_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}}(s,a)\right]$$

### Artificial Neural Networks

[[Hopfield networks]] can be designed where desired memories become attractors:

$$E(\mathbf{x}) = -\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i,j} w_{ij} x_i x_j - \sum_i b_i x_i$$

### Self-Organizing Systems

In [[self-organization]], parameter tuning leads to emergence of desired collective behaviors:

$$\mathbf{x}_i(t+1) = \mathbf{x}_i(t) + \sum_{j \in N_i} \mathbf{g}(\mathbf{x}_i(t), \mathbf{x}_j(t), \boldsymbol{\theta})$$

## Energy Landscapes and Potential Fields

Desirable states can be characterized as minima in an [[energy landscape]]:

$$E(\mathbf{x}, \boldsymbol{\theta}) = \sum_{i=1}^k V_i(\mathbf{x}, \boldsymbol{\theta})$$

Where each $V_i$ represents a potential well centered on a desirable state.

## Control-Theoretic Perspectives

From [[control theory]], we can view the parameterization process as designing a controller:

$$\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{K}(\boldsymbol{\theta}) \cdot (\mathbf{x}_d - \mathbf{x})$$

Where $\mathbf{x}_d$ represents the desired state and $\mathbf{K}(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ is a gain matrix.

## Philosophical Implications

The framing of desirable states as attractors connects to philosophical concepts including:

- [[Teleology]] and [[goal-directedness]]
- [[Free energy principle]] in cognitive science
- [[Homeostasis]] in biological systems
- [[Value alignment]] in AI safety

## Challenges and Limitations

1. **Multimodality**: Systems may have multiple attractors, not all desirable
2. **Robustness**: Ensuring attractors remain stable under perturbations
3. **Computability**: Finding optimal parameterizations may be intractable
4. **Metastability**: Systems may spend extended periods near undesirable states
5. **Unknowable Desirability**: In some contexts, it may be unclear which states should be considered desirable

## Research Directions

- Topological methods for characterizing basins of attraction
- Geometric deep learning for parameterizing complex systems
- Information-theoretic measures of attractor robustness
- Meta-learning approaches to discover appropriate parameterizations
- Ethical frameworks for defining desirable states in socio-technical systems
