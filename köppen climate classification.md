Köppen climate classification


**ASSISTANT**

The [[Köppen Climate Classification]] is one of the most widely used systems for classifying the world's climates. Developed by Wladimir Köppen in the early 20th century, it categorizes climates based on average monthly and annual temperatures and precipitation. The system is particularly useful for its simplicity and its ability to relate climate to vegetation types.

### Classification System

The Köppen climate classification system is divided into five primary groups, each designated by a capital letter:

1. **A - Tropical**
2. **B - Dry**
3. **C - Temperate**
4. **D - Continental**
5. **E - Polar**

Each primary group is further subdivided based on specific temperature and precipitation criteria.

#### A - Tropical Climates
- **Af (Tropical Rainforest):** No dry season. All months have average precipitation of at least 60 mm.
- **Am (Tropical Monsoon):** Short dry season with a peak rainy season.
- **Aw/As (Tropical Savanna):** Distinct wet and dry seasons. Aw if dry season in winter, As if dry season in summer.

#### B - Dry Climates
- **BWh (Desert, Hot):** Very low precipitation, high temperatures.
- **BWk (Desert, Cold):** Low precipitation, lower temperatures.
- **BSh (Steppe, Hot):** Semi-arid, with slightly more precipitation than deserts.
- **BSk (Steppe, Cold):** Semi-arid, with cooler temperatures than hot steppes.

#### C - Temperate Climates
- **Cfa (Humid Subtropical):** No dry season, hot summers.
- **Cfb (Marine West Coast):** No dry season, warm to cool summers.
- **Cfc (Subpolar Oceanic):** No dry season, cold summers.
- **Csa (Mediterranean, Hot Summer):** Dry, hot summers.
- **Csb (Mediterranean, Warm Summer):** Dry, warm summers.

#### D - Continental Climates
- **Dfa (Humid Continental, Hot Summer):** No dry season, hot summers.
- **Dfb (Humid Continental, Warm Summer):** No dry season, warm summers.
- **Dfc (Subarctic):** No dry season, cold winters, short cool summers.
- **Dfd (Subarctic, Severe Winter):** No dry season, extremely cold winters.

#### E - Polar Climates
- **ET (Tundra):** No true summer, average temperature of the warmest month below 10°C.
- **EF (Ice Cap):** Perpetual ice and snow, average temperature of the warmest month below 0°C.

### Criteria and Mathematical Formalization

The criteria for distinguishing between these classifications often involve thresholds for temperature and precipitation. Here are some of the key formulas and thresholds used:

#### Temperature Criteria
1. **Monthly Mean Temperature ($T_{mean}$):** The average temperature of a given month.
2. **Annual Mean Temperature ($T_{annual}$):** The average temperature across all months of a year.
3. **Monthly Temperature Extremes ($T_{max}, T_{min}$):** The highest and lowest average temperatures recorded for a month.

#### Precipitation Criteria
1. **Monthly Precipitation ($P_{monthly}$):** The total precipitation received in a given month.
2. **Annual Precipitation ($P_{annual}$):** The total precipitation received in a year.

##### Example Criterion for Dry Climates:
For a climate to be classified as dry (B), the following condition must be satisfied:
$$
P_{annual} < 10 \times (T_{annual} + c)
$$
where \( c \) is a constant that varies depending on the distribution of precipitation:
- \( c = 0 \) if 70% or more of the precipitation falls in the high-sun half of the year (April to September in the Northern Hemisphere, October to March in the Southern Hemisphere).
- \( c = 20 \) if 70% or more of the precipitation falls in the low-sun half of the year.
- \( c = 10 \) otherwise.

#### Tropical Climates:
For tropical climates (A):
- Mean temperature of the coldest month is above 18°C.
- Precipitation criteria vary for Af, Am, and Aw/As as defined above.

### Applications and Importance

The Köppen climate classification system is extensively used in [[climatology]], [[biogeography]], [[agriculture]], and environmental research. It helps in understanding climate zones and their corresponding vegetation, predicting agricultural productivity, and studying ecological dynamics.

By employing the Köppen climate classification, researchers and policymakers can better grasp regional climate characteristics and plan accordingly for agriculture, urban development, and disaster preparedness.
