# Granularity-Related Inconsistency of Means

## Overview

[[Granularity-related inconsistency of means]] refers to a phenomenon where statistical measures of central tendency, particularly the [[arithmetic mean]], produce inconsistent or counterintuitive results when applied to data aggregated at different levels of granularity. This inconsistency emerges from the mathematical properties of means when applied to grouped versus ungrouped data and has significant implications for [[data analysis]], [[statistical inference]], and [[decision-making]] across various domains.

## Mathematical Formalization

Let us consider a dataset $X = \{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\}$ with corresponding weights $W = \{w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n\}$ where $w_i > 0$ for all $i$.

The weighted arithmetic mean is defined as:

$$\mu_X = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i}$$

Now, suppose we partition this dataset into $m$ groups $G_1, G_2, \ldots, G_m$ where each group $G_j$ contains elements $\{x_{j,1}, x_{j,2}, \ldots, x_{j,n_j}\}$ with corresponding weights $\{w_{j,1}, w_{j,2}, \ldots, w_{j,n_j}\}$.

For each group $G_j$, we can calculate the group mean:

$$\mu_{G_j} = \frac{\sum_{k=1}^{n_j} w_{j,k} x_{j,k}}{\sum_{k=1}^{n_j} w_{j,k}}$$

If we then calculate a weighted mean of these group means, with the weights being the sum of weights in each group:

$$\mu_G = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^{m} (\sum_{k=1}^{n_j} w_{j,k}) \mu_{G_j}}{\sum_{j=1}^{m} \sum_{k=1}^{n_j} w_{j,k}}$$

The inconsistency arises because, in general, $\mu_X \neq \mu_G$. This inequality indicates that the mean calculated from individual data points may differ from the mean calculated using group-level means, even when the underlying data is identical.

## Examples of Inconsistency

### Simpson's Paradox

The most famous manifestation of granularity-related inconsistency is [[Simpson's paradox]], where a trend that appears in groups of data disappears or reverses when the groups are combined. This can be mathematically represented by a scenario where:

$$\mu_{G_1,A} > \mu_{G_1,B}, \mu_{G_2,A} > \mu_{G_2,B}, \ldots, \mu_{G_m,A} > \mu_{G_m,B}$$

But when the data is aggregated:

$$\mu_A < \mu_B$$

Where $A$ and $B$ represent two different conditions or treatments being compared.

### Ecological Fallacy

The [[ecological fallacy]] occurs when inferences about individuals are drawn based on aggregate statistics for a group. This fallacy directly relates to granularity inconsistency, as aggregate measures may not represent the characteristics of individuals within the group.

## Formal Properties

The inconsistency of means across granularity levels exhibits several formal properties:

1. **Monotonicity Violation**: The relationship between variables at one level of aggregation may not maintain the same direction at another level.

2. **Non-linearity**: The relationship between the original mean ($\mu_X$) and the group-level mean ($\mu_G$) is generally non-linear and depends on the distribution of weights across groups.

3. **Decomposability**: The total variance can be decomposed into within-group and between-group components:
   
   $$\sigma^2_{\text{total}} = \sigma^2_{\text{within}} + \sigma^2_{\text{between}}$$
   
   Where:
   - $\sigma^2_{\text{within}} = \sum_{j=1}^{m} \frac{w_j}{\sum_{k=1}^{m} w_k} \sigma^2_j$ (weighted average of group variances)
   - $\sigma^2_{\text{between}} = \sum_{j=1}^{m} \frac{w_j}{\sum_{k=1}^{m} w_k} (\mu_j - \mu_{\text{total}})^2$ (variance of group means)

## Symbolic Notation for Modeling Granularity Effects

To systematically analyze granularity-related inconsistencies, we can define a granularity operator $\mathcal{G}$ that maps from one level of data aggregation to another:

$$\mathcal{G}: \mathcal{D} \rightarrow \mathcal{D}'$$

Where $\mathcal{D}$ represents the original data space and $\mathcal{D}'$ represents the aggregated data space.

The inconsistency measure $\mathcal{I}$ between two granularity levels can then be defined as:

$$\mathcal{I}(\mathcal{G}, \mu) = |\mu(\mathcal{D}) - \mu(\mathcal{G}(\mathcal{D}))|$$

Where $\mu(\mathcal{D})$ is the mean calculated on the original data and $\mu(\mathcal{G}(\mathcal{D}))$ is the mean calculated on the aggregated data.

## Implications and Applications

### Statistical Methodology

Granularity-related inconsistencies necessitate careful consideration in:

- [[Multi-level modeling]]: Accounting for hierarchical data structures
- [[Causal inference]]: Identifying true relationships versus spurious correlations
- [[Meta-analysis]]: Combining results from multiple studies with different granularity levels

### Machine Learning

In machine learning contexts, these inconsistencies relate to:

- [[Feature aggregation]]: How features are summarized affects model performance
- [[Transfer learning]]: Knowledge gained at one level of abstraction may not transfer to another
- [[Hierarchical clustering]]: The choice of aggregation methods influences clustering results

### Decision Theory

For decision-making purposes, granularity inconsistencies impact:

- [[Group decision-making]]: Aggregating individual preferences may lead to inconsistent group preferences
- [[Resource allocation]]: Decisions based on aggregated statistics may misallocate resources
- [[Policy evaluation]]: Effects observed at population levels may diverge from individual-level outcomes

## Mitigation Strategies

Several approaches can help address granularity-related inconsistencies:

1. **Stratification**: Analyzing data within homogeneous subgroups
2. **Hierarchical modeling**: Explicitly modeling relationships at multiple levels
3. **Sensitivity analysis**: Examining how results change under different aggregation schemes
4. **Standardization**: Using standardized measures less susceptible to aggregation effects
5. **Causal modeling**: Employing formal causal inference techniques to identify true relationships

## Related Concepts

- [[Aggregation bias]]: Systematic errors introduced through data aggregation
- [[Ecological correlation]]: Correlations that exist at group levels but not at individual levels
- [[Information loss]]: Reduction in information content through aggregation processes
- [[Scale invariance]]: Properties that remain constant across different levels of aggregation

## Mathematical Generalizations

The inconsistency problem generalizes beyond the arithmetic mean to other statistical measures:

- For [[geometric mean]] $G(X) = \left(\prod_{i=1}^{n} x_i^{w_i}\right)^{1/\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i}$, similar inconsistencies arise
- For [[harmonic mean]] $H(X) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{w_i}{x_i}}$, the aggregation effects can be even more pronounced
- For [[median]] and other [[quantiles]], the relationship between individual and aggregated measures becomes more complex

The general principle can be formalized using [[Jensen's inequality]] for convex functions, which provides a mathematical foundation for understanding when and why these inconsistencies occur.
