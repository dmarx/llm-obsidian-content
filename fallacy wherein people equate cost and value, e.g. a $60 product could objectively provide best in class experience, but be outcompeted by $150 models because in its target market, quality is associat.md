the fallacy wherein people equate cost and value, e.g. a $60 product could objectively provide best in class experience, but be outcompeted by $150 models because in its target market, quality is associated with $300 options


**ASSISTANT**

The fallacy you’re describing is a specific manifestation of the **price-value heuristic** or **price-quality fallacy**. It occurs when people mistakenly equate a product's **price** with its **value** or **quality**—leading them to infer that higher-priced products are necessarily better, even in cases where this assumption is unwarranted. 

This fallacy can emerge due to several psychological and social factors:

---

### 1. **Price as a Proxy for Quality**
   When direct evaluation of quality is difficult, individuals often use price as a cognitive shortcut (heuristic) to infer quality. For instance:
   $$\text{If } p \text{ (price)} \uparrow \Rightarrow q \text{ (quality)} \uparrow.$$
   This assumption can hold in markets where prices are genuinely reflective of quality but becomes a fallacy when marketers exploit it. For example:
   - A **$60 product** might offer the same or better quality than a **$150 product** in a target market where **$300 options** are perceived as premium.
   - Buyers may dismiss the $60 product as "too cheap to be good," even if it outperforms competitors.

---

### 2. **Market Signaling**
   [[Market signaling]] refers to the idea that prices are not just a direct reflection of costs but also a form of communication. A higher price can signal:
   - **Exclusivity** (e.g., luxury branding).
   - **Reputation** (e.g., "You get what you pay for").
   - **Production quality** (though often falsely).

   When consumers believe a $150 product "must be better" because it’s closer to the $300 benchmark, they are responding to the signal, not the substance.

---

### 3. **Reference Points and Anchoring**
   Consumers are influenced by reference prices, often set by the most expensive options in the market. For example:
   - A $300 "premium" product might anchor expectations, such that a $150 product feels "acceptable" while a $60 product feels "suspiciously cheap."
   - This **anchoring effect** distorts rational assessments of objective quality.

   Mathematically, this can be formalized by reference-dependent utility in [[Prospect Theory]]:
   $$ U(x | r) = v(x) - v(r), $$
   where $r$ is the reference price, and $v$ is the perceived value. If $r$ is high (e.g., $300), consumers undervalue products far below $r$.

### 4. **Social Status and Prestige Consumption**
   In markets where **social signaling** matters, buyers may value the status conferred by an expensive product more than its intrinsic utility. Even if a $60 product is objectively superior in functionality, it may fail to compete because it doesn't align with the consumer's social goals.

---

### Avoiding the Fallacy
   - **Consumer Education**: Highlight objective metrics like durability, performance, or functionality to help customers look beyond price.
   - **Transparent Marketing**: Brands can differentiate products based on independent benchmarks rather than price.
   - **Decoy Pricing**: Introduce intermediate-priced products to bridge perceived gaps between low-cost and premium models.

Would you like a deeper dive into the mathematics of reference-dependent preferences or signaling models? This can tie neatly into formal economic models like [[Akerlof's Market for Lemons]].
