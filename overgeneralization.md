### Overgeneralization

[[Overgeneralization]] is a cognitive distortion in which a single event or experience is generalized to a broad context, leading to the belief that the occurrence represents a universal pattern. This type of thinking is often characterized by making sweeping conclusions based on limited evidence and can contribute to various emotional and behavioral issues.

### Characteristics of Overgeneralization

1. **Single Incident to Broad Conclusion**:
    - Drawing broad, generalized conclusions from a single incident or a small number of experiences.
    - Example: Failing one exam and concluding, "I am always a failure."

2. **Use of Absolutes**:
    - Statements often involve words like "always," "never," "every," and "nobody," indicating a lack of exceptions.
    - Example: "I never do anything right."

3. **Negative Bias**:
    - Overgeneralizations are frequently negative, leading to pessimistic views about oneself, others, or the world.
    - Example: "Nobody likes me."

### Cognitive Mechanisms Behind Overgeneralization

1. **Heuristics**:
    - Overgeneralization is a type of heuristic, a mental shortcut that simplifies decision-making but can lead to systematic errors.
    - Example: Assuming that one failure in a social situation means all social interactions will fail.

2. **Schemas**:
    - Pre-existing [[schemas]] can contribute to overgeneralization by filtering new information through established beliefs, leading to biased interpretations.
    - Example: Someone with a schema of being incompetent may overgeneralize a single mistake as evidence of overall incompetence.

3. **Confirmation Bias**:
    - Tendency to seek out or interpret information in a way that confirms existing beliefs, reinforcing overgeneralized thinking.
    - Example: Remembering failures more vividly than successes.

### Emotional and Behavioral Impact

1. **Anxiety and Depression**:
    - Overgeneralization can lead to heightened anxiety and depression by fostering a negative view of oneself and one's capabilities.
    - Example: Believing that a single rejection means one is unlovable, leading to feelings of hopelessness.

2. **Low Self-Esteem**:
    - Generalizing negative experiences to one's entire self-concept can damage self-esteem.
    - Example: "I made a mistake at work, so I am not good at my job."

3. **Avoidance Behavior**:
    - Fear of repeated negative experiences may lead to avoidance of situations perceived as threatening.
    - Example: Avoiding social gatherings after one awkward interaction.

4. **Interpersonal Problems**:
    - Overgeneralized negative beliefs about others can strain relationships and hinder social interactions.
    - Example: "People always disappoint me, so I can't trust anyone."

### Identifying Overgeneralization

1. **Thought Records**:
    - Keeping a thought record helps identify instances of overgeneralization by documenting specific thoughts, situations, and emotional responses.
    - Example Thought Record:
        | Situation               | Automatic Thought           | Emotion        | Intensity (0-100) |
        |-------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------|------------------|
        | Failed a test           | "I never succeed in anything" | Sadness        | 80               |
        | Argument with a friend  | "Nobody likes me"             | Loneliness     | 70               |

2. **Self-Monitoring**:
    - Regularly monitoring oneâ€™s thoughts and identifying patterns of overgeneralization.
    - Example: Noticing the frequent use of absolutes in self-talk.

3. **Cognitive Distortion Checklists**:
    - Using checklists of common cognitive distortions to identify and label instances of overgeneralization.
    - Example: Reviewing a list of cognitive distortions and noting overgeneralization in daily thoughts
