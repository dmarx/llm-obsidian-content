**USER**

right of paternity


**ASSISTANT**

The **right of paternity** is a key component of moral rights under copyright law. It grants authors the right to be acknowledged as the creators of their works. This right is recognized internationally under the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] and in various national laws. Here's an in-depth exploration of the right of paternity, its legal basis, implications, and examples.

## Key Aspects of the Right of Paternity

### Definition

The right of paternity allows authors to claim authorship of their works and to be credited for their creation. It also provides the right to object to false attribution, where someone else is wrongly credited as the author of the work.

### Legal Basis

#### Berne Convention

- **Article 6bis**: The Berne Convention specifically addresses the right of paternity in Article 6bis. It grants authors the right to be recognized as the author of their works and to object to any distortion, mutilation, or other modification that would be prejudicial to their honor or reputation.
- **Duration**: The protection of moral rights, including the right of paternity, is typically as long as the copyright in the work, although the specifics can vary by jurisdiction.

#### National Laws

- **France**: French law provides robust protection for moral rights, reflecting a strong emphasis on the personal connection between authors and their works.
- **United States**: The Visual Artists Rights Act (VARA) of 1990 grants limited moral rights, including the right of paternity, to creators of visual art.
- **United Kingdom**: UK law, under the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, recognizes the right of paternity, allowing authors to assert their authorship and prevent false attribution.

### Implications

#### Attribution

- **Proper Credit**: Authors can ensure they are properly credited whenever their work is used or distributed. This is crucial for maintaining their reputation and career.
- **False Attribution**: Authors can object to and seek remedies for instances where someone else is falsely credited as the author of their work.

#### Acknowledgment in Various Media

- **Books and Articles**: Authors have the right to be acknowledged in all copies of their books, articles, and other written works.
- **Art and Photography**: Artists and photographers have the right to be credited for their works whenever they are displayed, published, or reproduced.
- **Film and Music**: Directors, screenwriters, composers, and musicians have the right to be recognized in credits and other acknowledgments of their contributions.

### Examples

#### Literature

- **Authorship Recognition**: A novelist can ensure their name appears on all published copies of their book and can object if a publisher fails to credit them properly.

#### Visual Arts

- **Artist Attribution**: A painter can insist that their name be displayed alongside their paintings in galleries and exhibitions, and can object if someone else is credited with their work.

#### Music

- **Composer Credits**: A composer can require that their name appears in program notes and recordings of their compositions, and can object to any omission or misattribution.

### Case Studies

#### Gilliam v. American Broadcasting Companies, Inc.

- **Background**: This 1976 case involved members of Monty Python suing ABC for broadcasting heavily edited versions of their TV shows without proper attribution.
- **Outcome**: The court recognized the importance of proper attribution and the right of the authors to be credited for their original work, thus upholding their right of paternity.

#### VARA Cases

- **Visual Artists Rights Act**: Under VARA, artists have successfully asserted their right of paternity. For instance, in *Moral Rights and VARA: Protecting the Artist* (1991), artists were able to secure recognition for their works in public spaces and prevent false attribution.
