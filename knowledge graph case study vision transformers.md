**USER**

consider a SOTA research article, and a formerly SOTA work which the newer work supercedes. Use concrete, real articles for these motivating examples. Demonstrate how these two articles factorize and interrelate using your proposed system. Afterwards, critique the strengths and weaknesses of your approach in the context of this motivating example.

# Knowledge Graph Case Study: Vision Transformers

## Original Work
```
Paper: "An Image is Worth 16x16 Words" (ViT, 2020)

Claims: {
  c1: "Pure transformer viable for vision",
  c2: "Patch-based tokenization effective",
  c3: "Pre-training at scale crucial"
}

Evidence: {
  e1: {
    claim: c1,
    benchmark: "ImageNet",
    metric: "Top-1 Accuracy",
    value: 88.55,
    validation: {
      dataset_size: "JFT-300M",
      compute: "TPUv3-512",
      reproduction_count: 12
    }
  }
}
```

## Superseding Work
```
Paper: "MaxViT: Multi-Axis Vision Transformer" (2022)

Claims: {
  c4: "Block-based attention more efficient",
  c5: "Multi-axis attention improves accuracy",
  deprecates: {
    target: c1,
    aspect: "efficiency",
    evidence: {
      benchmark: "ImageNet",
      metric: "FLOPs",
      delta: "-47%"
    }
  }
}

BenchmarkValidation: {
  name: "ImageNet",
  known_issues: ["Resolution dependence"],
  affected_claims: [c1, c4, c5],
  reliability_adjustment: 0.9
}
```

## Critique

Strengths:
- Tracks partial deprecation
- Propagates benchmark reliability
- Maintains measurement context

Weaknesses:
- Implicit relationships between benchmarks/metrics
- Limited granularity in deprecation relationships
- Missing standardization of compute metrics
