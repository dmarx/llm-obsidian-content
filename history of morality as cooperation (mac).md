### History of Morality as Cooperation (MAC)

The theory of Morality as Cooperation (MAC) is an integrative approach that examines morality through the lens of cooperative behavior. It builds upon various scientific disciplines including evolutionary biology, psychology, anthropology, and philosophy. Here, we'll trace the historical development and major contributions to this theory.

#### Early Foundations in Evolutionary Theory

1. **Charles Darwin**: In "The Descent of Man" (1871), Darwin proposed that moral behavior evolved through natural selection, suggesting that groups with cooperative individuals would have survival advantages over less cooperative groups.

2. **W.D. Hamilton (1960s)**: Hamilton's theory of kin selection provided a mathematical framework explaining how cooperation can evolve among related individuals. Hamilton's rule ($rB > C$) formalized the idea that genes promoting altruistic behavior towards relatives could spread through populations.

3. **Robert Trivers (1970s)**: Trivers' concept of reciprocal altruism extended the idea of cooperation beyond kin. He argued that individuals could evolve to cooperate with non-relatives if there were mechanisms to ensure reciprocity over time.

#### Development of Game Theory and Evolutionary Game Theory

1. **John Maynard Smith (1980s)**: Smith's application of game theory to biology, especially through the concept of Evolutionarily Stable Strategies (ESS), provided insights into how cooperative strategies could be stable over evolutionary time.

2. **Public Goods Games and Common Pool Resources**: Research on public goods games and the management of common pool resources by economists like Elinor Ostrom illustrated how communities could develop cooperative strategies to manage shared resources effectively.

#### Psychological and Anthropological Contributions

1. **Moral Foundations Theory (Jonathan Haidt, 2000s)**: Haidt's theory identified several innate psychological foundations for morality, such as care, fairness, loyalty, authority, and sanctity. These foundations can be seen as promoting various forms of cooperation within societies.

2. **Christopher Boehm (1999)**: In "Hierarchy in the Forest," Boehm argued that moral norms and behaviors in human societies evolved to promote egalitarianism and cooperation, particularly in hunter-gatherer societies.

#### Synthesis and Formalization of MAC

1. **Richard D. Alexander (1987)**: In "The Biology of Moral Systems," Alexander synthesized evolutionary and sociobiological perspectives to argue that human moral systems evolved to regulate selfishness and promote cooperative behavior within groups.

2. **Peter J. Richerson and Robert Boyd (2005)**: In "Not by Genes Alone," Richerson and Boyd highlighted the role of cultural evolution in shaping human cooperation and morality, emphasizing the interplay between genetic and cultural factors.

3. **Nicholas Baumard, Jean-Baptiste Andr√©, and Dan Sperber (2013)**: In their paper "A Mutualistic Approach to Morality," these authors proposed that morality evolved as a form of mutualistic cooperation, where moral norms promote mutually beneficial interactions.

4. **Oliver Scott Curry (2016)**: Curry's work explicitly framed morality as a collection of cooperative strategies. In his review "Morality as Cooperation," he argued that moral values can be understood as solutions to problems of cooperation recurrent in human social life, such as helping kin, forming alliances, and resolving conflicts.

#### Modern Integrative Approaches

1. **The Evolution of Morality**: Contemporary researchers continue to integrate findings from genetics, neuroscience, anthropology, and psychology to understand how moral behaviors and norms evolve. The interplay between biological predispositions and cultural innovations remains a key focus.

2. **Cross-Cultural Studies**: Ongoing research examines the universality and variability of moral norms across cultures, providing empirical support for the idea that while the foundations of morality are universal, their specific expressions can vary widely depending on ecological and social contexts.

### Conclusion

The history of the theory of Morality as Cooperation is a rich tapestry of interdisciplinary research. From Darwin's early insights to modern integrative approaches, the theory has evolved to encompass a wide range of empirical findings and theoretical models. It continues to provide a powerful framework for understanding the origins and functions of human morality.
