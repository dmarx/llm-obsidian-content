## Formal Definition of an "Environment" in Reinforcement Learning

### Overview

In the context of [[reinforcement learning]] (RL), the **environment** is the external system with which an agent interacts. The environment receives actions from the agent and responds by transitioning between states and providing rewards. It serves as the context within which the agent learns to make decisions and achieve its objectives.

### Formal Definition

An environment in RL can be formally defined by the following components:

1. **State Space (\(S\))**
2. **Action Space (\(A\))**
3. **Transition Function (\(P\))**
4. **Reward Function (\(R\))**
5. **Initial State Distribution (\(P_0\))**

### Components

#### 1. State Space (\(S\))

The state space \(S\) is a set of all possible states \(s \in S\) that describe the environment at any given time. Each state encapsulates all relevant information needed by the agent to make decisions.

- **Example**: In a grid-world environment, a state \(s\) might represent the agent's position on the grid.

#### 2. Action Space (\(A\))

The action space \(A\) is a set of all possible actions \(a \in A\) that the agent can take. The environment defines how each action affects the state.

- **Example**: In a grid-world environment, the action space might include \{up, down, left, right\}.

#### 3. Transition Function (\(P\))

The transition function \(P\) defines the probability of transitioning from one state to another given an action. It is often represented as \(P(s' | s, a)\), which is the probability of transitioning to state \(s'\) given the current state \(s\) and action \(a\).

\[
P: S \times A \times S \to [0, 1]
\]

- **Example**: In a grid-world environment, if the agent moves right from position \((x, y)\), the transition might deterministically move the agent to \((x+1, y)\).

#### 4. Reward Function (\(R\))

The reward function \(R\) provides the immediate reward received after transitioning from state \(s\) to state \(s'\) due to action \(a\). It is often denoted as \(R(s, a, s')\).

\[
R: S \times A \times S \to \mathbb{R}
\]

- **Example**: In a grid-world environment, reaching the goal state might provide a reward of \(+1\), while other transitions provide a reward of \(0\).

#### 5. Initial State Distribution (\(P_0\))

The initial state distribution \(P_0\) defines the probability distribution over the initial states where the agent starts.

\[
P_0: S \to [0, 1]
\]

- **Example**: In a grid-world environment, the agent might always start at the bottom-left corner \((1, 1)\), so \(P_0((1, 1)) = 1\).

### Formal Representation of an Environment

An environment can be represented formally as a tuple \((S, A, P, R, P_0)\), where:

- \(S\) is the state space.
- \(A\) is the action space.
- \(P\) is the transition function.
- \(R\) is the reward function.
- \(P_0\) is the initial state distribution.

### Example: Formal Representation in Grid-World

Consider a 5x5 grid-world environment with the goal of reaching the top-right corner from the bottom-left corner.

- **State Space (\(S\))**: The set of all possible positions on the grid, \(S = \{(x, y) | x, y \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\}\).
- **Action Space (\(A\))**: The set of possible movements, \(A = \{\text{up}, \text{down}, \text{left}, \text{right}\}\).
- **Transition Function (\(P\))**:
  \[
  P((x', y') | (x, y), a) = 
  \begin{cases}
    1 & \text{if } (x', y') = (x+1, y) \text{ and } a = \text{right}\\
    1 & \text{if } (x', y') = (x-1, y) \text{ and } a = \text{left}\\
    1 & \text{if } (x', y') = (x, y+1) \text{ and } a = \text{up}\\
    1 & \text{if } (x', y') = (x, y-1) \text{ and } a = \text{down}\\
    0 & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
  \]
- **Reward Function (\(R\))**:
  \[
  R((x, y), a, (x', y')) = 
  \begin{cases}
    1 & \text{if } (x', y') = (5, 5) \\
    0 & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
  \]
- **Initial State Distribution (\(P_0\))**:
  \[
  P_0((1, 1)) = 1, \quad P_0((x, y)) = 0 \quad \text{for all other } (x, y) \in S
  \]

### Conclusion

An environment in [[reinforcement learning]] is a formally defined system that interacts with an agent, providing states, rewards, and transitions based on the agent's actions. The environment can be succinctly represented by a tuple \((S, A, P, R, P_0)\), which includes the state space, action space, transition function, reward function, and initial state distribution. This formal representation helps in designing and analyzing RL problems, ensuring clarity and rigor in the development and evaluation of RL algorithms.
