number field


**ASSISTANT**

A **number field** is a finite extension of the field of rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$. In other words, it is a field that contains $\mathbb{Q}$ and has finite dimension when considered as a vector space over $\mathbb{Q}$. Number fields play a central role in algebraic number theory and are the setting for many important problems in arithmetic, including the study of algebraic integers, Diophantine equations, and class field theory.

### 1. **Formal Definition**:
A **number field** $F$ is a field extension of $\mathbb{Q}$ such that the degree $[F : \mathbb{Q}]$ (the dimension of $F$ as a vector space over $\mathbb{Q}$) is finite. That is:
$$
F = \mathbb{Q}(\alpha) \quad \text{for some algebraic element} \, \alpha \in F,
$$
where $\alpha$ is a root of a polynomial with rational coefficients. Such an $\alpha$ satisfies a **minimal polynomial** $p(x) \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$.

### 2. **Examples**:
Some basic examples of number fields include:

- **Rational numbers**: The simplest example of a number field is $\mathbb{Q}$ itself. Since $[\mathbb{Q} : \mathbb{Q}] = 1$, $\mathbb{Q}$ is trivially a number field.
  
- **Quadratic fields**: Fields of the form $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})$, where $d$ is a square-free integer, are quadratic number fields. These are the simplest examples of number fields that are proper extensions of $\mathbb{Q}$.
  - Example: $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-1}) = \{a + b \sqrt{-1} \mid a, b \in \mathbb{Q}\}$, which is the field of complex numbers with rational coefficients.

- **Cyclotomic fields**: Fields of the form $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_n)$, where $\zeta_n$ is a primitive $n$th root of unity. These are examples of **Galois extensions** of $\mathbb{Q}$.
  - Example: $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_3) = \mathbb{Q}(e^{2 \pi i / 3})$ is a cubic field, meaning its degree over $\mathbb{Q}$ is $3$.

### 3. **Degree of a Number Field**:
The **degree** of a number field $F$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ is the dimension of $F$ as a vector space over $\mathbb{Q}$:
$$
[F : \mathbb{Q}] = n
$$
This means that there exist $n$ linearly independent elements of $F$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, and any element of $F$ can be written as a $\mathbb{Q}$-linear combination of these elements. For example, the quadratic field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})$ has degree 2 over $\mathbb{Q}$.

### 4. **Algebraic Numbers and Minimal Polynomials**:
Every element of a number field $F$ is an **algebraic number**â€”that is, a root of a polynomial with coefficients in $\mathbb{Q}$. For instance, if $F = \mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$, then $\alpha$ satisfies an irreducible polynomial $p(x) \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$ called the **minimal polynomial** of $\alpha$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. The degree of this polynomial is the degree of the extension $F$ over $\mathbb{Q}$.

### 5. **Ring of Integers**:
A key concept associated with a number field $F$ is its **ring of integers**, denoted $\mathcal{O}_F$. This is the set of elements in $F$ that are **algebraic integers**. An element $\alpha \in F$ is called an algebraic integer if it is a root of a monic polynomial (i.e., a polynomial with leading coefficient 1) with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}$:
$$
\alpha^n + a_{n-1}\alpha^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 \alpha + a_0 = 0 \quad \text{where} \, a_i \in \mathbb{Z}.
$$
The ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_F$ generalizes the integers $\mathbb{Z}$ in $\mathbb{Q}$ and forms a **Dedekind domain**, which means that every nonzero ideal in $\mathcal{O}_F$ can be factored uniquely into prime ideals.

For example:
- In $\mathbb{Q}$, the ring of integers is just $\mathbb{Z}$.
- In the quadratic field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-5})$, the ring of integers is $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}] = \{a + b\sqrt{-5} \mid a, b \in \mathbb{Z}\}$.

### 6. **Prime Decomposition**:
In a number field, the familiar notion of prime factorization of integers generalizes to **prime ideals** in the ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_F$. A prime number $p \in \mathbb{Z}$ may **split**, **remain inert**, or **ramify** in a number field $F$, leading to different types of prime ideals in $\mathcal{O}_F$. This gives rise to the following behavior:
- **Splitting**: A prime $p \in \mathbb{Z}$ may split into several prime ideals in $\mathcal{O}_F$. For instance, $p\mathcal{O}_F = \mathfrak{p}_1 \mathfrak{p}_2$ where $\mathfrak{p}_1$ and $\mathfrak{p}_2$ are distinct prime ideals in $\mathcal{O}_F$.
- **Inert primes**: A prime $p \in \mathbb{Z}$ may remain prime in $\mathcal{O}_F$.
- **Ramification**: A prime $p$ can ramify, meaning $p \mathcal{O}_F = \mathfrak{p}^e$ where $e > 1$ and $\mathfrak{p}$ is a prime ideal in $\mathcal{O}_F$.

### 7. **Examples of Behavior of Primes**:
Consider the quadratic field $F = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-5})$. The ring of integers of this field is $\mathcal{O}_F = \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$.
- The prime number $3$ **remains inert**, meaning $3 \mathcal{O}_F$ remains prime.
- The prime number $2$ **ramifies**, meaning $2\mathcal{O}_F = \mathfrak{p}^2$ for some prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ in $\mathcal{O}_F$.
- The prime number $11$ **splits**, meaning $11\mathcal{O}_F = \mathfrak{p}_1 \mathfrak{p}_2$, where $\mathfrak{p}_1$ and $\mathfrak{p}_2$ are distinct prime ideals in $\mathcal{O}_F$.

### 8. **Galois Group of a Number Field**:
If a number field $F$ is a **Galois extension** of $\mathbb{Q}$, it comes equipped with a **Galois group**, denoted $\text{Gal}(F/\mathbb{Q})$. This group consists of all field automorphisms of $F$ that fix $\mathbb{Q}$ and has deep connections with [[class field theory]] and the [[Langlands program]].

- If $F = \mathbb{Q}(\zeta_n)$ is a cyclotomic field, where $\zeta_n$ is a primitive $n$th root of unity, then $\text{Gal}(F/\mathbb{Q}) \cong (\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})^\times$, the group of units modulo $n$.

### 9. **Class Field Theory**:
Class field theory is a major branch of number theory that describes abelian extensions of a number field in terms of its ideal class group and other invariants. The adeles and ideles of a number field, which are more advanced structures built from local completions of the number field, play a central role in class field theory.

### Summary:
- A **number field** is a finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}$.
- Examples include quadratic fields, cyclotomic fields, and more general algebraic extensions.
- Number fields have a **ring of integers** that generalizes the integers in $\mathbb{Q}$.
- Prime numbers in $\mathbb{Z}$ exhibit splitting, ramification, or inertia when considered in number fields.
- The **Galois group** of a number field reflects its symmetries and is a key object of study in [[class field theory]] and the [[Langlands program]].
