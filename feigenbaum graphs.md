# Feigenbaum Graphs

Feigenbaum graphs are visual representations that illustrate the [[period-doubling bifurcation]] phenomenon in [[chaotic systems]]. They are named after physicist [[Mitchell Feigenbaum]], who discovered universal constants that govern the transition from order to chaos in nonlinear dynamical systems.

## Mathematical Formalization

A Feigenbaum graph typically plots the stable periodic points of a [[parameterized family]] of [[nonlinear maps]] as the control parameter is varied. The most famous example uses the [[logistic map]]:

$$f_r(x) = rx(1-x)$$

where $x \in [0,1]$ represents the state variable and $r \in [0,4]$ is the control parameter.

## Structure and Interpretation

For a given value of $r$, we can generate a sequence by iteration:

$$x_{n+1} = f_r(x_n)$$

Starting from some initial value $x_0$. After discarding [[transient behavior]], we plot the set of values that $x$ settles into (the [[attractor]]) against the parameter value $r$.

The graph exhibits several key features:

1. For $0 < r < 1$, all trajectories converge to 0.
2. For $1 < r < 3$, trajectories converge to a single fixed point $x^* = 1-\frac{1}{r}$.
3. At $r = 3$, a [[bifurcation]] occurs, and the system develops a stable 2-cycle.
4. As $r$ increases further, period-doubling bifurcations occur at an accelerating rate, with periods of 4, 8, 16, etc.
5. Beyond a critical value $r_∞ ≈ 3.57$, we observe [[chaotic behavior]] interspersed with [[periodic windows]].

## Feigenbaum Constants

The most remarkable discovery associated with Feigenbaum graphs is the existence of universal constants that govern the transition to chaos:

### The Feigenbaum Delta Constant

$$\delta = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{r_n - r_{n-1}}{r_{n+1} - r_n} \approx 4.669201609...$$

where $r_n$ is the parameter value at which the $2^n$-cycle appears.

### The Feigenbaum Alpha Constant

$$\alpha = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{d_n}{d_{n+1}} \approx 2.502907875...$$

where $d_n$ measures the width of bifurcation branches at level $n$.

These constants are [[universal]] in that they appear in diverse systems undergoing period-doubling routes to chaos, regardless of the specific form of the [[unimodal map]].

## Symbolic Notation

We can develop a formal notation to describe the structure of a Feigenbaum graph:

- Let $\mathcal{B}(r) = \{x : x \text{ is an element of the attractor at parameter value } r\}$
- The [[period]] of the attractor: $P(r) = |\mathcal{B}(r)|$ for non-chaotic regimes
- The sequence of bifurcation points: $\{r_n\}_{n=0}^{\infty}$ where $P(r_n) = 2^n$
- The [[Lyapunov exponent]] $\lambda(r) = \lim_{N \to \infty} \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \ln|f'_r(x_i)|$, which becomes positive in chaotic regimes

## Applications

Feigenbaum graphs have applications in:

1. [[Population dynamics]] and ecological modeling
2. [[Financial time series]] analysis
3. [[Weather prediction]] and climate modeling
4. [[Neural network]] dynamics
5. [[Cryptography]] and [[pseudorandom number generation]]

## Self-Similarity and Fractal Structure

The Feigenbaum graph exhibits [[self-similarity]] and has a [[fractal structure]]. Magnifying regions of the chaotic regime reveals smaller copies of the entire bifurcation structure, a property known as [[scale invariance]].

This self-similarity can be quantified using the concept of [[Hausdorff dimension]], which for the Feigenbaum attractor has been calculated to be approximately 0.538.

## Computational Methods

Numerically generating a Feigenbaum graph requires:

1. Choosing a range of parameter values $[r_{\min}, r_{\max}]$
2. For each $r$ in this range:
   - Initialize $x_0$ (often $x_0 = 0.5$ is used)
   - Iterate $x_{n+1} = f_r(x_n)$ for $N_{\text{transient}}$ steps
   - Continue iterating for $N_{\text{plot}}$ more steps, adding each $x_n$ to the plot

Pseudocode for generating a Feigenbaum graph:

```python
def generate_feigenbaum_graph(r_min, r_max, r_steps, n_transient, n_plot):
    points = []
    for r in np.linspace(r_min, r_max, r_steps):
        x = 0.5  # Initial condition
        
        # Discard transients
        for _ in range(n_transient):
            x = r * x * (1 - x)
            
        # Collect points for plotting
        for _ in range(n_plot):
            x = r * x * (1 - x)
            points.append((r, x))
            
    return points
```

## Extensions to Higher Dimensions

While the classical Feigenbaum graph deals with one-dimensional maps, the concept extends to higher-dimensional systems:

- [[Hénon map]]: $x_{n+1} = 1 - ax_n^2 + y_n$, $y_{n+1} = bx_n$
- [[Lorenz system]]: $\dot{x} = \sigma(y - x)$, $\dot{y} = x(\rho - z) - y$, $\dot{z} = xy - \beta z$

These systems also exhibit period-doubling cascades and universal scaling, though with different constants and more complex attractors.
