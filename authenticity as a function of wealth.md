### Authenticity as a Function of Wealth

Authenticity, in a socio-economic context, refers to the genuine presentation of oneself and one's values without succumbing to external pressures or influences. The relationship between authenticity and wealth is multifaceted, involving psychological, sociological, and economic dimensions. Here, we explore this relationship through various lenses.

#### Psychological Perspective

From a psychological standpoint, the concept of authenticity is often tied to self-determination theory (SDT), which posits that individuals have innate psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Wealth can influence authenticity in the following ways:

1. **Autonomy and Wealth**: Greater wealth can provide individuals with the means to pursue activities and lifestyles that align with their true interests and values, thereby enhancing their sense of authenticity. The mathematical representation of this can be considered as:
   $$ \text{Authenticity} \propto \text{Autonomy} \propto \text{Wealth} $$

2. **Competence and Wealth**: Wealth can provide access to better education and resources, enhancing one's sense of competence. This, in turn, can bolster authentic behavior:
   $$ \text{Competence} \propto \text{Access to Resources} \propto \text{Wealth} $$
   $$ \text{Authenticity} \propto \text{Competence} $$

3. **Relatedness and Wealth**: While wealth can facilitate social connections
