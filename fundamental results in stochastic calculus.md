### Fundamental Results in Stochastic Calculus

Stochastic calculus is a branch of mathematics that deals with integrating and differentiating functions involving stochastic processes, particularly those involving Brownian motion. Here are some of the fundamental results and concepts in stochastic calculus:

### 1. **Brownian Motion**

Brownian motion (or Wiener process) \(W_t\) is a continuous-time stochastic process with the following properties:
- \(W_0 = 0\)
- \(W_t\) has independent increments: \(W_{t+s} - W_t\) is independent of the past values \( \{W_u : u \leq t \} \)
- \(W_t\) has stationary increments: \(W_{t+s} - W_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, s)\)
- \(W_t\) has continuous paths: \(W_t\) is almost surely continuous.

### 2. **Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs)**

SDEs describe the evolution of systems influenced by random noise. A general form of an SDE is:
$$
dX_t = \mu(X_t, t) dt + \sigma(X_t, t) dW_t
$$
where \( \mu(X_t, t) \) is the drift term, and \( \sigma(X_t, t) \) is the diffusion term.

### 3. **Ito's Lemma**

Ito's Lemma is a key result that extends the chain rule to stochastic processes. For a twice differentiable function \( f(X_t, t) \), where \( X_t \) follows an SDE \( dX_t = \mu(X_t, t) dt + \sigma(X_t, t) dW_t \), Ito's Lemma states:

$$
df(X_t, t) = \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial t} + \mu \frac{\partial f}{\partial X} + \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial X^2} \right) dt + \sigma \frac{\partial f}{\partial X} dW_t
$$

### 4. **Ito Integral**

The Ito integral extends the concept of integration to stochastic processes. For a stochastic process \( X_t \) and a non-anticipative process \( \phi(t) \), the Ito integral is defined as:

$$
\int_0^t \phi(s) dW_s = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \phi(t_i) \left( W(t_{i+1}) - W(t_i) \right)
$$

where \( t_0, t_1, \ldots, t_n \) is a partition of the interval \([0, t]\).

### 5. **Martingales**

A stochastic process \( M_t \) is a martingale if it satisfies:
- \( E[|M_t|] < \infty \) for all \( t \)
- \( E[M_{t+s} | \mathcal{F}_t] = M_t \) for all \( s \geq 0 \), where \( \mathcal{F}_t \) is the filtration representing the information available up to time \( t \).

### 6. **Girsanov's Theorem**

Girsanov's Theorem provides a method for changing the probability measure such that the drift term in an SDE is modified. Specifically, if \( W_t \) is a Brownian motion under the original measure \( P \) and \( \theta_t \) is an adapted process, then under a new measure \( Q \), the process:

$$
W_t^Q = W_t - \int_0^t \theta_s ds
$$

is a Brownian motion. This theorem is crucial for risk-neutral pricing in financial mathematics.

### 7. **Feynman-Kac Formula**

The Feynman-Kac formula links partial differential equations (PDEs) with expectations of stochastic processes. If \( u(x,t) \) solves the PDE:

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + \mathcal{L} u - r u = 0
$$

with final condition \( u(x,T) = g(x) \), where \( \mathcal{L} \) is the generator of the diffusion process, then \( u(x,t) \) can be represented as:

$$
u(x,t) = E^x \left[ e^{-r(T-t)} g(X_T) \mid X_t = x \right]
$$

### 8. **Doob's Martingale Inequalities**

Doob's inequalities provide bounds on the maximum value of a martingale. For a martingale \( M_t \) and \( p > 1 \):

$$
E \left[ \sup_{0 \leq s \leq t} |M_s|^p \right] \leq \left( \frac{p}{p-1} \right)^p E[|M_t|^p]
$$

### 9. **Stopping Times**

A stopping time \( \tau \) with respect to a filtration \( \mathcal{F}_t \) is a random variable such that the event \( \{ \tau \leq t \} \) is \( \mathcal{F}_t \)-measurable. The optional sampling theorem states that for a martingale \( M_t \) and a stopping time \( \tau \):

$$
E[M_\tau] = M_0
$$

### 10. **Quadratic Variation**

The quadratic variation of a process \( X_t \) is defined as:

$$
[X]_t = \lim_{||\pi|| \to 0} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (X_{t_{i+1}} - X_{t_i})^2
$$

For a Brownian motion \( W_t \), the quadratic variation is:

$$
[W]_t = t
$$

### Applications in Finance

Stochastic calculus is extensively used in financial mathematics for modeling asset prices, option pricing, and risk management. Some key applications include:

1. **Black-Scholes Model**: The Black-Scholes PDE for option pricing is derived using Ito's Lemma.
2. **Risk-Neutral Pricing**: Girsanov's Theorem is used to change the measure to a risk-neutral measure for pricing derivatives.
3. **Stochastic Volatility Models**: Models like Heston's model use SDEs to describe the evolution of volatility.

### Conclusion

Stochastic calculus provides the mathematical foundation for modeling and analyzing systems influenced by random noise. Fundamental results like Ito's Lemma, Girsanov's Theorem, and the Feynman-Kac Formula are essential tools for understanding the behavior of stochastic processes and their applications in various fields, particularly in finance.
