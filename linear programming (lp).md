### Linear Programming (LP)

Linear programming (LP) is a mathematical method used to determine the best possible outcome, such as maximum profit or lowest cost, in a mathematical model whose requirements are represented by linear relationships. It is a special case of mathematical programming and has applications in various fields, including economics, business, engineering, and military operations.

#### Key Concepts

1. **Objective Function**: The function to be optimized (maximized or minimized).
2. **Decision Variables**: The variables that influence the outcome of the objective function.
3. **Constraints**: Linear inequalities or equations that restrict the values of the decision variables.
4. **Feasible Region**: The set of all possible values of decision variables that satisfy all constraints.

#### Mathematical Formulation

A standard linear programming problem can be formulated as follows:

**Objective Function**:
$$
\text{Maximize or Minimize } Z = c_1x_1 + c_2x_2 + \cdots + c_nx_n
$$
where \( Z \) is the objective function, \( x_i \) are the decision variables, and \( c_i \) are the coefficients of the objective function.

**Constraints**:
$$
a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + \cdots + a_{1n}x_n \leq b_1
$$
$$
a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + \cdots + a_{2n}x_n \leq b_2
$$
$$
\vdots
$$
$$
a_{m1}x_1 + a_{m2}x_2 + \cdots + a_{mn}x_n \leq b_m
$$
where \( a_{ij} \) are the coefficients of the constraints, and \( b_j \) are the right-hand side values of the constraints.

**Non-Negativity Constraints**:
$$
x_i \geq 0 \quad \forall i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}
$$

#### Graphical Method

For problems with two decision variables, the graphical method can be used to find the optimal solution. The steps involved are:

1. **Plot the Constraints**: Draw the constraint lines on a graph.
2. **Identify the Feasible Region**: Determine the region where all constraints overlap.
3. **Plot the Objective Function**: Draw the objective function line.
4. **Optimize**: Move the objective function line parallel to itself to find the point in the feasible region that maximizes or minimizes the objective function.

#### Simplex Method

The Simplex method is an algorithm for solving linear programming problems with more than two decision variables. It systematically examines the vertices of the feasible region to find the optimal solution.

**Steps of the Simplex Method**:

1. **Initialize**: Convert the LP problem into standard form with slack variables.
2. **Set Up the Initial Simplex Tableau**: Create a tableau representing the initial system of equations.
3. **Pivot**: Identify the entering and leaving variables using the pivot operation.
4. **Iterate**: Perform row operations to update the tableau and move to a new vertex.
5. **Check for Optimality**: Repeat the pivoting process until the optimal solution is found or determine that no feasible solution exists.

#### Example

Suppose a company manufactures two products, A and B. Each product requires labor and material, and the company wants to maximize its profit.

Let:
- \( x_1 \) be the number of units of product A produced.
- \( x_2 \) be the number of units of product B produced.
- Profit per unit of product A be $40.
- Profit per unit of product B be $30.
- Labor required for product A be 2 hours per unit.
- Labor required for product B be 1 hour per unit.
- Material required for product A be 3 units per unit.
- Material required for product B be 2 units per unit.
- Total labor available be 100 hours.
- Total material available be 180 units.

**Formulation**:

**Objective Function**:
$$
\text{Maximize } Z = 40x_1 + 30x_2
$$

**Constraints**:
$$
2x_1 + x_2 \leq 100 \quad \text{(labor constraint)}
$$
$$
3x_1 + 2x_2 \leq 180 \quad \text{(material constraint)}
$$
$$
x_1, x_2 \geq 0 \quad \text{(non-negativity constraints)}
$$

**Simplex Method**:

1. **Convert to Standard Form**:
   Introduce slack variables \( s_1 \) and \( s_2 \) to convert inequalities to equations:
   $$
   2x_1 + x_2 + s_1 = 100
   $$
   $$
   3x_1 + 2x_2 + s_2 = 180
   $$

2. **Set Up Initial Simplex Tableau**:
   \[
   \begin{array}{c|cccc|c}
   & x_1 & x_2 & s_1 & s_2 & \text{RHS} \\
   \hline
   s_1 & 2 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 100 \\
   s_2 & 3 & 2 & 0 & 1 & 180 \\
   \hline
   Z & -40 & -30 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
   \end{array}
   \]

3. **Pivot and Iterate**:
   - Identify the entering variable (most negative coefficient in the objective row) and the leaving variable (using the minimum ratio test).
   - Perform row operations to update the tableau.
   - Repeat the process until all coefficients in the objective row are non-negative.

4. **Optimal Solution**:
   After iterations, the final tableau provides the optimal values of \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \).

#### Applications

1. **Manufacturing**: Optimizing production schedules and [[resource allocation]].
2. **Finance**: Portfolio optimization to maximize returns or minimize risk.
3. **Logistics**: Minimizing transportation costs and optimizing supply chains.
4. **Energy**: Optimizing power generation and distribution.
5. **Military Operations**: Allocating resources and planning operations efficiently.

#### Advanced Considerations

1. **Integer Linear Programming (ILP)**: When decision variables must be integers, additional constraints are introduced, leading to a more complex problem.
2. **Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP)**: Combines continuous and integer variables.
3. **Duality**: Each LP problem has a corresponding dual problem with a structure that provides insights into the original problem.
4. **Sensitivity Analysis**: Examines how changes in the coefficients of the objective function or constraints affect the optimal solution.

#### Conclusion

Linear programming is a powerful optimization tool with a wide range of applications in various fields. By formulating problems with linear relationships and applying methods like the Simplex algorithm, organizations can make informed decisions to achieve their goals efficiently. Advanced topics like ILP, MILP, duality, and [[sensitivity analysis]] further extend the capabilities of linear programming in solving complex real-world problems.
