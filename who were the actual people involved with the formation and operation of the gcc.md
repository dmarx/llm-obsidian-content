Who were the actual people involved with the formation and operation of the GCC?


**ASSISTANT**

The Global Climate Coalition (GCC) was primarily composed of major corporations and trade associations from industries with significant interests in fossil fuels, such as oil, coal, and automotive sectors. While specific individuals who were directly involved in the formation and operation of the GCC are not as prominently documented, the organizations and their representatives played critical roles in driving its agenda.

### Key Organizations and Representatives Involved in the GCC

3. **Scientific and Policy Advisors**
   - **Role**: Providing ostensibly independent expert opinions that aligned with the coalition’s objectives, often challenging mainstream climate science.
   - **Key Figures**: Scientists and policy analysts, some of whom were financially supported by the GCC or its members, played a role in creating doubt about climate change.

### Documented Involvement and Public Disclosure

While individual names are less frequently highlighted in public records, some notable figures associated with GCC activities and its member organizations have been documented:

- **Lee Raymond**: Then CEO of ExxonMobil, Raymond was a vocal skeptic of climate change and influential in steering ExxonMobil’s support for the GCC.

- **John Shlaes**: Serving as the Executive Director of the GCC, Shlaes coordinated the coalition’s activities and public relations efforts.

### Conclusion

The Global Climate Coalition was a significant force in the climate change debate during the 1990s, driven by the collective efforts of major fossil fuel companies and trade associations. While specific individuals behind the scenes were often not as prominently named in public disclosures, the organizations and their leadership teams played pivotal roles in shaping the coalition’s strategies and actions. Understanding the institutional dynamics and the roles of these key players helps illuminate the broader tactics employed to influence public opinion and policy on climate change.
