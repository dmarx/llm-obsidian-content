second order volitions


**ASSISTANT**

**Second-order volitions** are a crucial concept in **Harry Frankfurt's theory of free will**, representing a key element that differentiates humans from animals and explains the structure of **authentic choice** and **moral responsibility**. To fully grasp the role of second-order volitions, it’s helpful to understand how they fit within Frankfurt’s larger framework of **first-order desires** and **second-order desires**.

### 1. **First-Order Desires**
A **first-order desire** is a basic desire to do something or to achieve a certain goal. These desires arise naturally in response to our environment or internal states.

- **Examples**:
  - A desire to eat when hungry.
  - A desire to watch television to relax.
  - A desire to smoke a cigarette.

In general, **first-order desires** are common to all creatures with a capacity for intentional behavior, including non-human animals. They represent the most basic level of desire that prompts action.

### 2. **Second-Order Desires**
A **second-order desire** is a **desire about a first-order desire**. It involves the capacity to reflect on your first-order desires and ask yourself whether you **want** to be moved by them or not.

- **Examples**:
  - A person may have a **first-order desire** to eat junk food but a **second-order desire** not to act on that first-order desire because they value their health.
  - Someone might have a **first-order desire** to procrastinate but a **second-order desire** to overcome procrastination because they want to be productive.

Second-order desires reflect a level of **self-reflection** or **evaluation** of our basic urges. This reflective capacity is a significant aspect of human agency, allowing individuals to examine which of their desires are consistent with their long-term goals, values, or identity.

### 3. **Second-Order Volitions: The Key to Free Will**
A **second-order volition** is a special kind of second-order desire. While a second-order desire is merely about **whether you want to act** on a first-order desire, a **second-order volition** is a desire that a **specific first-order desire** should actually become effective in moving you to act.

In Frankfurt’s model, **second-order volitions** are what differentiate people with **free will** from those without it.

#### **Definition**:
- A **second-order volition** is when you **want** a particular first-order desire to be the one that governs your action.
- In other words, you **endorse** a specific desire at a reflective level and want it to control your behavior.

This distinction between second-order desires and second-order volitions is crucial. One can have a second-order desire without having a second-order volition. For example, you might wish you didn’t want to smoke, but you don’t necessarily want that desire to be strong enough to stop you from smoking. Only when you actively **want** the desire not to smoke to govern your actions (and act accordingly) does it become a **second-order volition**.

#### **Example**: 
- **The Addict**: Imagine a drug addict who has a **first-order desire** to take drugs. They may also have a **second-order desire** to stop using drugs because they recognize it’s harmful. However, a second-order desire alone is not enough for them to stop. If the addict wants their **desire to stop using drugs** to govern their actions (meaning they wish this desire would control their behavior and prevent them from using drugs), then they have a **second-order volition**.

However, if the addict still ends up taking the drugs despite wishing they didn’t want to, they lack **free will** because their second-order volition (the desire to quit) isn’t effective in controlling their actions. Thus, their first-order desire (to take drugs) wins, even though their second-order volition is opposed to it.

### 4. **Freedom of the Will**
For Frankfurt, **free will** is not simply about acting on your desires (since animals can act on their desires too). Instead, it’s about the alignment between **your first-order desires and your second-order volitions**.

- You have **free will** when the first-order desire that moves you to act is the one you **want** to move you to act. 
- You lack **free will** when you act on a first-order desire that **contradicts** your second-order volitions.

This means that having **free will** requires being able to **reflectively endorse** the desires that govern your actions. The crucial point is that freedom of will is not about the absence of external constraints, but about whether your will reflects what you **truly want** at a higher level of reflection.

### 5. **Second-Order Volitions and Moral Responsibility**

Frankfurt’s theory has important implications for **moral responsibility**. People are morally responsible for their actions when they act on first-order desires that are aligned with their second-order volitions.

- If you act on a first-order desire that you want to govern your action (in accordance with your second-order volition), then you are acting freely and can be held morally responsible.
- On the other hand, if you act on a first-order desire that conflicts with your second-order volitions, you may not be fully responsible for that action because it does not reflect your **authentic self**.

For example:
- A compulsive gambler might feel unable to resist their first-order desire to gamble, but at the same time, they might have a second-order volition to stop gambling because they know it is destructive. If the compulsive gambler cannot align their behavior with their second-order volition, their **moral responsibility** might be diminished because they lack the capacity to act in accordance with what they reflectively endorse.

### 6. **Applications and Examples**

#### **Addiction and Compulsive Behavior**
In cases of addiction or compulsive behavior, individuals often experience a conflict between their first-order desires and their second-order volitions:
- The **first-order desire** (e.g., to consume alcohol, drugs, or pornography) may be strong and immediate.
- However, the individual may have a **second-order volition** to stop engaging in the behavior (because they rationally recognize the harm or want to align their actions with their long-term goals).

The inability to act in accordance with second-order volitions is a hallmark of **compulsive behavior**, where the individual’s **will** is not truly free. In such cases, therapy or other interventions often aim to strengthen the connection between second-order volitions and behavior.

#### **Self-Control and Autonomy**
**Self-control** is closely related to Frankfurt’s notion of second-order volitions. When we exercise self-control, we are attempting to bring our actions in line with our second-order volitions:
- For example, someone who wants to **lose weight** might have a **first-order desire** to eat unhealthy food but a **second-order volition** to resist that urge because they value their health. When they exercise self-control, they are aligning their actions with their second-order volition, which Frankfurt would describe as an exercise of free will.

In this way, **autonomy** involves the ability to act in accordance with one's **reflective, higher-order desires**, rather than being driven by immediate impulses or urges.

#### **Moral Integrity and Character**
In terms of **moral integrity**, Frankfurt's model suggests that a person of strong moral character is someone whose actions consistently align with their **second-order volitions**. Such a person acts in a way that reflects their **considered values and commitments**, rather than being led by conflicting or base desires.

### 7. **Criticisms and Extensions of Frankfurt’s Theory**

While Frankfurt’s theory of second-order volitions is widely influential, it has also faced criticisms and sparked further debate:

#### **Infinite Regress**:
- A common criticism is the potential for an **infinite regress**: if we need second-order volitions to explain free will, what stops us from needing **third-order desires** to reflect on second-order volitions, and so on? Frankfurt responds that second-order volitions are sufficient because they represent our reflective capacity to shape our will.

#### **External and Social Influences**:
- Frankfurt’s model focuses primarily on **internal conflicts** (between different desires) but may not fully address how **external factors** (social pressures, environmental constraints, or coercion) can affect our ability to act in line with our second-order volitions. For example, what if societal pressures cause us to have certain second-order volitions that we might not have in a different environment?

Despite these criticisms, Frankfurt’s model remains highly influential in discussions of **free will**, **moral responsibility**, and **personal agency**.

### Conclusion

**Second-order volitions** are central to Harry Frankfurt’s theory of **free will**. They allow individuals to reflect on their desires and determine which of their first-order desires they want to govern their actions. In this way, second-order volitions are a key to understanding **authentic choice** and **moral responsibility**.

According to Frankfurt, a person has **free will** when their actions align with their second-order volitions—when they act on the desires they reflectively endorse. In cases where individuals act against their second-order volitions (such as in addiction or compulsive behavior), they lack free will in the full sense because their actions do not reflect what they truly want at a higher level of reflection.

By differentiating between **freedom of action** and **freedom of will**, Frankfurt provides a framework that helps explain how people can be constrained by internal conflicts, yet still retain some form of agency and moral responsibility, depending on their ability to act in line with their higher-order desires.
