## Spectral Theorem for Compact Operators on Hilbert Spaces

The Spectral Theorem for compact operators on Hilbert spaces is a powerful generalization of the finite-dimensional spectral theorem to infinite-dimensional settings. It applies to a class of operators known as compact operators, which, intuitively, can be thought of as operators that "compress" infinite-dimensional spaces in a way similar to how matrices act on finite-dimensional spaces.

### Statement of the Theorem

Let \( T \) be a compact, self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space \( \mathcal{H} \). The Spectral Theorem for compact operators can be stated as follows:

*If \( T \) is a compact, self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space \( \mathcal{H} \), then \( T \) has a countable set of real eigenvalues \( \{\lambda_i\} \) with corresponding orthonormal eigenvectors \( \{\phi_i\} \) in \( \mathcal{H} \). These eigenvalues accumulate only at 0, and \( T \) can be expressed as:*

$$
T = \sum_{i} \lambda_i \langle \cdot, \phi_i \rangle \phi_i
$$

*where the sum converges in the norm operator topology.*

### Detailed Explanation

#### Compact Operators

An operator \( T: \mathcal{H} \to \mathcal{H} \) is compact if it maps bounded sets to relatively compact sets, meaning the closure of the image of any bounded set under \( T \) is compact.

#### Self-Adjointness

An operator \( T \) is self-adjoint if \( T = T^* \), where \( T^* \) denotes the adjoint operator of \( T \).

### Mathematical Formalism

Let \( T \) be a compact, self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space \( \mathcal{H} \). Then the following holds:

1. **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**:
    - There exists a sequence of real eigenvalues \( \{\lambda_i\} \) of \( T \).
    - Corresponding to each non-zero eigenvalue \( \lambda_i \), there exists an orthonormal eigenvector \( \phi_i \in \mathcal{H} \) such that \( T \phi_i = \lambda_i \phi_i \).

2. **Spectral Decomposition**:
    - The operator \( T \) can be decomposed as:
      $$
      T = \sum_{i} \lambda_i \langle \cdot, \phi_i \rangle \phi_i
      $$
    - The sum converges in the norm operator topology, meaning for any \( x \in \mathcal{H} \), the series \( \sum_{i} \lambda_i \langle x, \phi_i \rangle \phi_i \) converges in \( \mathcal{H} \).

3. **Accumulation at Zero**:
    - The eigenvalues \( \{\lambda_i\} \) accumulate only at 0. This means that, except for possibly 0, there are only finitely many distinct eigenvalues.

### Implications and Applications

#### Diagonalization

The spectral theorem implies that a compact, self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space can be "diagonalized" in terms of its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, much like finite-dimensional Hermitian matrices.

#### Functional Calculus

For compact, self-adjoint operators, the spectral theorem enables the definition of functions of the operator via its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. If \( f \) is a continuous function, \( f(T) \) can be defined by:

$$
f(T) = \sum_{i} f(\lambda_i) \langle \cdot, \phi_i \rangle \phi_i
$$

#### Applications in Quantum Mechanics and Differential Equations

The spectral theorem is fundamental in quantum mechanics, where operators representing observables are often modeled as compact, self-adjoint operators. It also plays a crucial role in the study of differential operators and the solutions of partial differential equations.

### Example

Consider the integral operator \( T \) on \( L^2([0, 1]) \) defined by:

$$
(T f)(x) = \int_0^1 k(x, y) f(y) \, dy
$$

where \( k(x, y) \) is a continuous symmetric kernel. \( T \) is a compact, self-adjoint operator. According to the spectral theorem, there exists a sequence of eigenvalues \( \{\lambda_i\} \) and corresponding orthonormal eigenvectors \( \{\phi_i\} \) such that:

$$
k(x, y) = \sum_{i} \lambda_i \phi_i(x) \phi_i(y)
$$

and the operator can be expressed as:

$$
(T f)(x) = \sum_{i} \lambda_i \langle f, \phi_i \rangle \phi_i(x)
$$

The Spectral Theorem for compact operators on Hilbert spaces thus extends the powerful spectral decomposition technique from finite-dimensional spaces to infinite-dimensional settings, enabling a deeper understanding and manipulation of such operators.
