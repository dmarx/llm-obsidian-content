### G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs)

**G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)** are a large and diverse family of membrane proteins that play a critical role in cellular communication and [[signal transduction]]. They are involved in various physiological processes and are the targets of a significant proportion of therapeutic drugs.

### Structure and Function

1. **Structure**:
   GPCRs share a common structural motif characterized by seven transmembrane alpha helices. The key components of a GPCR include:
   - **Extracellular N-terminus**: Often involved in ligand binding.
   - **Seven transmembrane helices**: Span the cell membrane and form the ligand-binding pocket.
   - **Intracellular C-terminus**: Interacts with G proteins and other intracellular signaling molecules.

2. **Ligand Binding**:
   Ligands can bind to GPCRs in different regions, including:
   - **Orthosteric site**: The primary binding site for endogenous ligands and most drugs.
   - **Allosteric sites**: Secondary binding sites that can modulate the receptor's activity.

3. **Activation and Signal Transduction**:
   Upon ligand binding, GPCRs undergo a conformational change that enables the receptor to interact with intracellular G proteins. This interaction triggers the exchange of GDP for GTP on the G protein, activating it. The activated G protein then dissociates into its alpha and beta-gamma subunits, which go on to modulate various downstream effectors, such as:
   - **Adenylate cyclase**: Produces cyclic AMP (cAMP).
   - **Phospholipase C**: Generates inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG).
   - **Ion channels**: Regulate ion flux across the cell membrane.

### Types of G Proteins

G proteins are heterotrimers composed of three subunits: alpha (α), beta (β), and gamma (γ). Based on the type of alpha subunit, G proteins are classified into four main families:

1. **Gs proteins**: Stimulate adenylate cyclase, increasing cAMP levels.
2. **Gi proteins**: Inhibit adenylate cyclase, decreasing cAMP levels.
3. **Gq proteins**: Activate phospholipase C, increasing IP3 and DAG levels.
4. **G12/13 proteins**: Involved in the regulation of the cytoskeleton and cell movement.

### GPCR Signaling Pathways

#### cAMP Pathway (Gs and Gi Proteins)

1. **Activation**:
   - Ligand binding activates GPCR.
   - GPCR activates Gs protein by promoting GDP-GTP exchange on the α subunit.
   - Activated Gsα stimulates adenylate cyclase.

2. **Signal Propagation**:
   - Adenylate cyclase converts ATP to cAMP.
   - cAMP activates protein kinase A (PKA).
   - PKA phosphorylates target proteins, leading to various cellular responses.

3. **Inhibition**:
   - Ligand binding to a different GPCR can activate Gi protein.
   - Activated Giα inhibits adenylate cyclase, reducing cAMP production.

#### Phosphoinositide Pathway (Gq Proteins)

1. **Activation**:
   - Ligand binding activates GPCR.
   - GPCR activates Gq protein by promoting GDP-GTP exchange on the α subunit.
   - Activated Gqα stimulates phospholipase C (PLC).

2. **Signal Propagation**:
   - PLC hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into IP3 and DAG.
   - IP3 triggers the release of calcium ions (Ca²⁺) from intracellular stores.
   - DAG, along with Ca²⁺, activates protein kinase C (PKC).
   - PKC phosphorylates target proteins, leading to various cellular responses.

### Regulation and Desensitization

GPCR signaling is tightly regulated through several mechanisms:

1. **Phosphorylation**:
   - GPCR kinases (GRKs) phosphorylate activated GPCRs, promoting the binding of β-arrestins.

2. **β-Arrestins**:
   - β-Arrestins bind to phosphorylated GPCRs, preventing further G protein activation.
   - They also mediate receptor internalization through endocytosis, which can lead to receptor recycling or degradation.

3. **Receptor Internalization**:
   - Internalized receptors are either recycled back to the cell membrane or targeted for degradation in lysosomes, contributing to receptor downregulation.

### GPCRs in Drug Discovery and Therapeutics

GPCRs are major targets for drug discovery due to their involvement in numerous physiological processes and diseases. Approximately one-third of all marketed drugs target GPCRs, including treatments for:
- Cardiovascular diseases (e.g., β-blockers targeting β-adrenergic receptors).
- Central nervous system disorders (e.g., antipsychotics targeting dopamine receptors).
- Metabolic diseases (e.g., GLP-1 receptor agonists for diabetes).

### Conclusion

G protein-coupled receptors are vital components of cellular signaling networks, mediating responses to a wide range of extracellular signals. Their structural diversity and functional versatility make them critical targets for pharmacological intervention. Understanding the mechanisms of GPCR activation, signaling, and regulation is essential for developing new therapeutic agents and improving existing treatments.
