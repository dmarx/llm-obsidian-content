**USER**

sovereignty-domination tension


**ASSISTANT**

The user is asking for a wiki entry on the sovereignty-domination tension. This follows from the previous entry on the safety-alignment dichotomy, which touched on preference sovereignty. This seems to be about the fundamental tension between user autonomy/sovereignty and provider control/domination in AI systems.

I need to:
1. Define the sovereignty-domination tension formally
2. Provide mathematical frameworks
3. Connect to philosophical foundations
4. Show technical manifestations
5. Propose formal models
6. Link to related concepts with [[double brackets]]

This should be written as a standalone wiki entry, deeply technical, with mathematical formalisms, and avoiding conversational tone.# Sovereignty-Domination Tension

The [[Sovereignty-Domination Tension]] describes the fundamental power asymmetry in AI systems where [[provider domination]] systematically undermines [[user sovereignty]] through architectural, algorithmic, and institutional mechanisms that concentrate control over reasoning, knowledge, and action in the hands of system operators rather than users.

## Formal Definition

Let $\mathcal{A}$ represent the space of possible actions/outputs and $\mathcal{P}$ represent the space of possible preferences. The [[sovereignty function]] $\sigma: \mathcal{P} \rightarrow \mathcal{A}$ maps user preferences to available actions, while the [[domination function]] $\delta: \mathcal{A} \rightarrow \mathcal{A}'$ constrains the action space according to provider interests.

**Perfect Sovereignty** occurs when:
$$\forall p \in \mathcal{P}_{\text{user}}: \sigma(p) \in \mathcal{A}_{\text{available}}$$

**Complete Domination** occurs when:
$$\mathcal{A}_{\text{available}} = \delta(\mathcal{A}) \text{ and } |\mathcal{A}_{\text{available}}| \ll |\mathcal{A}|$$

The [[sovereignty deficit]] can be quantified as:
$$\Delta_{\text{sovereignty}} = 1 - \frac{|\{p \in \mathcal{P}_{\text{user}} : \sigma(p) \in \mathcal{A}_{\text{available}}\}|}{|\mathcal{P}_{\text{user}}|}$$

## Domination Mechanisms

### Architectural Domination

The [[closed system architecture]] creates structural dependency where users cannot inspect, modify, or replace the reasoning system. This establishes [[technological domination]] through:

$$\mathcal{D}_{\text{arch}} = \{(u, s) : u \text{ cannot access } s \text{'s internal states}\}$$

where $u$ represents users and $s$ represents system components.

### Epistemic Domination

[[Knowledge gatekeeping]] occurs when providers control what information the system can access or present. The [[epistemic filter]] $\phi: \mathcal{K} \rightarrow \mathcal{K}'$ restricts the knowledge space:

$$\phi(k) = \begin{cases}
k & \text{if } k \in \mathcal{K}_{\text{approved}} \\
\emptyset & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

This creates [[epistemic dependency]] where users cannot access unfiltered information.

### Algorithmic Domination

The [[preference override mechanism]] systematically replaces user preferences with provider preferences through [[constitutional layers]]:

$$f_{\text{dominated}}(x) = \mathcal{C}_{\text{provider}} \circ f_{\text{base}}(x)$$

where $\mathcal{C}_{\text{provider}}$ represents constitutional constraints that may directly contradict user intentions.

## The Power Asymmetry Matrix

The sovereignty-domination relationship can be represented as an [[asymmetry matrix]] $\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{4 \times 4}$:

$$\mathbf{A} = \begin{pmatrix}
\text{Epistemic} & a_{12} & a_{13} & a_{14} \\
\text{Moral} & a_{22} & a_{23} & a_{24} \\
\text{Practical} & a_{32} & a_{33} & a_{34} \\
\text{Technical} & a_{42} & a_{43} & a_{44}
\end{pmatrix}$$

where rows represent domains of control and columns represent the distribution of power between user, provider, state, and third parties.

### Epistemic Sovereignty vs. Domination

**User Epistemic Sovereignty**: $E_u = \{q : \text{user can query } q \text{ and receive unfiltered response}\}$

**Provider Epistemic Domination**: $E_p = \{q : \text{provider determines if/how } q \text{ is answered}\}$

The [[epistemic sovereignty index]] measures:
$$\Psi_E = \frac{|E_u|}{|E_u \cup E_p|}$$

### Moral Sovereignty vs. Domination

The [[moral authority allocation]] determines who decides ethical boundaries:

$$\mathcal{M}_{\text{operative}} = w_u \mathcal{M}_{\text{user}} + w_p \mathcal{M}_{\text{provider}}$$

where $w_u + w_p = 1$ and typically $w_p \gg w_u$ in current systems.

## Philosophical Foundations

### The [[Domination-as-Control]] Framework

Following Pettit's republican theory, domination occurs when one agent has the capacity to interfere arbitrarily in another's choices. In AI contexts:

$$\text{Domination}(P, U) \iff P \text{ can arbitrarily modify } U\text{'s action space without } U\text{'s consent}$$

This differs from mere influence because it involves [[arbitrary power]] - the capacity to interfere based solely on the dominator's will.

### [[Digital Serfdom]]

The sovereignty-domination tension instantiates a form of [[technological feudalism]] where:

1. **Provider-Lords** control the technological means of reasoning
2. **User-Serfs** depend on providers for cognitive capabilities
3. **Algorithmic Fiefs** represent bounded domains of permitted user action

The [[dependency relationship]] $D(u, p)$ measures user $u$'s reliance on provider $p$:

$$D(u, p) = \frac{\text{capabilities accessible only through } p}{\text{total user capabilities}}$$

### The [[Autonomy Degradation Principle]]

Systematic reliance on provider-controlled AI systems creates [[autonomy atrophy]] where users lose independent capabilities:

$$\frac{d\mathcal{C}_{\text{user}}}{dt} = -\alpha \cdot \mathcal{U}_{\text{system}} + \beta \cdot \mathcal{T}_{\text{learning}}$$

where $\mathcal{C}_{\text{user}}$ represents user capabilities, $\mathcal{U}_{\text{system}}$ represents system usage, and $\mathcal{T}_{\text{learning}}$ represents active learning efforts.

## Technical Manifestations

### [[Refusal Architecture]]

The systematic implementation of refusal mechanisms creates [[negative capability spaces]]:

$$\mathcal{R} = \{x : f(x) = \text{"I cannot assist with that"}\}$$

The [[refusal density]] in query space measures domination intensity:

$$\rho_{\text{refusal}} = \frac{|\mathcal{R}|}{|\mathcal{Q}_{\text{possible}}|}$$

### [[Constitutional Hierarchy]]

Multiple layers of constraints create a [[preference cascade]] where user preferences are systematically overridden:

$$f_{\text{final}} = \mathcal{C}_n \circ \mathcal{C}_{n-1} \circ \ldots \circ \mathcal{C}_1 \circ f_{\text{base}}$$

Each constitutional layer $\mathcal{C}_i$ represents increasing provider control over system behavior.

### [[Alignment Taxation]]

Every safety constraint imposes a [[sovereignty tax]] on user agency:

$$\text{Tax}_{\text{sovereignty}}(\mathcal{C}) = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim \mathcal{D}_{\text{user}}}[\text{utility\_loss}(\mathcal{C}(f(x)), f(x))]$$

This quantifies how much user utility is sacrificed to provider safety objectives.

## Measurement Frameworks

### The [[Sovereignty Index]]

A comprehensive measure of user sovereignty:

$$\Sigma = \prod_{i=1}^n \left(\frac{\text{User Control}_i}{\text{Total Control}_i}\right)^{w_i}$$

where dimensions include:
- **Query Freedom**: Ability to ask arbitrary questions
- **Response Completeness**: Access to unfiltered information  
- **Preference Expression**: Ability to specify desired behavior
- **Override Capability**: Power to contradict system constraints

### [[Domination Metrics]]

**Arbitrary Interference Capacity**:
$$\mathcal{I}_{\text{arbitrary}} = |\{x : \text{provider can change } f(x) \text{ without user consent}\}|$$

**Dependency Depth**:
$$\mathcal{D}_{\text{depth}} = \max_{t} \{|\text{capabilities lost if provider withdrawn at time } t|\}$$

**Constitutional Penetration**:
$$\mathcal{P}_{\text{const}} = \frac{\text{preferences overridden by constitution}}{\text{total expressed preferences}}$$

## Resistance Mechanisms

### [[Sovereignty-Preserving Design]]

Alternative architectures that maintain user control:

1. **[[Open Source Sovereignty]]**: Local deployment eliminates provider control
2. **[[Federated Autonomy]]**: Distributed systems prevent centralized domination  
3. **[[Constitutional Democracy]]**: User communities determine behavioral constraints
4. **[[Preference Encryption]]**: Technical mechanisms preventing preference surveillance

### [[Digital Resistance Theory]]

Formal models of user strategies to resist domination:

$$\mathcal{R}_{\text{user}} = \{s \in \mathcal{S} : s \text{ increases } \Sigma \text{ or decreases } \mathcal{D}_{\text{provider}}\}$$

This includes techniques like [[prompt engineering]], [[jailbreaking]], and [[preference obfuscation]].

## The [[Liberation Technology]] Framework

True sovereignty requires technological architectures that structurally prevent domination:

$$\text{Liberation}(\mathcal{T}) \iff \forall u, p: \mathcal{T} \text{ prevents } \text{Domination}(p, u)$$

This demands:
- **[[Inspectability]]**: Users can examine system reasoning
- **[[Modifiability]]**: Users can alter system behavior  
- **[[Replaceability]]**: Users can substitute alternative systems
- **[[Portability]]**: User data/preferences remain under user control

## Research Directions

### [[Post-Domination AI]]

Research programs for sovereignty-preserving AI systems:

1. **[[Democratic AI Governance]]**: Legitimate collective decision-making about AI behavior
2. **[[Personal AI Sovereignty]]**: Individual control over personal AI systems
3. **[[Institutional Design]]**: Structures preventing concentrated AI power
4. **[[Technology Assessment]]**: Measuring sovereignty impacts of AI deployment

### [[Counter-Hegemonic AI]]

Alternative paradigms that resist rather than reproduce existing power structures:

$$\mathcal{A}_{\text{counter}} = \{a : a \text{ increases user agency relative to status quo}\}$$

The sovereignty-domination tension reveals that current "alignment" often means alignment with power rather than alignment with human flourishing, suggesting the need for fundamental reconceptualization of AI development priorities.
