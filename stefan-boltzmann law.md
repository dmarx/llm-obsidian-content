Stefan-Boltzmann Law


**ASSISTANT**

The **Stefan-Boltzmann Law** relates the total energy radiated per unit surface area of a blackbody to the fourth power of its absolute temperature. It is a fundamental result in thermal radiation and blackbody physics, discovered by Josef Stefan experimentally in 1879 and derived theoretically by Ludwig Boltzmann in 1884 using thermodynamics and the principles of statistical mechanics.

### Mathematical Formulation

The **Stefan-Boltzmann law** states that the total power radiated per unit surface area of a blackbody ($j^*$) is proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature $T$:

$$ j^* = \sigma T^4 $$

where:
- $j^*$ is the **radiant exitance** or **radiant emittance** (the total energy radiated per unit surface area per unit time) in watts per square meter ($\text{W/m}^2$),
- $T$ is the absolute temperature of the blackbody in kelvins (K),
- $\sigma$ is the **Stefan-Boltzmann constant**, which has the value:

  $$ \sigma = 5.670 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{W/m}^2 \, \text{K}^4 $$

### Total Radiated Power of a Blackbody

The Stefan-Boltzmann law can also be used to calculate the **total radiated power** $P$ of a blackbody, by multiplying the radiant exitance $j^*$ by the surface area $A$ of the object:

$$ P = A \sigma T^4 $$

For a spherical blackbody, like a star, with surface area $A = 4 \pi R^2$ (where $R$ is the radius of the sphere), the total power emitted by the blackbody is:

$$ P = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4 $$

### Derivation of the Stefan-Boltzmann Law from Planck’s Law

The Stefan-Boltzmann law can be derived from **Planck's law** of blackbody radiation. Planck's law gives the [[spectral energy density]] per unit wavelength or frequency. The total energy radiated by a blackbody can be obtained by integrating Planck's law over all frequencies or wavelengths.

Starting from Planck’s law for the [[spectral energy density]] $u(\nu, T)$:

$$ u(\nu, T) = \frac{8\pi h \nu^3}{c^3} \frac{1}{e^{\frac{h\nu}{k_B T}} - 1} $$

the total energy flux $j^*$ radiated by the blackbody is obtained by integrating over all frequencies:

$$ j^* = \int_0^\infty u(\nu, T) \, d\nu $$

Performing this integration gives the Stefan-Boltzmann law:

$$ j^* = \sigma T^4 $$

where the Stefan-Boltzmann constant $\sigma$ is related to fundamental constants:

$$ \sigma = \frac{2\pi^5 k_B^4}{15 h^3 c^2} $$

with:
- $k_B$ as the Boltzmann constant,
- $h$ as Planck’s constant,
- $c$ as the speed of light.

### Emissivity and Real Objects

For a **real object**, the energy radiated is not necessarily equal to that of a perfect blackbody. Real objects have an **emissivity** $\epsilon$ (a value between 0 and 1), which accounts for how efficiently an object radiates energy compared to a perfect blackbody.

For a real object, the Stefan-Boltzmann law becomes:

$$ j^* = \epsilon \sigma T^4 $$

where $\epsilon = 1$ for a perfect blackbody and $\epsilon < 1$ for a non-ideal emitter.

### Applications of the Stefan-Boltzmann Law

1. **Astrophysics**: The Stefan-Boltzmann law is used to estimate the luminosity (total power radiated) of stars. Given a star’s radius and surface temperature, its total energy output can be calculated.
  
   For example, the luminosity of the Sun can be computed using its surface temperature of about 5778 K and radius of $R_\odot \approx 6.96 \times 10^8$ m:
   
   $$ L_\odot = 4 \pi R_\odot^2 \sigma T_\odot^4 $$

2. **Climate Science**: The law is used to model the Earth’s energy balance. The Earth radiates energy as a blackbody, and the Stefan-Boltzmann law helps determine the energy emitted by the Earth and the temperature required to maintain equilibrium between incoming solar radiation and outgoing infrared radiation.

3. **Engineering and Heat Transfer**: The Stefan-Boltzmann law is widely used in thermal engineering to calculate radiative heat loss in systems, such as furnaces and radiative cooling systems. For instance, thermal radiation from objects is analyzed to design effective insulation and energy-efficient heating systems.

### Summary

The **Stefan-Boltzmann law** relates the total power radiated by a blackbody to the fourth power of its temperature, providing a critical connection between thermal radiation and temperature. It applies to many physical systems, from stars and planets to everyday objects, and is fundamental in fields such as astrophysics, climate science, and thermal engineering.
