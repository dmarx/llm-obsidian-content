common expressions where someone means something substantively different from what they said/described and it is understand what they meant because of context or intonation or whatever.


**ASSISTANT**

Certainly! This phenomenon is known as *[[pragmatic inference]]*, where the meaning inferred from the context, intonation, or other cues differs from the literal meaning of the words used. Here are some common examples:

1. **Irony/Sarcasm:**
   - *Literal meaning*: "Great job on the report."
   - *Intended meaning*: "The report is actually quite poor."
   - *Context/Intonation*: Delivered with a tone or context that clearly indicates dissatisfaction.

2. **Understatement:**
   - *Literal meaning*: "It's a bit chilly today."
   - *Intended meaning*: "It's freezing."
   - *Context/Intonation*: Used when the weather is extremely cold, and the speaker's tone is somewhat exaggerated in its mildness.

3. **Overstatement:**
   - *Literal meaning*: "I've told you a million times."
   - *Intended meaning*: "I've told you many times."
   - *Context/Intonation*: An exaggerated number is used to stress the frequency of repetition.

4. **Euphemism:**
   - *Literal meaning*: "He passed away."
   - *Intended meaning*: "He died."
   - *Context/Intonation*: A more gentle phrase used to soften the harsh reality.

5. **Politeness Strategies:**
   - *Literal meaning*: "Could you close the window?"
   - *Intended meaning*: "Please close the window."
   - *Context/Intonation*: Framed as a question to be polite, but understood as a request.

6. **Hyperbole:**
   - *Literal meaning*: "I could eat a horse."
   - *Intended meaning*: "I'm very hungry."
   - *Context/Intonation*: The exaggeration is obvious given the context of hunger.

7. **Litotes:**
   - *Literal meaning*: "He's not the worst student."
   - *Intended meaning*: "He's a good student."
   - *Context/Intonation*: Using a negative form to affirm a positive quality.

8. **Indirect Requests:**
   - *Literal meaning*: "It's really noisy here."
   - *Intended meaning*: "Please lower the volume."
   - *Context/Intonation*: The statement about noise serves as a hint for action.

9. **Contextual Ambiguity:**
   - *Literal meaning*: "Can you reach the shelf?"
   - *Intended meaning*: Depends on contextâ€”could be a question about ability or a request to get something from the shelf.
   - *Context/Intonation*: The surrounding conversation usually clarifies the intent.

10. **Conventional Implicature:**
    - *Literal meaning*: "John is poor but honest."
    - *Intended meaning*: "Despite being poor, John is honest."
    - *Context/Intonation*: The use of "but" implies a contrast that the listener infers.

Understanding these expressions often relies on [[context]], shared knowledge, cultural norms, and the relationship between the speakers. The study of these aspects falls under [[pragmatics]], a subfield of [[linguistics]] that explores how language is used in communication beyond the literal meaning of words.
