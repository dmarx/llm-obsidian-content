i think the connections are more fundamental than this. during a recent recognition of Emmy Noether's birthday, a mathematician commented "kindly reminder that the isomorphism theorems are almost never attributed to Emmy Noether", to which another mathematician responded with this quote from a text:

> ...extension finita K/Q tal que ker(p) ~= Gal(QBar/K). Por el primer teorema de isomorfia de Noether: p(G_Q) ~= G_Q/ker(p) ~= Gal(Qbar/Q)/Gal(Qbar/K) ~= Gal(K/Q) .

The conversation and quote you've highlighted delve into a specific application of the isomorphism theorems within the context of field theory, a branch of algebra that deals with the properties of fields. The quote touches upon an advanced topic in algebra known as Galois theory, which studies the symmetries of algebraic equations and connects them to field extensions and their automorphism groups. The reference to Emmy Noether in this context emphasizes her foundational contributions to abstract algebra, including the development and application of the isomorphism theorems, which indeed bear her name in many areas of mathematics beyond their usual attribution.

The statement you've provided deals with an extension field $K$ of the rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$ and relates the kernel of a homomorphism $p$ to Galois groups, which are groups of field automorphisms that leave the base field invariant. In the context given:

- $\text{ker}(p)$ refers to the kernel of a homomorphism $p$, which consists of all elements that map to the identity in the target space.
- $Gal(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}/K)$ denotes the Galois group of an extension of $K$ over the algebraic closure of $\mathbb{Q}$ ($\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$), which is the group of field automorphisms of $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ that fix every element of $K$.
- The statement applies the first isomorphism theorem of Noether in the context of Galois theory, stating that if you have a group homomorphism $p$ from the Galois group of $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, denoted as $Gal(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}/\mathbb{Q})$, to another group, then the quotient of this group by the kernel of $p$ is isomorphic to the image of $p$. This is used here to relate different Galois groups and their structure.

The conversation and quote underscore the profound impact of Noether's work on modern algebra, particularly in the formulation and application of the isomorphism theorems to various areas including field theory and Galois theory. Noether's contributions laid the groundwork for understanding the structure of algebraic systems and their symmetries, far beyond the scope of what's often recognized in the basic formulation of the isomorphism theorems in group and ring theory.

This connection between Noether's theorems and Galois theory illustrates a deeper unity in mathematics, where the concepts of symmetry, structure, and invariance play crucial roles across different fields. Noether's insights into the algebraic underpinnings of symmetries have profound implications, not just in abstract algebra but also in understanding the fundamental structures underlying mathematical physics and beyond.
