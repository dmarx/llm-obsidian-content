relationship between edge contraction on a graph and tensor contraction operations


**ASSISTANT**

Edge contraction in graph theory and tensor contraction in multilinear algebra, while originating from different domains, share underlying similarities in terms of reducing complexity and simplifying structures. Below is an exploration of the relationship between these two concepts.

### Edge Contraction in Graph Theory

Edge contraction is an operation in graph theory where an edge between two vertices is removed, and the two vertices are merged into a single vertex. The new vertex inherits all edges that were incident to the original vertices, except for the contracted edge. This operation reduces the number of vertices and edges in the graph, leading to a simpler structure.

Formally, given a graph $G = (V, E)$ and an edge $e = (u, v) \in E$, contracting $e$ results in a new graph $G' = (V', E')$ where:
- $V' = V \setminus \{u, v\} \cup \{w\}$, with $w$ being the new vertex.
- $E' = E \setminus \{e\} \cup \{(w, x) : (u, x) \in E \text{ or } (v, x) \in E, x \neq u, x \neq v\}$.

### Tensor Contraction in Multilinear Algebra

Tensor contraction is an operation that reduces the order of tensors by summing over specific pairs of indices. This operation is analogous to matrix trace (which sums diagonal elements) but generalized to higher-order tensors.

Given two tensors $A \in \mathbb{R}^{I \times J \times K}$ and $B \in \mathbb{R}^{K \times L}$, a tensor contraction over the third dimension of $A$ and the first dimension of $B$ results in a new tensor $C \in \mathbb{R}^{I \times J \times L}$:
$$
C_{ijk} = \sum_{k=1}^{K} A_{ijk} B_{kl}.
$$

### Relationship and Analogy

1. **Simplification and Reduction**:
   - Both edge contraction and tensor contraction reduce the complexity of the structure they are applied to. Edge contraction simplifies the graph by reducing the number of vertices and edges, whereas tensor contraction reduces the order (rank) of the tensor by summing over specified indices.

2. **Vertex and Index Merging**:
   - In edge contraction, two vertices are merged into one, similar to how tensor contraction merges indices by summing over them. The merged vertex in a graph can be seen as analogous to a summed index in a tensor.

3. **Preservation of Structure**:
   - Edge contraction preserves the overall connectivity of the graph by retaining the incident edges (except the contracted one). Similarly, tensor contraction retains the core information by summing over indices, preserving relationships within the remaining indices.

### Example to Illustrate the Relationship

Consider a simple graph and tensor example to illustrate the analogous process.

#### Graph Example
Let $G$ be a graph with vertices $V = \{a, b, c\}$ and edges $E = \{(a, b), (b, c)\}$. Contracting the edge $(a, b)$:
- Merge vertices $a$ and $b$ into a new vertex $d$.
- The resulting graph $G'$ has vertices $V' = \{d, c\}$ and edges $E' = \{(d, c)\}$.

#### Tensor Example
Let $A \in \mathbb{R}^{2 \times 2 \times 2}$ and $B \in \mathbb{R}^{2 \times 2}$ with:
$$
A_{ijk} = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 \\
3 & 4
\end{pmatrix},
\quad
B_{kl} = \begin{pmatrix}
5 & 6 \\
7 & 8
\end{pmatrix}.
$$

Contraction over the third index of $A$ and the first index of $B$:
$$
C_{ij} = \sum_{k=1}^{2} A_{ijk} B_{kl}.
$$
For example, if we contract the third index of $A$ with the first index of $B$:
$$
C_{ij1} = A_{ij1} \cdot B_{11} + A_{ij2} \cdot B_{21}.
$$

This reduces the 3-dimensional tensor $A$ and 2-dimensional tensor $B$ into a 2-dimensional tensor $C$.

### Conclusion

The concepts of edge contraction in graphs and tensor contraction in multilinear algebra are fundamentally about reducing complexity by merging components while preserving essential structure. Edge contraction simplifies graphs by merging vertices and their incident edges, whereas tensor contraction reduces tensor rank by summing over specified indices. Both operations are crucial in their respective fields for simplifying and analyzing complex structures.
