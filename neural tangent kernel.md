The Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) is a concept that arises in the study of deep learning, particularly in analyzing the behavior of neural networks in the infinite width limit. It provides a powerful theoretical tool for understanding how neural networks train and evolve during the training process under gradient descent. The NTK is part of a broader effort within the machine learning community to connect neural network dynamics to kernel methods, offering insights into why deep learning models perform so well and how they might be improved.

### Definition and Mathematical Formalism

The Neural Tangent Kernel is defined for a neural network and describes the evolution of the network's outputs with respect to its parameters during training. More specifically, the NTK encapsulates how the outputs of a neural network change infinitesimally as its weights are updated during training. Formally, for a neural network $f(x; \theta)$ parameterized by weights $\theta$, the NTK $\Theta(x, x')$ at input points $x$ and $x'$ is defined as:

$$
\Theta(x, x') = \langle \nabla_\theta f(x; \theta), \nabla_\theta f(x'; \theta) \rangle
$$

Here, $\nabla_\theta f(x; \theta)$ denotes the gradient of the network's output with respect to its parameters $\theta$, and the inner product sums over all parameters in the network. This kernel measures the sensitivity of the output difference (for inputs $x$ and $x'$) to infinitesimal changes in the parameters.

### Connection to Training Dynamics

During training with gradient descent, the evolution of a neural network can be described by the differential equation:

$$
\frac{d}{dt} f(x; \theta(t)) = -\eta \sum_{(x', y') \in \text{training set}} \Theta(x, x') (f(x'; \theta(t)) - y')
$$

where $\eta$ is the learning rate, $(x', y')$ are training data points, and $y'$ are the corresponding labels. This formulation indicates that the training dynamics of the network are governed by the NTK, linking the kernel to how quickly and effectively a network learns.

### Infinite Width Limit and Simplification

A key result involving the NTK is that as the width of layers in certain classes of neural networks (like fully connected or convolutional networks) tends toward infinity, the NTK converges to a deterministic limit and remains constant during training. This means that in this limit, training a neural network is equivalent to kernel regression with this fixed kernel, which simplifies the analysis of learning dynamics significantly. It also explains why larger networks tend to be easier to train and generalize better: they approximate the behavior of a linear model in the space induced by the NTK.

### Implications and Applications

- **Understanding Deep Learning**: The NTK provides a theoretical framework to analyze and predict the behavior of neural networks, particularly their training dynamics and generalization capabilities.
- **Architecture Design**: Insights from the NTK can guide the design of neural network architectures that are more amenable to efficient training.
- **Bridging Theory and Practice**: By connecting the behavior of practical neural networks with theoretical models, the NTK helps in developing more principled approaches to training and deploying neural networks.

In summary, the Neural Tangent Kernel offers a compelling view of how deep learning models evolve under training, providing a bridge between the intuitive geometrical interpretation of kernel methods and the complex dynamics of deep neural networks. This connection not only enhances our theoretical understanding of neural network behavior but also offers practical insights that can lead to better model design and training techniques.

# Neural Tangent Kernel

The [[Neural Tangent Kernel]] (NTK) is a theoretical framework that connects deep neural networks to kernel methods, providing insights into the learning dynamics and convergence properties of neural networks in the infinite-width limit.

## Mathematical Formulation

Consider a neural network f(x,θ) where:
- x is the input
- θ represents the network parameters
- f: ℝᵈ × ℝᵖ → ℝ is the network function

The NTK is defined as:

Θ(x,x') = ⟨∇_θf(x,θ), ∇_θf(x',θ)⟩

where ∇_θf represents the gradient of f with respect to parameters θ.

### Infinite-Width Limit

In the limit as the width of hidden layers approaches infinity, under appropriate initialization and scaling:

1. The kernel converges to a deterministic limit: Θ(x,x') → Θ_∞(x,x')
2. The kernel remains approximately constant during training: Θ_t ≈ Θ_0

## Training Dynamics

Under gradient descent with learning rate η, the evolution of network outputs f(x,θ_t) follows:

∂_t f(x,θ_t) = -η∑ᵢ Θ_t(x,xᵢ)(f(xᵢ,θ_t) - yᵢ)

In the infinite-width limit, this becomes a linear system:

∂_t u_t = -ηΘ_∞(u_t - y)

where:
- u_t represents the vector of network outputs
- y represents the target values
- Θ_∞ is the limiting kernel matrix

## Explicit Forms for Common Architectures

### Fully Connected Networks

For a two-layer network with activation function σ:

Θ_∞(x,x') = σ'(⟨x,x'⟩/√d)²⟨x,x'⟩

where d is the input dimension.

### Deep Networks

For L-layer networks, the NTK can be computed recursively:

Θ^(l+1)(x,x') = Θ^(l)(x,x')σ'(h^(l)(x))σ'(h^(l)(x'))

where h^(l) represents the pre-activation at layer l.

## Theoretical Implications

### Convergence Properties

1. [[Global Convergence]]: In the infinite-width limit, gradient descent converges to global minima for squared loss.

2. [[Exponential Convergence]]: The training error decreases exponentially:
   ||u_t - y||² ∝ exp(-ηλ_min(Θ_∞)t)

where λ_min denotes the minimum eigenvalue.

### Feature Learning

The NTK provides insights into how neural networks learn features:

1. [[Spectral Bias]]: Networks learn functions along eigendirections of Θ_∞ in order of decreasing eigenvalue.

2. [[Kernel Evolution]]: Finite-width networks exhibit kernel evolution during training, potentially explaining their superior performance over static kernels.

## Practical Applications

### Architecture Design
Understanding the NTK structure helps in:
- Choosing activation functions
- Determining layer widths
- Selecting initialization schemes

### Optimization
The NTK perspective informs:
- Learning rate selection
- Preconditioning methods
- Convergence analysis

## Extensions and Variants

### Neural Network Gaussian Process (NNGP)
The [[Neural Network Gaussian Process]] describes the distribution of network outputs in the infinite-width limit:

K(x,x') = E[f(x,θ)f(x',θ)]

### Conjugate Kernel
The [[Conjugate Kernel]] combines the NTK and NNGP:

Κ(x,x') = Θ(x,x') + K(x,x')
