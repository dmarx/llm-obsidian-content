title: research knowledge graph with benchmark verification
---

**USER**

in our motivating use case, evidence often takes the form of a measurement with respect to a benchmark. it would be useful if our knowledge graph were structured such that if an issue were discovered with some benchmark, we could propagate that through our graph to deprecate evidence that is unreliable because it uses an unreliable benchmark or some such

# Research Knowledge Graph with Benchmark Verification

## Graph Structure
```
G = (V, E, P) where:

V = {
  claims: Claim,
  evidence: Evidence,
  benchmarks: Benchmark,
  metrics: Metric,
  measurements: Measurement
}

E = {
  measured_on: (Evidence, Benchmark),
  validated_by: (Benchmark, ValidationStudy),
  uses_metric: (Measurement, Metric)
}

P = {  // Propagation rules
  benchmark_reliability: Benchmark → [0,1],
  evidence_validity: Evidence → [0,1]
}
```

## Example
```
Benchmark: {
  name: "ImageNet",
  version: "ILSVRC2012",
  reliability: 0.95,
  known_issues: ["Label noise: 6%"],
  validation_studies: ["Stock2018", "Northcutt2021"]
}

Evidence: {
  claim: "ViT outperforms ResNet",
  measurement: {
    value: "+1.4%",
    metric: "Top-1 Accuracy",
    benchmark: "ImageNet",
    validity: benchmark.reliability * measurement.statistical_power
  }
}
```

## Propagation Rules
```python
def update_evidence_validity(benchmark):
    affected = MATCH (e:Evidence)-[:measured_on]->(b:Benchmark)
                WHERE b.id = benchmark.id
    
    for evidence in affected:
        evidence.validity *= benchmark.reliability
        
    return affected
```
