McDonald-Kreitman test


**ASSISTANT**

The **McDonald-Kreitman (MK) test** is a statistical test used in molecular evolution to detect natural selection at the level of DNA sequences. It compares the ratio of nonsynonymous (amino-acid altering) to synonymous (silent) substitutions within a species (polymorphism) and between species (divergence). The premise of the test is that if a gene is evolving neutrally, the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous changes should be the same within and between species. If the ratios differ, it indicates that selection is acting on the gene.

The MK test was first introduced by [[John McDonald]] and [[Martin Kreitman]] in 1991 and has since become a widely used tool to test for deviations from neutrality, especially for detecting **positive selection** or **adaptive evolution**.

### How the McDonald-Kreitman Test Works

The MK test divides sequence changes into four categories:
1. **Polymorphic Synonymous** sites (PS): Synonymous changes that vary within a species.
2. **Polymorphic Nonsynonymous** sites (PN): Nonsynonymous changes that vary within a species.
3. **Fixed Synonymous** sites (FS): Synonymous changes that have become fixed between two species.
4. **Fixed Nonsynonymous** sites (FN): Nonsynonymous changes that have become fixed between two species.

The test is based on the following **2x2 contingency table**:

|                | Synonymous (silent) changes | Nonsynonymous (amino-acid altering) changes |
|----------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Polymorphisms (within species)** | PS                              | PN                                          |
| **Fixed differences (between species)** | FS                              | FN                                          |

Under **neutral evolution**, the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous polymorphisms within a species (PN/PS) should be equal to the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous fixed differences between species (FN/FS). That is:
$$
\frac{\text{PN}}{\text{PS}} \approx \frac{\text{FN}}{\text{FS}}
$$

Any significant deviation from this ratio implies a departure from neutrality, and this can signal either **positive selection** or **purifying selection**.

### Interpreting the Results

1. **Positive Selection**: If the ratio of fixed nonsynonymous substitutions (FN) to fixed synonymous substitutions (FS) is significantly higher than the ratio of polymorphic nonsynonymous substitutions (PN) to polymorphic synonymous substitutions (PS), it suggests **adaptive evolution**. This implies that some nonsynonymous mutations have been beneficial and fixed due to positive selection.
   $$ \frac{\text{FN}}{\text{FS}} > \frac{\text{PN}}{\text{PS}} $$
   Example: Genes involved in immune response, which frequently evolve under positive selection to counteract evolving pathogens, often show a significant excess of nonsynonymous divergence (FN > PN).

2. **Purifying Selection**: If the ratio of nonsynonymous polymorphisms (PN) to synonymous polymorphisms (PS) is higher than the ratio of nonsynonymous fixed differences (FN) to synonymous fixed differences (FS), it suggests **purifying (negative) selection**. This implies that most nonsynonymous mutations are deleterious and are removed by selection before they can become fixed.
   $$ \frac{\text{PN}}{\text{PS}} > \frac{\text{FN}}{\text{FS}} $$
   Example: Structural genes, such as those coding for enzymes, often undergo strong purifying selection to maintain functional protein structures, resulting in very few nonsynonymous fixations.

3. **Neutral Evolution**: If the ratios PN/PS and FN/FS are roughly equal, it suggests that the gene is evolving neutrally, without strong selection for or against nonsynonymous changes.

### Mathematical Formalism

The MK test typically uses a **chi-squared test** or a **Fisher’s exact test** to compare the observed counts in the 2x2 contingency table of synonymous and nonsynonymous changes.

- **Chi-Squared Test**: The chi-squared statistic \( \chi^2 \) is calculated from the 2x2 contingency table:
   $$
   \chi^2 = \sum \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}
   $$
   where \( O_i \) is the observed count in each category, and \( E_i \) is the expected count under the null hypothesis of neutrality (i.e., that the ratios of synonymous and nonsynonymous changes are the same within and between species).

- **Fisher’s Exact Test**: When sample sizes are small or when one or more of the expected counts in the contingency table are small, the **Fisher’s exact test** is preferred over the chi-squared test because it provides an exact p-value.

### McDonald-Kreitman Test in Practice

1. **Drosophila Example (McDonald and Kreitman, 1991)**: The original application of the MK test was on the *Adh* gene in *Drosophila melanogaster*. McDonald and Kreitman observed that the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous changes was significantly higher between species than within species, providing evidence for positive selection driving divergence in the *Adh* gene.

2. **Applications in Human Evolution**: The MK test has been widely used to identify positively selected genes in humans. For example, genes involved in immune defense, reproduction, and sensory perception have shown signatures of adaptive evolution when analyzed using the MK test.

3. **Genome-wide Studies**: The MK test can be applied to large datasets, comparing thousands of genes to detect signals of selection across the genome. Modern computational tools allow for automated implementation of the MK test on whole-genome data, making it a powerful method in evolutionary genomics.

### Limitations and Extensions

While powerful, the MK test does have limitations:
1. **Demography**: The test assumes that observed polymorphism within a species is not heavily influenced by demographic factors like population bottlenecks, expansions, or gene flow. However, demographic events can skew the ratios of polymorphism and divergence, leading to false positives or negatives in detecting selection.

2. **Selection on Linked Sites**: The MK test can be affected by **genetic hitchhiking** or **background selection**. These processes can reduce the level of polymorphism in a region of the genome without direct selection on the gene in question, confounding the results of the test.

3. **Nearly Neutral Mutations**: The MK test assumes a sharp distinction between neutral and selected mutations. However, many mutations may be **nearly neutral**, especially in large populations where even small selection coefficients can affect allele frequencies. This complicates interpretation in cases where the boundaries between neutrality and selection are blurred.

### Extensions to the MK Test
Several extensions of the MK test have been developed to address its limitations:
- **Direction of Selection (DoS)**: This statistic is calculated as:
   $$
   \text{DoS} = \frac{\text{FN}}{\text{FN} + \text{FS}} - \frac{\text{PN}}{\text{PN} + \text{PS}}
   $$
   A positive DoS value suggests positive selection, while a negative value suggests purifying selection. This metric incorporates both polymorphism and divergence in a way that allows for easier interpretation of selection intensity.

- **DGRP-MK**: This extension integrates population data from large-scale sequencing efforts, such as the **Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP)**, to provide higher statistical power and better resolution in detecting selection across the genome.

- **Bayesian Approaches**: Bayesian models for the MK test have been developed to account for uncertainty in the underlying parameters, such as mutation rates and the demographic history of populations.

### Conclusion

The **McDonald-Kreitman test** remains one of the most widely used tools for detecting natural selection at the molecular level. By comparing the ratios of nonsynonymous to synonymous changes within and between species, the test provides a powerful means of distinguishing neutral evolution from selective processes like positive or purifying selection. Despite its limitations, it is a central method in evolutionary genomics and forms the basis for many advanced techniques aimed at understanding the forces that shape genetic diversity.
