title: exceptional points

exceptional points


**ASSISTANT**

Exceptional points (EPs) are degeneracies in the parameter space of non-Hermitian systems where two or more eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors coalesce. Unlike Hermitian systems, where degeneracies typically involve only the eigenvalues, EPs involve both eigenvalues and eigenvectors merging, leading to unique and intriguing physical phenomena.

### Mathematical Formalism

Consider a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian $H(\lambda)$ depending on a complex parameter $\lambda$. The eigenvalue equation is:
$$
H(\lambda) \psi_i(\lambda) = E_i(\lambda) \psi_i(\lambda)
$$
At an exceptional point $\lambda = \lambda_{EP}$, two (or more) eigenvalues $E_i(\lambda)$ and $E_j(\lambda)$ and their corresponding eigenvectors $\psi_i(\lambda)$ and $\psi_j(\lambda)$ coalesce:
$$
E_i(\lambda_{EP}) = E_j(\lambda_{EP}) \quad \text{and} \quad \psi_i(\lambda_{EP}) = \psi_j(\lambda_{EP})
$$

To illustrate this, consider a $2 \times 2$ non-Hermitian Hamiltonian:
$$
H(\lambda) = \begin{pmatrix}
  a(\lambda) & b(\lambda) \\
  c(\lambda) & d(\lambda)
\end{pmatrix}
$$
The eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation:
$$
\det(H - E I) = 0 \implies (a(\lambda) - E)(d(\lambda) - E) - b(\lambda)c(\lambda) = 0
$$
This quadratic equation gives:
$$
E = \frac{a(\lambda) + d(\lambda) \pm \sqrt{(a(\lambda) - d(\lambda))^2 + 4b(\lambda)c(\lambda)}}{2}
$$
At the exceptional point, the discriminant of the quadratic equation vanishes:
$$
(a(\lambda_{EP}) - d(\lambda_{EP}))^2 + 4b(\lambda_{EP})c(\lambda_{EP}) = 0
$$
This results in both eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors coalescing.

### Physical Consequences

1. **Eigenvalue Sensitivity**:
   Near EPs, the eigenvalues of the system exhibit an enhanced sensitivity to perturbations. Small changes in system parameters can lead to large changes in the eigenvalues, making EPs useful for designing sensors with high sensitivity.

2. **Non-Orthogonal Modes**:
   At EPs, the eigenvectors become linearly dependent, leading to non-orthogonal modes. This can cause unusual interference effects and has implications for wave dynamics in optical and acoustic systems.

3. **Non-Hermitian Skin Effect**:
   EPs are associated with the non-Hermitian skin effect, where bulk states localize at the boundaries of a system. This leads to an asymmetric distribution of modes, which can be harnessed for directional transport of energy or particles.

4. **Topological Phenomena**:
   Non-Hermitian systems with EPs can exhibit unique topological properties. For instance, the winding number around an EP in the complex eigenvalue plane can be related to topological invariants, leading to robust edge states and protected transport phenomena.

### Example: Two-Level System

Consider a simple two-level non-Hermitian system described by the Hamiltonian:
$$
H = \begin{pmatrix}
  0 & 1 \\
  1 & i\gamma
\end{pmatrix}
$$
where $\gamma$ is a real parameter. The eigenvalues are:
$$
E = \frac{i\gamma \pm \sqrt{-\gamma^2 - 4}}{2}
$$
The system exhibits an exceptional point at $\gamma = \pm 2i$, where the eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce:
$$
E_{EP} = \pm i, \quad \psi_{EP} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ \mp i \end{pmatrix}
$$

### Conclusion

Exceptional points in non-Hermitian systems introduce novel features that have no counterpart in Hermitian physics. They lead to enhanced sensitivity, non-orthogonal eigenmodes, and unique topological properties. Understanding and exploiting EPs can open up new avenues in various fields, including optics, quantum mechanics, and materials science, providing tools for developing advanced sensors, robust communication channels, and devices with unprecedented functionalities.
