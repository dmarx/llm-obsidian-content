### Pressure Ridges

**Pressure ridges** are prominent features in sea ice and lake ice that form due to the compression and subsequent buckling or fracturing of the ice. These ridges are created when large ice floes or sheets are forced together by wind, currents, or thermal expansion, causing the ice to deform both above and below the surface. Pressure ridges are significant in the study of ice dynamics, influencing everything from ice thickness distribution to navigation and offshore operations in polar regions.

### Formation of Pressure Ridges

1. **Ice Compression**:
   - **Forces Driving Compression**: Pressure ridges form primarily due to horizontal compressive forces acting on the ice. These forces can be generated by wind pushing ice floes together, ocean currents moving ice against coastlines or other ice features, or thermal expansion as temperatures fluctuate.
   - **Initial Fracturing**: As ice floes are forced together, the stress exceeds the ice's tensile strength, leading to fracturing. These fractures create cracks or leads in the ice, where the individual floes begin to collide and overlap.

2. **Buckling and Overlapping**:
   - **Keels and Sails**: The collision of ice floes causes the ice to buckle and deform, creating a ridge. The ridge consists of an above-water portion, called the sail, and a submerged portion, known as the keel. The sail can rise several meters above the ice surface, while the keel can extend even deeper below the waterline, sometimes up to five times the height of the sail.
   - **Accumulation of Ice Blocks**: The buckling process involves the accumulation of broken and fragmented ice blocks, which pile up on top of one another to form the ridge. These blocks can become tightly packed, especially in the keel, where the ice is subjected to further compression.

### Characteristics of Pressure Ridges

1. **Structure**:
   - **Sail and Keel**: The most distinguishing feature of a pressure ridge is its sail and keel structure. The sail, composed of ice blocks piled above the surface, is easily visible and can reach several meters in height. The keel, which is below the surface, is usually much thicker and extends deeper into the water, contributing significantly to the overall mass of the ridge.
   - **Internal Structure**: Inside a pressure ridge, the ice is typically highly deformed and fragmented. The internal structure consists of a mix of tightly packed ice blocks, often with voids filled with seawater or snow. The ice within the ridge is less saline than surrounding sea ice due to the brine drainage that occurs during the formation process.

2. **Size and Distribution**:
   - **Size Variation**: Pressure ridges can vary greatly in size, from small ridges a few meters long and less than a meter high to large, continuous ridges that stretch for kilometers and reach heights of 10 meters or more.
   - **Location**: Pressure ridges commonly form in regions with significant ice drift, such as the central Arctic, near coastlines, and along the boundaries of large ice floes. They are also frequently found near leads, polynyas, and other areas where ice floes interact dynamically.

3. **Seasonal Evolution**:
   - **Winter Formation and Growth**: Pressure ridges primarily form during the winter months when the ice is thick and conditions are cold, facilitating the compression and deformation of ice floes. During this period, ridges can grow significantly as ice continues to be pushed together.
   - **Summer Melting**: In summer, the exposed sail of a pressure ridge is subject to melting from the sun and atmospheric warming, while the keel may also melt due to contact with warmer seawater. However, because of their thickness, pressure ridges often persist through the melt season, contributing to the survival of multi-year ice.

### Impact on the Environment and Human Activities

1. **Ice Thickness Distribution**:
   - **Increased Ice Thickness**: Pressure ridges contribute to the overall thickness distribution of sea ice. The thick keels of pressure ridges are significant because they add considerable mass to the ice cover, making it more resistant to melting during the summer months.
   - **Role in Multi-Year Ice**: Pressure ridges are often integral to the formation and maintenance of multi-year ice, as the thick ice they create can survive through multiple melt seasons, even when surrounding ice melts away.

2. **Navigation and Offshore Operations**:
   - **Hazards to Navigation**: Pressure ridges pose significant hazards to ships, particularly icebreakers and vessels operating in polar regions. The thick keels of pressure ridges can extend far below the surface, making them dangerous obstacles that can damage hulls or become stuck under vessels.
   - **Challenges for Offshore Infrastructure**: For offshore oil and gas operations, pressure ridges present a major engineering challenge. The force exerted by pressure ridges can damage underwater pipelines, drilling rigs, and other infrastructure. Consequently, these structures must be designed to withstand the impact of ice ridges or be strategically placed to avoid areas prone to ridge formation.

3. **Impact on Ecosystems**:
   - **Habitat for Marine Life**: Pressure ridges can create unique microhabitats in the Arctic marine environment. The voids and spaces within the ridge provide shelter for small organisms, while the thick ice can serve as a platform for larger animals such as seals.
   - **Influence on Primary Production**: Pressure ridges can influence the distribution of light and nutrients in the water column, affecting primary production under the ice. The melting of pressure ridges during the summer can release fresh water and nutrients, which can enhance biological productivity in the surrounding area.

### Observation and Study

1. **Field Observations**:
   - **Ice Profiling**: Field studies often involve ice profiling to measure the height and depth of pressure ridges. This can be done using ice augers, coring tools, and underwater sonar to assess the size of the keel and the overall thickness of the ridge.
   - **Remote Measurement**: Remote methods, such as ice-penetrating radar and laser altimetry, are also used to measure the surface and subsurface structure of pressure ridges, providing a detailed understanding of their dimensions and distribution.

2. **Remote Sensing**:
   - **Satellite Imaging**: Pressure ridges can be detected using satellite imagery, particularly synthetic aperture radar (SAR), which is effective in identifying rough ice surfaces and features like ridges. SAR can provide continuous monitoring of pressure ridge formation and movement over large areas.
   - **Aerial Surveys**: Aerial surveys using radar, lidar, and photogrammetry offer high-resolution data on pressure ridges, including precise measurements of ridge height, surface roughness, and ice thickness.

3. **Modeling and Simulation**:
   - **Ice Dynamics Models**: Numerical models of sea ice dynamics incorporate pressure ridge formation as a critical process. These models simulate the forces acting on ice floes, the formation of ridges, and their impact on the overall ice cover. Modeling pressure ridges is important for predicting ice thickness distribution and assessing the risks to navigation and offshore operations.
   - **Climate Models**: Pressure ridges are also included in climate models as part of the sea ice component. Their formation, evolution, and role in maintaining multi-year ice are important factors in understanding how sea ice will respond to changing climate conditions.

### Conclusion

**Pressure ridges** are essential features in the dynamics of sea ice, formed by the compression and deformation of ice floes under horizontal stress. These ridges play a significant role in increasing the overall thickness and stability of sea ice, making them important in the context of climate change and polar navigation. However, they also present challenges to marine navigation and offshore operations due to their size and the hazards they pose. Understanding the formation, structure, and impact of pressure ridges is crucial for predicting changes in the polar regions and for the safe operation of vessels and infrastructure in icy waters. Through field studies, remote sensing, and numerical modeling, researchers continue to advance our knowledge of pressure ridges and their implications for the Arctic and Antarctic environments.
