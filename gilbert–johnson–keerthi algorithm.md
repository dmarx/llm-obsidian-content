Gilbert–Johnson–Keerthi algorithm


**ASSISTANT**

The Gilbert–Johnson–Keerthi (GJK) algorithm is a [[computational geometry]] algorithm used for solving the problem of collision detection and distance computation between convex shapes. It is widely used in computer graphics, robotics, and physics simulations due to its efficiency and robustness. Here's an in-depth look at the algorithm:

## Overview

### Problem Statement
The GJK algorithm addresses two primary problems:
1. **Collision Detection**: Determine whether two convex shapes intersect.
2. **Distance Computation**: Compute the minimum distance between two convex shapes when they do not intersect.

### Key Concepts
- **Convex Shape**: A shape is convex if, for any two points within the shape, the line segment connecting them lies entirely within the shape.
- **Minkowski Difference**: Given two sets $A$ and $B$, their Minkowski difference is defined as:
  $$ A \ominus B = \{ a - b \mid a \in A, b \in B \} $$
  If the origin (0,0,0) lies within the Minkowski difference, then the two shapes intersect.

### Simplex
A simplex is a generalization of a triangle or tetrahedron to arbitrary dimensions:
- **0-simplex**: A point.
- **1-simplex**: A line segment.
- **2-simplex**: A triangle.
- **3-simplex**: A tetrahedron.

## Algorithm

### Initialization
1. **Support Function**: The support function finds the point in a shape that is farthest in a given direction. For a shape $A$ and a direction $\mathbf{d}$, it is defined as:
   $$ \text{support}(A, \mathbf{d}) = \arg\max_{a \in A} (\mathbf{d} \cdot a) $$
2. **Initial Simplex**: Start with an arbitrary direction $\mathbf{d}$ and compute the support points for both shapes $A$ and $B$. The initial point in the simplex is:
   $$ \mathbf{p}_0 = \text{support}(A, \mathbf{d}) - \text{support}(B, -\mathbf{d}) $$

### Iterative Process
1. **Direction Update**: Calculate a new search direction $\mathbf{d}$, usually towards the origin.
2. **New Support Point**: Compute a new point in the Minkowski difference along $\mathbf{d}$:
   $$ \mathbf{p}_i = \text{support}(A, \mathbf{d}) - \text{support}(B, -\mathbf{d}) $$
3. **Simplex Update**: Add the new point to the simplex and update the simplex to move closer to the origin.
4. **Termination Conditions**:
   - If the origin is within the simplex, the shapes intersect.
   - If the new point does not move the simplex closer to the origin, the shapes do not intersect, and the distance can be computed.

### Simplex Management
The GJK algorithm maintains and updates the simplex using specific rules:
- **Line Segment**: If the simplex is a line segment, update direction $\mathbf{d}$ towards the closest point on the segment to the origin.
- **Triangle**: If the simplex is a triangle, check if the origin is inside the triangle. If not, update $\mathbf{d}$ to the closest edge.
- **Tetrahedron**: If the simplex is a tetrahedron, check if the origin is inside the tetrahedron. If not, update $\mathbf{d}$ to the closest face.

### Termination
The algorithm terminates when one of the following conditions is met:
- **Intersection**: The origin is inside the simplex.
- **No Intersection**: The simplex cannot be expanded further towards the origin, indicating no intersection, and the closest point on the simplex to the origin gives the distance between the shapes.

## Mathematical Formulation
The GJK algorithm is based on the properties of the Minkowski difference and convex sets. The key mathematical operations involve finding support points, updating simplices, and checking geometric conditions. These operations ensure that the algorithm efficiently converges to the correct result.

## Applications
The GJK algorithm is particularly useful in:
- **Physics Engines**: For real-time collision detection and response in simulations.
- **Robotics**: For path planning and obstacle avoidance.
- **Computer Graphics**: For rendering scenes with complex interactions between objects.

### Example
Consider two convex polygons in 2D space. The GJK algorithm can determine if they intersect by iteratively building and updating a simplex (a line segment or triangle) until the origin is either found inside the simplex or determined to be outside all possible simplices.
