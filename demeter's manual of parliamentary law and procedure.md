### Demeter's Manual of Parliamentary Law and Procedure

**Demeter's Manual of Parliamentary Law and Procedure** (often referred to as "Demeter's") is a comprehensive guide to [[parliamentary procedure]], widely used in various types of deliberative assemblies. Authored by George Demeter, the manual is known for its detailed explanations, practical examples, and thorough coverage of parliamentary law.

#### Core Principles

1. **Democratic Process**: Ensures that meetings are conducted in a manner that allows for democratic decision-making.
2. **Orderly Conduct**: Maintains order during meetings to facilitate productive discussions and decision-making.
3. **Fair Representation**: Protects the rights of all members, ensuring that both majority and minority opinions are considered.

#### Key Concepts

1. **Motions**: Formal proposals for consideration and decision. Demeter's categorizes motions into several types:
   - **Main Motions**: Introduce new business or propose decisions.
   - **Subsidiary Motions**: Modify or dispose of main motions (e.g., amend, commit, postpone).
   - **Privileged Motions**: Address urgent matters unrelated to the current business (e.g., adjourn, recess).
   - **Incidental Motions**: Raise procedural questions (e.g., point of order, division of the assembly).
   - **Restorative Motions**: Reconsider or renew decisions (e.g., reconsider, rescind).

2. **Debate**: Structured discussion on motions, with rules to ensure fairness and order:
   - **Recognition**: Members must be recognized by the chair before speaking.
   - **Limits on Debate**: Time and frequency limits on speeches to ensure efficient proceedings.

3. **Voting**: Methods for accurately reflecting members' decisions:
   - **Voice Vote**: Members express their vote aloud.
   - **Roll Call Vote**: Votes are recorded individually.
   - **Secret Ballot**: Votes are cast anonymously.
   - **Division of the Assembly**: A rising vote to verify a voice vote.

4. **Quorum**: The minimum number of members required to be present to conduct business, usually defined by the organizationâ€™s bylaws.

#### Meeting Structure

1. **Call to Order**: The meeting begins with a formal call to order by the presiding officer.
2. **Approval of Minutes**: Review and approval of the minutes from the previous meeting.
3. **Reports**: Presentation of reports from officers, boards, and standing committees.
4. **Unfinished Business**: Addressing any business carried over from previous meetings.
5. **New Business**: Introduction and discussion of new topics.
6. **Adjournment**: Formal conclusion of the meeting.

#### Unique Features

1. **Detailed Explanations**: Demeter's provides in-depth explanations and examples for various procedures, making it useful for complex and formal settings.
2. **Extensive Coverage**: Covers a wide range of parliamentary procedures and potential scenarios in detail.
3. **Flexibility and Adaptability**: Offers guidelines for adapting procedures to different types of organizations and assemblies.

#### Differences from Other Manuals

1. **Comprehensive Detail**: Compared to [[Robert's Rules of Order|Robert's Rules]] and [[Sturgis' Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure|Sturgis]], Demeter's is more detailed and thorough, making it suitable for larger and more complex assemblies.
2. **Practical Examples**: Includes numerous examples to illustrate procedures, aiding in practical application.

#### Practical Application

Demeter's Manual is used by a variety of organizations, including:

- Legislative bodies
- Professional associations
- Large nonprofit organizations
- Academic institutions

The use of Demeter's ensures that meetings are conducted with a high level of formality and precision, suitable for settings where detailed procedural knowledge is essential.
