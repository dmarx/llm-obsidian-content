Riemann problem at a cell interface

### The Riemann Problem at a Cell Interface

The **Riemann problem** is a fundamental concept in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and numerical methods for hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs). It refers to a special initial value problem where the initial data consists of two constant states separated by a discontinuity. This problem is particularly important when dealing with **conservation laws**, such as those found in fluid dynamics (e.g., the Euler equations).

When solving hyperbolic PDEs using methods like Godunov’s method or other finite volume methods, the Riemann problem arises naturally at the interfaces between computational cells. The solution of the Riemann problem at these interfaces is used to compute the fluxes of conserved quantities, which are then used to update the state variables within each cell.

### Definition and Setup

The **Riemann problem** is defined for a conservation law in one dimension:

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial f(u)}{\partial x} = 0,
$$

where:
- \( u(x,t) \) is the conserved quantity (e.g., density, momentum).
- \( f(u) \) is the flux function, which depends on the conserved quantity \( u \).

The initial condition for the Riemann problem is a piecewise constant function with a discontinuity at \( x = 0 \):

$$
u(x,0) = 
\begin{cases}
u_L, & \text{if } x < 0, \\
u_R, & \text{if } x > 0,
\end{cases}
$$

where \( u_L \) and \( u_R \) are the left and right states, respectively.

### Importance in Numerical Methods

In numerical schemes like Godunov's method, the computational domain is divided into discrete cells, and the Riemann problem is solved at each cell interface (i.e., the boundaries between adjacent cells). The solution to this problem determines the fluxes across the interface, which are crucial for updating the conserved quantities in each cell.

### Solution of the Riemann Problem

The solution to the Riemann problem typically involves the following key elements:

1. **Wave Structures**:
   - **Shock Waves**: Discontinuities that move at a speed determined by the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions, which conserve mass, momentum, and energy across the shock.
   - **Rarefaction Waves**: Continuous, smooth solutions where characteristics spread out from the initial discontinuity, leading to a fan-like structure.
   - **Contact Discontinuities**: Discontinuities where the pressure and normal velocity are continuous, but other quantities like density may be discontinuous.

2. **Riemann Invariants**:
   - These are quantities that remain constant along the characteristics of the PDE. They are particularly useful in solving the Riemann problem analytically or numerically.

3. **Exact vs. Approximate Solvers**:
   - **Exact Riemann Solver**: Computes the precise solution to the Riemann problem by resolving the structure of shock and [[rarefaction waves]]. This approach can be computationally expensive, especially for complex systems like the Euler equations.
   - **Approximate Riemann Solvers**: These solvers simplify the problem to reduce computational cost. Common approximate solvers include the **Roe Solver**, **HLL (Harten, Lax, van Leer) Solver**, and **HLLC (Harten, Lax, van Leer, Contact) Solver**. These methods approximate the wave structure while capturing essential features like shock and [[contact discontinuities]].

### Example: Riemann Problem for the Euler Equations

Consider the one-dimensional Euler equations, which govern the flow of an ideal compressible fluid:

1. **Conservation of Mass**:
   $$
   \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial (\rho u)}{\partial x} = 0,
   $$

2. **Conservation of Momentum**:
   $$
   \frac{\partial (\rho u)}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial (\rho u^2 + p)}{\partial x} = 0,
   $$

3. **Conservation of Energy**:
   $$
   \frac{\partial E}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial [(E + p) u]}{\partial x} = 0,
   $$

where \( \rho \) is the density, \( u \) is the velocity, \( p \) is the pressure, and \( E \) is the total energy.

### Steps to Solve the Riemann Problem at a Cell Interface:

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - At the interface between two computational cells, define the left state \( u_L = (\rho_L, u_L, p_L) \) and the right state \( u_R = (\rho_R, u_R, p_R) \).

2. **Determine Wave Speeds**:
   - Identify the wave speeds \( s_L \) and \( s_R \) that bound the region of influence of the initial discontinuity. These could be the speeds of [[shock waves]], [[rarefaction waves]], or [[contact discontinuities]].

3. **Compute Fluxes**:
   - Using the wave speeds and the structure of the solution (e.g., whether the waves are shocks or rarefactions), compute the fluxes \( F_{L} \) and \( F_{R} \) at the interface.

4. **Update Cell Values**:
   - The computed flux is used to update the conserved quantities in the neighboring cells. The update step typically looks like:
     $$
     u_i^{n+1} = u_i^n - \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x} \left[ F_{i+\frac{1}{2}}^n - F_{i-\frac{1}{2}}^n \right],
     $$
     where \( F_{i+\frac{1}{2}}^n \) is the flux at the right boundary of cell \( i \).

### Approximate Riemann Solvers

Given the complexity of the exact solution, approximate solvers are often employed:

1. **Roe Solver**:
   - Linearizes the system about an average state, allowing the calculation of wave speeds and fluxes with reduced computational cost.

2. **HLL Solver**:
   - Simplifies the solution by considering only the fastest left- and right-moving waves, ignoring intermediate waves.

3. **HLLC Solver**:
   - Extends the HLL solver by including a contact wave, improving the accuracy for capturing [[contact discontinuities]].

4. **Godunov’s Method**:
   - In Godunov's method, the Riemann problem is solved at each cell interface, and the resulting flux is used to update the state variables in each cell. This method is particularly effective for problems with strong shocks and discontinuities.

### Conclusion

The **Riemann problem at a cell interface** is a crucial concept in numerical methods for hyperbolic PDEs, especially in CFD. It provides the framework for calculating fluxes across cell boundaries, which are essential for updating the solution in finite volume and finite difference methods. Whether solved exactly or approximately, the Riemann problem ensures that important features of the solution, such as shocks and [[contact discontinuities]], are accurately captured, leading to stable and physically realistic simulations.
