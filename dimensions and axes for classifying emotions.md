## Dimensions and Axes for Classifying Emotions

Emotions can be classified and structured along various dimensions and axes, each capturing different aspects of emotional experience. These classifications help in understanding, analyzing, and measuring emotions systematically. Here are some key dimensions and axes commonly used in emotion ontologies:

### 1. **Valence (Pleasure-Displeasure)**
   - **Definition**: Refers to the intrinsic attractiveness (positive valence) or averseness (negative valence) of an emotional experience.
   - **Examples**:
     - Positive Valence: Happiness, joy, love.
     - Negative Valence: Sadness, anger, fear.

### 2. **Arousal (Activation)**
   - **Definition**: Measures the intensity of the emotional experience, ranging from calm/low arousal to excited/high arousal.
   - **Examples**:
     - High Arousal: Excitement, anxiety.
     - Low Arousal: Relaxation, boredom.

### 3. **Dominance (Control)**
   - **Definition**: Describes the degree of control or dominance an individual feels over a situation or their emotional state.
   - **Examples**:
     - High Dominance: Empowerment, pride.
     - Low Dominance: Helplessness, submission.

### 4. **Duration**
   - **Definition**: The length of time an emotion is experienced.
   - **Examples**:
     - Short-Term: Surprise, shock.
     - Long-Term: Depression, contentment.

### 5. **Complexity**
   - **Definition**: The extent to which an emotion is a combination of multiple basic emotions or a singular, straightforward emotion.
   - **Examples**:
     - Simple: Joy, anger.
     - Complex: Love, guilt.

### 6. **Intensity**
   - **Definition**: The strength or magnitude of the emotional experience.
   - **Examples**:
     - Low Intensity: Mild amusement, slight irritation.
     - High Intensity: Ecstatic joy, intense rage.

### 7. **Focus (Self-Other)**
   - **Definition**: Indicates whether the emotion is self-focused or other-focused.
   - **Examples**:
     - Self-Focused: Shame, pride.
     - Other-Focused: Empathy, jealousy.

### 8. **Functionality (Adaptive-Maladaptive)**
   - **Definition**: The extent to which an emotion serves an adaptive function or hinders well-being and effective functioning.
   - **Examples**:
     - Adaptive: Fear (as a response to danger), happiness.
     - Maladaptive: Chronic anxiety, despair.

### 9. **Social versus Nonsocial Emotions**
   - **Definition**: Differentiates emotions that arise from social interactions versus those that do not.
   - **Examples**:
     - Social: Embarrassment, guilt.
     - Nonsocial: Awe, nostalgia.

### Theoretical Models for Classifying Emotions

1. **Circumplex Model of Affect (Russell, 1980)**
   - **Axes**: Valence and Arousal.
   - **Description**: Emotions are arranged in a circular structure based on their valence and arousal levels.
   - **Examples**: Joy (positive valence, high arousal), sadness (negative valence, low arousal).

2. **PAD Emotional State Model (Mehrabian and Russell, 1974)**
   - **Axes**: Pleasure, Arousal, and Dominance.
   - **Description**: Emotions are positioned in a three-dimensional space defined by pleasure, arousal, and dominance.
   - **Examples**: Relaxation (positive pleasure, low arousal, high dominance), anger (negative pleasure, high arousal, low dominance).

3. **Discrete Emotion Theory**
   - **Axes**: Discrete categories of basic emotions.
   - **Description**: Emotions are classified into a finite set of basic emotions, each with distinct characteristics.
   - **Examples**: Happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise, disgust.

4. **Appraisal Theories of Emotion**
   - **Axes**: Cognitive evaluations or appraisals.
   - **Description**: Emotions arise from individualsâ€™ evaluations of events based on their significance for personal well-being.
   - **Examples**: Anger (appraisal of injustice), fear (appraisal of threat).

### Conclusion

Classifying emotions along these dimensions and axes helps to systematically study and understand the multifaceted nature of emotional experiences. Each model or framework provides a unique perspective, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of how emotions function and impact human behavior.
