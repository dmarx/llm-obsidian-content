**USER**

characteristic polynomial of a matrix


**ASSISTANT**

The **characteristic polynomial** of a matrix is a fundamental concept in linear algebra that plays a crucial role in understanding the properties of matrices, particularly in the study of eigenvalues, matrix diagonalization, and stability analysis in differential equations.

### Definition

For an \( n \times n \) square matrix \( A \), the characteristic polynomial is defined as:
$$
p_A(\lambda) = \det(A - \lambda I)
$$
where:
- \( \lambda \) is a scalar,
- \( I \) is the \( n \times n \) identity matrix,
- \( \det \) denotes the determinant of a matrix.

This polynomial is a monic polynomial of degree \( n \) in \( \lambda \), and its roots are the eigenvalues of \( A \).

### Computation

To compute the characteristic polynomial, subtract \( \lambda I \) from \( A \) and then calculate the determinant of the resulting matrix. This process typically involves expanding the determinant, which leads to a polynomial expression in terms of \( \lambda \).

#### Example

Consider a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix \( A \):
$$
A = \begin{bmatrix}
a & b \\
c & d
\end{bmatrix}
$$
The characteristic polynomial \( p_A(\lambda) \) is computed as follows:
$$
p_A(\lambda) = \det(A - \lambda I) = \det \left(\begin{bmatrix}
a - \lambda & b \\
c & d - \lambda
\end{bmatrix}\right) = (a-\lambda)(d-\lambda) - bc
$$
This simplifies to:
$$
p_A(\lambda) = \lambda^2 - (a + d)\lambda + (ad - bc)
$$

### Properties

1. **Roots as Eigenvalues**:
   - The roots of the characteristic polynomial are exactly the eigenvalues of \( A \). If \( \lambda \) is a root of \( p_A(\lambda) \), then there exists a non-zero vector \( v \) such that \( Av = \lambda v \).

2. **Coefficients**:
   - The coefficient of \( \lambda^{n-1} \) (the term with degree \( n-1 \)) in \( p_A(\lambda) \) is the trace of \( A \) (sum of the diagonal elements) with a negative sign.
   - The constant term (coefficient of \( \lambda^0 \)) is \( (-1)^n \det(A) \), which represents the product of the eigenvalues.

3. **Algebraic Multiplicity**:
   - The multiplicity of a root \( \lambda \) of \( p_A(\lambda) \) is its algebraic multiplicity as an eigenvalue, indicating how many times that eigenvalue occurs.

### Applications

1. **Eigenvalue Analysis**:
   - Determining the eigenvalues of a matrix is crucial for analyzing systems in physics, engineering, and other sciences, particularly in studying system stability and solving differential equations.

2. **Spectral Decomposition**:
   - For matrices that are diagonalizable, understanding the characteristic polynomial helps in the spectral decomposition of the matrix into eigenvectors and eigenvalues, which is fundamental in quantum mechanics and other areas of physics.

3. **Invariant Theory**:
   - The characteristic polynomial is an invariant under similarity transformations, meaning that if two matrices \( A \) and \( B \) are similar, they have the same characteristic polynomial.

4. **Control Theory**:
   - In control theory, the characteristic polynomial of the system matrix is used to analyze and design control systems, especially to ensure the stability and responsiveness of the system.

The characteristic polynomial thus serves as a powerful tool in both theoretical and applied mathematics, providing deep insights into the behavior of linear transformations and their systems.
