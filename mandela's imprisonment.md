> Mandela's imprisonment


**ASSISTANT**

Nelson Mandela's imprisonment serves as a powerful symbol of the struggle for human rights and dignity, particularly in the context of the penal system. His 27-year incarceration under the apartheid regime in South Africa highlighted the severe injustices and inhumane conditions faced by prisoners, particularly political prisoners. Mandela's experience and his unwavering commitment to human rights inspired the renaming and revision of the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners to the Nelson Mandela Rules in 2015.

### Structure and Key Provisions

The Nelson Mandela Rules consist of 122 rules organized into nine parts, addressing various aspects of prison management and prisoner treatment. Here are some of the key areas covered:

1. **Basic Principles**
   - **Rule 1**: All prisoners shall be treated with respect for their inherent dignity and value as human beings.
   - **Rule 2**: There shall be no discrimination on grounds such as race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth, or other status.

2. **Accommodation (Rules 12-17)**
   - Prisoners must be provided with adequate living conditions, including proper ventilation, lighting, heating, and space.
   - Clean bedding and clothing should be supplied and maintained.

3. **Personal Hygiene (Rules 18-21)**
   - Facilities and supplies must be provided to allow prisoners to maintain personal hygiene.

4. **Healthcare (Rules 24-35)**
   - Prisoners should have access to healthcare services equivalent to those available in the community.
   - Medical care should be provided by qualified health professionals, and special attention should be given to the needs of prisoners with health issues.

5. **Discipline and Sanctions (Rules 36-46)**
   - Disciplinary measures must be humane and respect the dignity of prisoners.
   - Solitary confinement should be used only as a last resort, for the shortest possible time, and under strict conditions.

6. **Contact with the Outside World (Rules 58-63)**
   - Prisoners should be allowed regular contact with family and friends through visits, correspondence, and other means.
   - Efforts should be made to maintain family ties and support reintegration into society.
