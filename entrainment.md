# Entrainment

[[Entrainment]] refers to the process by which one system's oscillatory behavior synchronizes with another, typically more dominant or driving system. This phenomenon occurs across diverse fields including physics, biology, neuroscience, and complex systems theory.

## Mathematical Formalization

### Basic Coupled Oscillator Model

The most fundamental mathematical description of entrainment involves coupled oscillators. For two oscillators with phases $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$, the dynamics can be described by the [[Kuramoto model]]:

$$\frac{d\phi_1}{dt} = \omega_1 + K_{12}\sin(\phi_2 - \phi_1)$$
$$\frac{d\phi_2}{dt} = \omega_2 + K_{21}\sin(\phi_1 - \phi_2)$$

Where:
- $\omega_1, \omega_2$ are the natural frequencies of the oscillators
- $K_{12}, K_{21}$ are coupling strengths
- When $K_{12} \gg K_{21}$, oscillator 1 becomes entrained to oscillator 2

### General Vector Form

For a system of $n$ oscillators, the entrainment dynamics can be represented as:

$$\frac{d\boldsymbol{\phi}}{dt} = \boldsymbol{\omega} + \mathbf{K} \cdot \mathbf{F}(\boldsymbol{\phi})$$

Where:
- $\boldsymbol{\phi} = (\phi_1, \phi_2, ..., \phi_n)^T$ is the phase vector
- $\boldsymbol{\omega} = (\omega_1, \omega_2, ..., \omega_n)^T$ is the natural frequency vector
- $\mathbf{K}$ is the coupling matrix
- $\mathbf{F}$ represents interaction functions

### Order Parameter

The degree of entrainment in a population of oscillators can be quantified using the [[order parameter]] $r$:

$$r e^{i\psi} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{j=1}^{N} e^{i\phi_j}$$

Where:
- $r \in [0,1]$ measures the coherence (1 = perfect entrainment)
- $\psi$ represents the average phase
- $N$ is the number of oscillators

## Types of Entrainment

### Phase Entrainment

Occurs when the phases of oscillators synchronize while potentially maintaining different frequencies. The phase difference remains bounded:

$$|\phi_1(t) - \phi_2(t)| < \text{constant}$$

### Frequency Entrainment

Occurs when oscillators adjust to operate at the same frequency:

$$\lim_{t \to \infty} \left| \frac{d\phi_1}{dt} - \frac{d\phi_2}{dt} \right| = 0$$

### Amplitude Entrainment

Involves synchronization of both timing and magnitude:

$$\lim_{t \to \infty} |A_1(t) - A_2(t)| = 0$$

Where $A_i(t)$ represents the amplitude of oscillator $i$.

## Entrainment Windows and Arnold Tongues

The parameter regions where entrainment occurs form characteristic structures called [[Arnold tongues]]. For a driven oscillator with:

$$\frac{d\phi}{dt} = \omega + K\sin(\Omega t - \phi)$$

Entrainment occurs when:

$$\left| \frac{\omega - \Omega}{K} \right| \leq 1$$

This creates regions in the $(\omega, K)$ plane where the ratio of driving frequency to oscillator frequency is rational ($\Omega:\omega = p:q$).

## Applications in Different Domains

### Biological Rhythms

In biological systems, entrainment manifests as:

1. **[[Circadian entrainment]]**: Synchronization of internal body clock (with intrinsic period $\tau \approx 24$ hours) to environmental light-dark cycles following the model:

   $$\frac{d\phi}{dt} = \omega_{\text{internal}} + K \cdot I(t) \cdot \sin(\phi_{\text{light}} - \phi)$$

   Where $I(t)$ represents light intensity.

2. **[[Neural entrainment]]**: Brain oscillations synchronizing to external stimuli, modeled as:

   $$\frac{d\theta}{dt} = \omega_{\text{neural}} + K \cdot S(t) \cdot \mathcal{H}(\theta, \phi_{\text{stimulus}})$$

   Where $\mathcal{H}$ is a phase response function and $S(t)$ is stimulus strength.

### Physical Systems

1. **[[Mechanical resonance]]**: Vibrating systems adjusting to external forcing frequencies.
2. **[[Acoustic entrainment]]**: Sound oscillators synchronizing through medium coupling.
3. **[[Laser phase locking]]**: Quantum optical systems synchronizing emission.

### Computational Models

Entrainment can be modeled through various approaches:

1. **[[Phase response curves]]** (PRCs): Describing how perturbations affect oscillator phase
   
   $$\Delta\phi = Z(\phi) \cdot \text{stimulus}$$
   
   Where $Z(\phi)$ is the phase response function.

2. **[[Coupled map lattices]]**: Discrete-time models of spatially extended systems

   $$\phi_i^{t+1} = f(\phi_i^t) + \frac{K}{|\mathcal{N}_i|} \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}_i} g(\phi_j^t, \phi_i^t)$$

   Where $\mathcal{N}_i$ is the neighborhood of node $i$.

## Information-Theoretic Perspective

Entrainment can be quantified using [[information theory]]:

1. **[[Transfer entropy]]**: Directional information flow between systems

   $$T_{Y \to X} = \sum p(x_{t+1},x_t,y_t) \log \frac{p(x_{t+1}|x_t,y_t)}{p(x_{t+1}|x_t)}$$

2. **[[Mutual information]]**: Shared information between entrained systems

   $$I(X;Y) = \sum_{x,y} p(x,y) \log \frac{p(x,y)}{p(x)p(y)}$$

## Entrainment in Complex Systems

In [[complex systems]], entrainment often leads to:

1. **[[Emergent synchronization]]**: Spontaneous ordering across system components
2. **[[Metastability]]**: Systems dwelling near, but not at, synchronization states
3. **[[Chimera states]]**: Coexistence of synchronized and desynchronized regions

## Research Directions

1. Developing models of [[partial entrainment]] in heterogeneous networks
2. Investigating [[multiscale entrainment]] across temporal hierarchies
3. Exploring [[computational models of cross-frequency coupling]]
4. Advancing [[nonlinear entrainment theory]] beyond weakly coupled oscillators
5. Studying [[entrainment resilience]] to noise and perturbations
