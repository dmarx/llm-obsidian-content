Procedures as Arguments

### Procedures as Arguments

**Procedures as arguments** is a fundamental concept in [[procedural rhetoric]]. This concept posits that the rules and mechanics of a game themselves can be used to construct and convey persuasive arguments, much like traditional rhetoric uses language. By engaging with a game's systems and procedures, players are not merely passive recipients of a message; they actively participate in the construction and understanding of the argument through their interactions and decisions within the game.

#### Key Aspects of Procedures as Arguments

1. **Rule-based Systems**: The rules and mechanics of a game define the possible actions players can take and the consequences of those actions. These rules can model real-world systems, presenting simplified or abstracted versions of complex phenomena.

2. **Interactive Engagement**: Unlike traditional media, where the audience passively receives information, games require active participation. This interaction allows players to experience the consequences of their actions and decisions, making the argument more impactful.

3. **Implicit vs. Explicit Messaging**: Procedural arguments can be explicit, where the game's purpose is clearly to communicate a specific message, or implicit, where the argument emerges from the player's engagement with the game's mechanics.

4. **Experiential Learning**: By manipulating the game's rules and systems, players can experiment with different strategies and outcomes. This experiential approach can lead to a deeper understanding and internalization of the argument being made.

#### Examples of Procedures as Arguments

1. **"Papers, Please"**: In this game, players assume the role of a border control officer in a fictional dystopian country. The procedures for checking documents and making decisions about who to admit or deny entry are the core mechanics. These mechanics illustrate the dehumanizing and morally complex nature of bureaucratic systems, highlighting themes of power, ethics, and survival.

2. **"The Sims"**: This life simulation game allows players to control virtual people (Sims) and manage their daily activities, social interactions, and career paths. The procedures governing social dynamics, career progression, and personal fulfillment implicitly argue about the importance of balance, relationships, and personal well-being in everyday life.

3. **"Democracy"**: This political simulation game models the complexities of running a country. Players must make policy decisions and balance the interests of different social groups, all while maintaining popularity and addressing crises. The game's mechanics argue about the challenges and trade-offs inherent in governance and political decision-making.

#### Mathematical Formalization of Procedures as Arguments

To understand how procedures can function as arguments, it can be useful to formalize these procedures mathematically. This involves representing game mechanics as mathematical models, which can illustrate the underlying systems and rules that drive the game's arguments.

1. **Finite State Machines (FSMs)**: Represent the different states of a game and the transitions between them based on player actions. An FSM can be defined by a set of states \( S \), a set of inputs \( I \), and a transition function \( \delta: S \times I \rightarrow S \).

$$
\delta(s, i) = s'
$$

where \( s, s' \in S \) are states and \( i \in I \) is an input triggering the transition from state \( s \) to state \( s' \).

2. **Markov Chains**: Useful for modeling probabilistic state transitions where the next state depends only on the current state. A Markov chain is defined by a set of states \( S \) and a transition matrix \( P \) where \( P_{ij} \) represents the probability of transitioning from state \( i \) to state \( j \).

$$
P(X_{n+1} = x_{n+1} \mid X_n = x_n) = P_{x_n x_{n+1}}
$$

3. **Game Theory**: Analyzes strategic interactions where the outcome depends on the choices of multiple players. Payoff matrices can represent the rewards associated with different strategies. For a two-player game, the payoff matrix \( A \) can be written as:

$$
A = \begin{pmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1n} \\
a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{2n} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \cdots & a_{mn} \\
\end{pmatrix}
$$

where \( a_{ij} \) denotes the payoff for player 1 choosing strategy \( i \) and player 2 choosing strategy \( j \).

#### Application of Procedures as Arguments

1. **Educational Games**: Games designed for education can use procedures to argue about the importance of certain knowledge or skills. For example, a game teaching about climate change might use resource management mechanics to illustrate the impact of different environmental policies.

2. **Social and Political Commentary**: Games can make arguments about social and political issues through their mechanics. For example, a game might simulate the effects of wealth inequality by having players manage resources in a way that highlights the difficulties faced by disadvantaged groups.

3. **Training and Simulations**: Serious games and simulations used for training can embed arguments about best practices and effective strategies within their procedures. For example, a medical simulation game might use procedural mechanics to argue about the importance of certain protocols and procedures in patient care.

#### Conclusion

Procedures as arguments leverage the interactive nature of games to create persuasive experiences. By engaging with a game's mechanics, players can explore and internalize the arguments embedded within the rules and systems. This approach allows for a unique form of rhetoric that combines experiential learning with the persuasive power of interactive media.
