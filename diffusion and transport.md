Diffusion and transport


**ASSISTANT**

**Diffusion** and **transport** processes are critical to the understanding of combustion dynamics. These processes govern how heat, mass, and momentum are transferred in a flame, and they strongly affect flame structure, speed, and stability. In combustion, diffusion refers to the spread of species (fuel, oxidizer, and combustion products), while transport refers to the broader set of mechanisms by which mass, heat, and momentum move within the fluid. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of both concepts:

### 1. **Diffusion Processes in Combustion**

#### 1.1 **Mass Diffusion**

Mass diffusion describes the transport of chemical species (fuel, oxidizer, and intermediates) due to concentration gradients. In combustion, fuel and oxidizer must diffuse into the reaction zone for chemical reactions to occur. The diffusion of species is governed by **Fick's law of diffusion**:
$$
\mathbf{J}_i = -D_i \nabla c_i
$$
where:
- $\mathbf{J}_i$ is the diffusion flux of species $i$ (mass per area per time),
- $D_i$ is the mass diffusivity of species $i$,
- $\nabla c_i$ is the concentration gradient of species $i$.

The diffusivity $D_i$ describes how fast species $i$ spreads out due to molecular motion. In general:
- **Light molecules** (e.g., hydrogen) have higher diffusivities than heavy molecules (e.g., propane).
- Diffusion rates affect [[flame speed]] and flame thickness: species with higher diffusivities will move more quickly into the reaction zone, potentially increasing the burning rate.

#### 1.2 **Thermal Diffusion (Soret Effect)**

Thermal diffusion refers to the transport of species due to temperature gradients. This effect, also called the **Soret effect**, describes how particles or molecules diffuse from hotter to cooler regions. While less significant than mass diffusion in many combustion processes, the Soret effect can influence flame behavior in multi-component gas mixtures.

### 2. **Transport of Heat and Momentum**

#### 2.1 **Thermal Conductivity**

The **thermal conductivity** $\lambda$ governs how heat is transferred in a medium due to temperature gradients. The heat flux $\mathbf{q}$ is described by **Fourier's law** of heat conduction:
$$
\mathbf{q} = -\lambda \nabla T
$$
where:
- $\lambda$ is the thermal conductivity,
- $\nabla T$ is the temperature gradient.

Thermal conductivity plays a crucial role in:
- **Flame structure**: Heat must diffuse from the flame front into the unburned mixture to preheat it, enabling combustion to continue.
- **Flame stability**: If the heat transfer away from the flame front is too fast (due to high thermal conductivity), the flame can quench, leading to flame extinction.

In premixed flames, the balance between heat conduction and reaction rate defines the **flame thickness** and the **flame temperature profile**.

#### 2.2 **Viscous Transport (Momentum Diffusion)**

Momentum transport in fluids is described by **viscous diffusion**, which is the diffusion of momentum due to velocity gradients. The rate of momentum transport is governed by the **dynamic viscosity** $\mu$ of the fluid, and the momentum flux $\tau$ is given by:
$$
\tau = \mu \frac{\partial u}{\partial y}
$$
where $\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}$ is the velocity gradient in the direction normal to the flow.

Momentum diffusion affects:
- **Flame front dynamics**: In turbulent combustion, [[momentum diffusion]] interacts with the flame structure, potentially wrinkling or stretching the flame front.
- **Flame speed**: In laminar flames, the [[momentum diffusion]] is balanced by the chemical reaction rate. In turbulent flames, the interaction between [[turbulent eddies]] and the flame front dominates flame propagation.

### 3. **Dimensionless Numbers in Diffusion and Transport**

Several **dimensionless numbers** help characterize the relative importance of diffusion and transport processes in combustion systems:

#### 3.1 **Lewis Number ($Le$)**

The **Lewis number** ($Le$) compares thermal diffusivity to mass diffusivity:
$$
Le = \frac{\alpha}{D}
$$
where:
- $\alpha = \frac{\lambda}{\rho c_p}$ is the **thermal diffusivity**,
- $D$ is the **mass diffusivity** of a species.

The Lewis number determines the relative rates of heat and mass diffusion:
- For $Le = 1$, heat and species diffuse at the same rate.
- For $Le < 1$, species diffuse faster than heat, leading to **diffusive-thermal instabilities** in flames.
- For $Le > 1$, heat diffuses faster than species, which can result in broader flame fronts and less sensitivity to instabilities.

The Lewis number is particularly important for flames in which diffusion processes play a dominant role, such as **premixed flames** and **lean combustion** regimes.

#### 3.2 **Schmidt Number ($Sc$)**

The **Schmidt number** ($Sc$) compares momentum diffusivity (kinematic viscosity) to mass diffusivity:
$$
Sc = \frac{\nu}{D}
$$
where:
- $\nu = \frac{\mu}{\rho}$ is the kinematic viscosity,
- $D$ is the mass diffusivity of the species.

The Schmidt number is useful for describing the relative importance of viscous forces and species diffusion. In combustion, $Sc$ typically varies based on the specific gas mixture and conditions.

#### 3.3 **Prandtl Number ($Pr$)**

The **Prandtl number** ($Pr$) compares momentum diffusivity to thermal diffusivity:
$$
Pr = \frac{\nu}{\alpha}
$$
where:
- $\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity,
- $\alpha$ is the thermal diffusivity.

The Prandtl number helps determine the relationship between viscous and thermal diffusion. It influences **boundary layer development** in reactive flows, flame stability, and the interaction between flow and temperature fields.

### 4. **Flame Thickness and Diffusion**

The thickness of a flame front is determined by the relative rates of heat and mass diffusion and the reaction rate. In a **laminar premixed flame**, the flame thickness $L_f$ is often estimated as:
$$
L_f \sim \frac{\alpha}{S_L}
$$
where:
- $\alpha$ is the thermal diffusivity,
- $S_L$ is the laminar [[flame speed]].

The **flame thickness** is an important parameter for characterizing how steep the temperature and species gradients are across the flame front. Flames with a high diffusivity of heat or species will tend to have broader flame fronts, while those with lower diffusivity will have thinner fronts.

### 5. **Diffusion-Controlled Flames**

In some combustion systems, the flame propagation is **diffusion-controlled** rather than reaction-controlled. This is common in **non-premixed flames** (also called diffusion flames), where the fuel and oxidizer are initially separate and must diffuse into each other before reacting. In this case:
- The flame sits at the interface where the fuel and oxidizer meet, and the reaction rate is controlled by the rate of diffusion of species to the flame front.
- Examples include **jet flames** and **soot formation**, where the diffusion of oxygen into a fuel-rich zone governs the combustion process.

### Summary

In combustion, **diffusion** and **transport** processes are vital to understanding flame behavior. Key mechanisms include:
- **Mass diffusion**: Species (fuel, oxidizer) must diffuse into the flame zone.
- **Thermal diffusion**: Heat must spread from the reaction zone to preheat incoming reactants.
- **Momentum diffusion**: Governs the interaction between flow and the flame front.

Important dimensionless numbers such as the **Lewis number**, **Schmidt number**, and **Prandtl number** quantify the relative importance of these processes and help predict flame behavior, including flame thickness, stability, and speed. Understanding the interplay of diffusion and transport is key to predicting and controlling combustion in both laminar and turbulent systems.
