# Universal Algebra

[[Universal algebra]] provides a unified framework for studying algebraic structures through a systematic analysis of operations, equations, and their properties. This abstraction allows for the treatment of diverse mathematical structures under a common theoretical framework.

## Fundamental Concepts

### Signature
A [[signature]] (or type) τ consists of:
- A set of operation symbols F
- An arity function ar: F → ℕ

Formal notation:
τ = (F, ar)

### Terms
[[Term algebra|Terms]] are built inductively:
1. Variables are terms
2. If f ∈ F with ar(f) = n, and t₁,...,t₆ are terms, then f(t₁,...,tₙ) is a term

Formal construction:
T(X) = the set of terms over variables X

### Algebras
An [[algebra]] A of type τ consists of:
1. A carrier set |A|
2. For each f ∈ F with ar(f) = n, an operation f^A: |A|^n → |A|

## Universal Construction

### Free Algebra
For a signature τ and set X, the [[free algebra]] F(X) satisfies:
1. There exists an injection i: X → F(X)
2. For any τ-algebra A and function f: X → |A|, there exists a unique homomorphism f̂: F(X) → A extending f

```
X ---i--→ F(X)
|         |
f         f̂
↓         ↓
|A| -----id→ |A|
```

### Term Evaluation
[[Term evaluation]] φ maps terms to elements:
φ: T(X) → |A|
satisfying:
φ(f(t₁,...,tₙ)) = f^A(φ(t₁),...,φ(tₙ))

## Varieties and Equations

### Equations
An [[equation]] is a pair of terms (s,t), written s ≈ t
- Valid in algebra A if all evaluations give same result
- Forms basis for algebraic specifications

### Variety
A [[variety]] is a class of algebras satisfying:
1. Closed under subalgebras
2. Closed under products
3. Closed under homomorphic images

[[Birkhoff's theorem]]: A class of algebras is a variety iff it is equationally definable.

## Categorical Perspective

### Category of Algebras
For signature τ, Alg(τ) forms a category:
- Objects: τ-algebras
- Morphisms: homomorphisms

Properties:
1. Complete
2. Cocomplete
3. Has free objects

### Algebraic Functors
Important functors include:
1. Forgetful functor U: Alg(τ) → SET
2. Free functor F: SET → Alg(τ)
3. F ⊣ U (F left adjoint to U)

## Computational Aspects

### Term Rewriting
[[Term rewriting system|Term rewriting systems]] provide:
1. Computational model for equations
2. Confluence analysis
3. Termination theory

### Unification
[[Unification theory]] studies:
1. Finding common instances of terms
2. Most general unifiers
3. Applications to theorem proving

## Advanced Topics

### Algebraic Theories
[[Algebraic theory|Algebraic theories]] provide:
1. Category-theoretic formulation
2. Lawvere theories
3. Enriched theories

### Universal Constructions
1. [[Product algebra]]
2. [[Quotient algebra]]
3. [[Subalgebra]]
4. [[Direct limit]]

### Maltsev Conditions
[[Maltsev condition|Maltsev conditions]] characterize:
1. Permutability of congruences
2. Existence of majority terms
3. Congruence modularity

## Applications

1. [[Abstract Data Types]]
- Specification
- Implementation
- Verification

2. [[Programming Language Semantics]]
- Denotational semantics
- Operational semantics
- Type systems

3. [[Automated Theorem Proving]]
- Term rewriting
- Equation solving
- Proof strategies

4. [[Constraint Satisfaction]]
- Problem formulation
- Solution methods
- Complexity analysis

This systematic approach to algebraic structures provides powerful tools for understanding and working with mathematical abstractions across various domains.
