### Evidence of Minimal Inflationary Effects from UBI Pilots

Empirical evidence from UBI pilot programs in Namibia and Madhya Pradesh indicates that inflationary effects were minimal and manageable. These programs demonstrated increased economic activity without causing significant inflation, addressing a common concern regarding UBI implementation.

### Namibia’s Basic Income Grant (2008-2009)

**Overview:**
- **Location:** Otjivero-Omitara, Namibia
- **Participants:** All residents under 60 years old
- **Amount:** 100 Namibian dollars (approximately $12) per month
- **Duration:** January 2008 - December 2009

**Findings:**
1. **Economic Activity:**
   - The Basic Income Grant (BIG) led to increased local economic activity. Residents used the grant to improve nutrition, healthcare, and education, as well as invest in small businesses.
   - The grant stimulated local markets and created a positive economic multiplier effect, benefiting the broader community.

2. **Inflation:**
   - **Minimal Inflationary Impact:** The inflationary effects were minimal and manageable. The small scale of the pilot and the incremental nature of the income infusion helped mitigate significant price increases.
   - **Local Production Increase:** The increase in local production and services, driven by the recipients' spending, helped absorb the additional demand without leading to substantial price rises.

3. **Well-Being:**
   - **Improved Health and Education:** The BIG improved health outcomes, reduced malnutrition, and increased school attendance. These improvements contributed to long-term economic benefits.

### Madhya Pradesh, India (2011-2012)

**Overview:**
- **Implementing Organization:** Self-Employed Women’s Association (SEWA)
- **Location:** Rural Madhya Pradesh
- **Participants:** All individuals in selected villages
- **Amount:** 200 Indian rupees (approximately $2.80) per adult and 100 rupees per child per month
- **Duration:** 12 months

**Findings:**
1. **Economic Activity:**
   - **Increased Investment:** Recipients used the basic income to invest in agricultural practices, start small enterprises, and improve their homes. This led to increased productivity and economic diversification.
   - **Consumption and Savings:** The basic income enabled higher consumption of essential goods and services and allowed for some savings, providing a financial buffer against shocks.

2. **Inflation:**
   - **Minimal Inflationary Impact:** The pilot project observed minimal inflationary effects. The additional income was absorbed by the local economy through increased production and improved supply chains.
   - **Balanced Demand and Supply:** The increased demand was matched by an increase in local supply, preventing significant price increases.

3. **Well-Being:**
   - **Enhanced Health and Education:** Recipients reported better health and higher school attendance rates, contributing to improved human capital and long-term economic potential.

### Conclusion

The evidence from UBI pilots in Namibia and Madhya Pradesh indicates that inflationary effects were minimal and manageable. These programs demonstrated increased economic activity, improved well-being, and enhanced economic stability without causing significant inflation. The pilots highlight the potential for UBI to stimulate local economies and support vulnerable populations while maintaining price stability. Policymakers can draw on these findings to design and implement UBI programs that maximize benefits and mitigate potential drawbacks.
