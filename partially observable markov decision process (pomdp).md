## Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP)

### Introduction

A Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) is a framework for modeling decision-making problems where the agent does not have full visibility of the system state. Instead, the agent receives observations that provide partial information about the state, making the decision-making process more complex. POMDPs are widely used in fields such as robotics, automated control, and artificial intelligence to handle situations with uncertainty and incomplete information.

### Formal Definition

A POMDP is defined by the tuple \( (\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{O}, T, Z, R, \gamma) \), where:

- \( \mathcal{S} \): A finite set of states.
- \( \mathcal{A} \): A finite set of actions.
- \( \mathcal{O} \): A finite set of observations.
- \( T(s' | s, a) \): The state transition probability, which gives the probability of moving to state \( s' \) from state \( s \) after taking action \( a \).
- \( Z(o | s', a) \): The observation probability, which gives the probability of observing \( o \) after taking action \( a \) and transitioning to state \( s' \).
- \( R(s, a) \): The reward function, which gives the immediate reward received after taking action \( a \) in state \( s \).
- \( \gamma \): The discount factor, \( 0 \leq \gamma \leq 1 \), which determines the importance of future rewards.

### Belief State

In a POMDP, the agent maintains a belief state \( b \), which is a probability distribution over the possible states. The belief state is updated based on the actions taken and the observations received using Bayes' rule. The belief update equation is:
$$
b'(s') = \eta Z(o | s', a) \sum_{s \in \mathcal{S}} T(s' | s, a) b(s),
$$
where \( \eta \) is a normalization constant ensuring that \( b'(s') \) sums to 1 over all states \( s' \).

### Objective

The objective in a POMDP is to find a policy \( \pi \) that maximizes the expected cumulative reward over time, given the partial observability. The optimal policy can be represented as:
$$
\pi^* = \arg \max_\pi \mathbb{E} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t R(s_t, a_t) \mid \pi, b_0 \right],
$$
where \( b_0 \) is the initial belief state, and the expectation is taken over the possible sequences of states, actions, and observations.

### Solution Methods

#### Value Iteration

Value iteration for POMDPs involves computing the value function \( V(b) \) for belief states. The value function is updated iteratively using:
$$
V(b) = \max_{a \in \mathcal{A}} \left[ R(b, a) + \gamma \sum_{o \in \mathcal{O}} P(o | b, a) V(b^a_o) \right],
$$
where \( R(b, a) \) is the expected reward for taking action \( a \) in belief state \( b \), \( P(o | b, a) \) is the probability of receiving observation \( o \) after taking action \( a \), and \( b^a_o \) is the updated belief state.

#### Policy Iteration

Policy iteration involves evaluating and improving a policy iteratively. The steps are:
1. **Policy Evaluation**: Compute the value function \( V^\pi(b) \) for the current policy \( \pi \).
2. **Policy Improvement**: Update the policy by selecting actions that maximize the value function:
$$
\pi'(b) = \arg \max_{a \in \mathcal{A}} \left[ R(b, a) + \gamma \sum_{o \in \mathcal{O}} P(o | b, a) V^\pi(b^a_o) \right].
$$

#### Point-Based Value Iteration (PBVI)

PBVI is an approximate solution method that focuses on a finite set of belief points. The algorithm iteratively updates the value function for these belief points, making it computationally feasible for large POMDPs. Key steps include:
1. **Belief Point Selection**: Select a set of representative belief points.
2. **Value Function Update**: Update the value function for each belief point using a backup operator.

#### Monte Carlo Methods

Monte Carlo methods use sampling to estimate the value function and policy. These methods are useful when the state and action spaces are large. Examples include:
- **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**: Builds a search tree based on sampled trajectories, guiding the search towards promising actions.
- **Particle Filters**: Approximate the belief state using a set of particles, updating their weights based on observations.

### Applications

#### Robotics

In robotics, POMDPs are used for tasks such as navigation, localization, and manipulation, where the robot must operate under uncertainty and partial observability. For example, a robot may need to navigate a partially known environment using noisy sensor data to update its belief about its location.

#### Healthcare

POMDPs are applied in healthcare for decision support systems, such as personalized treatment planning where patient states are not fully observable, and medical tests provide uncertain information.

#### Autonomous Vehicles

Autonomous vehicles use POMDPs for planning and decision-making in dynamic and uncertain environments, such as navigating through traffic where the behavior of other drivers is uncertain.

### Challenges and Limitations

#### Scalability

The primary challenge in solving POMDPs is scalability. The state, action, and observation spaces can be very large, making exact solutions computationally infeasible.

#### Belief Space Complexity

The belief space is continuous and high-dimensional, which complicates the representation and computation of the belief state and value functions.

#### Approximation Methods

Approximation methods such as PBVI and Monte Carlo methods provide practical solutions, but they may still struggle with very large or highly uncertain environments.

### Conclusion

POMDPs provide a powerful framework for modeling decision-making under uncertainty and partial observability. Despite their computational challenges, advances in approximation algorithms and computational power continue to expand their applicability across various domains, including robotics, healthcare, and autonomous systems. Combining POMDPs with [[intrinsic motivation]] principles like [[empowerment maximization]] can further enhance the adaptability and robustness of decision-making agents in complex environments.
