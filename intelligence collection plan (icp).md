Intelligence Collection Plan (ICP)


**ASSISTANT**

An **Intelligence Collection Plan (ICP)** is a structured framework used in military operations to coordinate and prioritize the collection of intelligence information necessary for decision-making. The ICP aligns intelligence gathering efforts with the commander's critical information requirements (CCIRs), priority intelligence requirements (PIRs), and friendly force information requirements (FFIRs). It ensures that all available intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) assets are optimally employed to provide timely and accurate information that supports operational planning and execution.

## Objectives of an Intelligence Collection Plan

1. **Identify Information Needs**: Determine the specific intelligence requirements that need to be collected to support mission objectives and decision-making processes.
2. **Prioritize Collection Efforts**: Allocate resources and prioritize intelligence collection based on the importance and urgency of each requirement.
3. **Coordinate ISR Assets**: Ensure that all ISR assets (such as satellites, drones, reconnaissance aircraft, human intelligence (HUMINT), and electronic intelligence (ELINT)) are effectively utilized and their efforts are synchronized.
4. **Monitor and Adjust**: Continuously monitor the effectiveness of the collection efforts, adjust the plan as necessary based on new information or changes in the operational environment, and redirect resources to address emerging intelligence needs.
5. **Support Decision-Making**: Provide timely, relevant, and actionable intelligence to commanders and decision-makers to support planning, operations, and risk management.

## Components of an Intelligence Collection Plan

An effective ICP typically includes several key components to ensure comprehensive and coordinated intelligence collection:

### 1. **Collection Requirements**

**Collection Requirements** are the specific pieces of information that need to be gathered to fulfill the commander’s intelligence needs. These are derived from PIRs, FFIRs, and other intelligence needs identified during [[mission analysis]]. 

- **Priority Intelligence Requirements (PIRs)**: Information about the enemy and the environment that is critical to mission success.
- **Friendly Force Information Requirements (FFIRs)**: Information about the status and capabilities of friendly forces.
- **Essential Elements of Friendly Information (EEFI)**: Information that must be protected to prevent the enemy from gaining an advantage.

### 2. **Collection Assets and Capabilities**

**Collection Assets and Capabilities** include all available ISR resources that can be used to gather the required intelligence. This encompasses a wide range of capabilities, including:

- **Human Intelligence (HUMINT)**: Information gathered from human sources, such as informants, defectors, or direct observation by military personnel.
- **Signals Intelligence (SIGINT)**: Information obtained from intercepted communications and electronic signals.
- **Imagery Intelligence (IMINT)**: Visual information captured from satellites, drones, reconnaissance aircraft, or ground-based systems.
- **Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT)**: Intelligence derived from the analysis of geographical information and spatial data.
- **Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT)**: Intelligence obtained from sensors that detect chemical, biological, nuclear, or physical signatures.

### 3. **Collection Priorities**

**Collection Priorities** rank the collection requirements based on their importance to the mission and their urgency. This prioritization ensures that the most critical information needs are addressed first and that limited ISR resources are allocated effectively.

- **High-Priority Requirements**: Directly impact mission success and are needed immediately for decision-making.
- **Medium-Priority Requirements**: Important but not immediately critical, often related to supporting or secondary objectives.
- **Low-Priority Requirements**: Useful for long-term planning or situational awareness but not essential for immediate operations.

### 4. **Tasking of Collection Assets**

**Tasking** involves assigning specific collection tasks to each ISR asset based on its capabilities and the prioritized requirements. Tasking includes:

- **Specific Intelligence Requirements (SIRs)**: Detailed tasks assigned to collection assets, specifying what information to collect, when to collect it, and how to report it.
- **Asset Allocation**: Determining which assets are best suited to collect each type of information based on their capabilities, availability, and location.
- **Synchronization**: Ensuring that the timing and focus of each asset are coordinated to avoid duplication and maximize coverage.

### 5. **Collection Timelines**

**Collection Timelines** establish deadlines for when specific information needs to be collected and reported. Timelines are often aligned with critical decision points in the operation, ensuring that intelligence is available when needed.

- **Near-Term Collection**: Information needed in the immediate future to support ongoing or imminent operations.
- **Mid-Term Collection**: Information needed to support planning and preparation for upcoming phases of the operation.
- **Long-Term Collection**: Information that supports future operations or broader strategic objectives.

### 6. **Dissemination Plan**

The **Dissemination Plan** outlines how collected intelligence will be processed, analyzed, and disseminated to the relevant decision-makers and units. This ensures that information flows efficiently from collection assets to those who need it.

- **Processing and Exploitation**: Steps to convert raw data into usable intelligence, including decryption, translation, analysis, and interpretation.
- **Dissemination Channels**: Communication networks and methods used to distribute intelligence, ensuring secure and timely delivery.
- **Classification and Handling**: Guidelines for handling sensitive or classified information, ensuring that it is shared only with authorized personnel.

### 7. **Assessment and Feedback Mechanisms**

**Assessment and Feedback Mechanisms** are critical for evaluating the effectiveness of the collection effort and making necessary adjustments to the ICP.

- **Collection Effectiveness Reviews**: Regular assessments of how well collection assets are meeting the identified requirements and contributing to decision-making.
- **Adjustments and Re-Tasking**: Updating the ICP based on the results of the effectiveness reviews, new intelligence needs, or changes in the operational environment.
- **Feedback from Commanders and Analysts**: Gathering input from users of the intelligence to understand their needs better and improve future collection efforts.

## Developing an Intelligence Collection Plan

The process of developing an ICP involves several steps to ensure that the plan is comprehensive, prioritized, and aligned with the operational needs:

### 1. **Identify Intelligence Requirements**

The first step is to identify the intelligence requirements based on the mission objectives, the commander’s intent, and the operational environment. This involves:

- Reviewing the **Commander’s Critical Information Requirements (CCIRs)** to identify specific information needs.
- Consulting with key staff and subordinate commanders to understand their information needs and priorities.
- Analyzing the operational environment, enemy capabilities, and potential [[courses of action]] to identify intelligence gaps.

### 2. **Determine Available Collection Assets and Capabilities**

Identify all available ISR assets and their capabilities to determine how best to collect the required information. This includes:

- Inventorying the available collection platforms (e.g., drones, satellites, ground-based sensors) and their capabilities (e.g., range, resolution, endurance).
- Assessing the availability of human intelligence resources (e.g., liaison teams, local informants).
- Understanding the limitations and constraints of each asset, such as weather dependence or operational range.

### 3. **Prioritize Intelligence Requirements**

Prioritize the intelligence requirements based on their importance to the mission and the urgency of the need for information. This prioritization helps ensure that the most critical intelligence needs are addressed first and that resources are allocated effectively.

- Develop a priority list that ranks each intelligence requirement based on its impact on decision-making and mission success.
- Coordinate with command staff to ensure that prioritization aligns with the overall operational objectives and commander’s intent.

### 4. **Assign Collection Tasks and Allocate Assets**

Assign specific collection tasks to each ISR asset based on their capabilities and the prioritized requirements. This involves:

- Developing **Specific Intelligence Requirements (SIRs)** that detail what information is needed, when, and by whom.
- Allocating ISR assets to each SIR based on their capabilities, availability, and location relative to the target area.
- Synchronizing asset tasking to ensure comprehensive coverage of the operational environment and minimize redundancy.

### 5. **Establish Collection Timelines and Synchronize Efforts**

Establish collection timelines that align with the operational phases and critical decision points. Ensure that collection efforts are synchronized across different ISR assets to provide continuous coverage and timely reporting.

- Set deadlines for each collection task to ensure that intelligence is available when needed.
- Coordinate with ISR asset managers to deconflict collection efforts and optimize coverage of the target area.

### 6. **Develop the Dissemination Plan**

Develop a dissemination plan that outlines how collected intelligence will be processed, analyzed, and delivered to the relevant decision-makers and units. This plan should include:

- Procedures for processing and exploiting raw data to produce actionable intelligence.
- Methods for disseminating intelligence, including secure communication channels and reporting formats.
- Guidelines for handling and distributing classified or sensitive information.

### 7. **Implement the ICP and Monitor Effectiveness**

Implement the ICP by tasking ISR assets and coordinating collection efforts with subordinate units and supporting agencies. Monitor the effectiveness of the collection efforts and make adjustments as necessary.

- **Track collection progress**: Continuously monitor ISR operations to ensure that they are on track to meet the identified requirements and timelines.
- **Assess collection effectiveness**: Regularly evaluate how well the collected intelligence meets the commander’s needs and contributes to decision-making.
- **Adjust the plan as needed**: Update the ICP based on new intelligence needs, changes in the operational environment, or feedback from commanders and analysts.

## Tools and Techniques for Managing an ICP

Several tools and techniques can be used to manage and execute an ICP effectively:

### 1. **Collection Management Software**

**Collection Management Software** helps automate and streamline the planning, tasking, and tracking of ISR operations. These tools allow for real-time monitoring of ISR assets, prioritize collection tasks, and ensure that all efforts are aligned with the ICP.

### 2. **Intelligence Requirements Management (IRM) Tools**

**IRM Tools** assist in managing and prioritizing intelligence requirements by providing a centralized platform for tracking requests, tasking assets, and monitoring collection status. They ensure that all
