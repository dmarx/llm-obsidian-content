Vortex shedding frequency is characterized by the Strouhal number


**ASSISTANT**

**Vortex shedding frequency** is characterized by the **Strouhal number** ($St$), a dimensionless number that describes the relationship between the frequency of vortex shedding, the flow velocity, and a [[characteristic length scale]] of the object causing the shedding. Vortex shedding occurs when alternating vortices are formed downstream of a bluff body in a flow, resulting in a periodic flow pattern.

### Definition of the Strouhal Number

The **Strouhal number** is defined as:
$$
St = \frac{f L}{u}
$$
where:
- $St$ is the Strouhal number,
- $f$ is the **vortex shedding frequency** (the frequency at which vortices are shed from the body, in Hz),
- $L$ is a **characteristic length** of the object (e.g., the diameter of a cylinder or sphere, or the width of an obstacle),
- $u$ is the **free-stream velocity** of the fluid.

The Strouhal number expresses the ratio of the inertial forces (which drive vortex shedding) to the velocity of the flow. It quantifies how the shedding frequency depends on the flow speed and the size of the object causing the vortex shedding.

### Physical Interpretation

- **Vortex shedding frequency** ($f$) is the rate at which alternating vortices are generated behind a bluff body as fluid flows past it. This phenomenon results in the formation of a repeating pattern of vortices, known as a **von Kármán vortex street**.
- The Strouhal number provides a way to generalize the behavior of vortex shedding across different flow conditions. For a given object shape and flow regime, the Strouhal number tends to remain relatively constant over a wide range of Reynolds numbers.

### Typical Values of the Strouhal Number

For many common bluff bodies, the Strouhal number remains relatively constant across a wide range of Reynolds numbers. For example:
- **Circular cylinders** typically have a Strouhal number of approximately $St \approx 0.2$ over a Reynolds number range of $10^3 \leq Re \leq 10^5$. This means that, for a cylinder, the vortex shedding frequency $f$ is proportional to the flow velocity $u$ and the cylinder diameter $L$.

For a circular cylinder, the frequency of vortex shedding can be approximated by rearranging the Strouhal number formula:
$$
f = \frac{St \cdot u}{L}
$$
If the Strouhal number is known (e.g., $St = 0.2$), the frequency of vortex shedding can be predicted based on the flow velocity and the characteristic length of the body.

### Dependence on Reynolds Number

The behavior of vortex shedding and the value of the Strouhal number depend on the **Reynolds number** ($Re$), which characterizes the flow regime around the object. The Reynolds number is defined as:
$$
Re = \frac{u L}{\nu}
$$
where $\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid.

- At **low Reynolds numbers** (e.g., $Re < 100$), vortex shedding does not occur, and the flow is steady and laminar.
- At **moderate Reynolds numbers** ($100 \leq Re \leq 10^5$), vortex shedding is periodic and regular, and the Strouhal number remains relatively constant (typically around 0.2 for circular cylinders).
- At **high Reynolds numbers** ($Re > 10^5$), the flow becomes more turbulent, and the vortex shedding can become irregular and chaotic. The Strouhal number may vary in this regime.

### Vortex Shedding and Flow-Induced Oscillations

Vortex shedding can induce **flow-induced vibrations** in structures exposed to the flow. When the shedding frequency matches the natural frequency of the structure, **resonance** can occur, leading to **aeroelastic flutter** or **vortex-induced vibrations** (VIV). This is an important consideration in the design of tall buildings, bridges, chimneys, offshore platforms, and aircraft components.

For example:
- **Tall chimneys** or **bridge cables** can oscillate due to vortex shedding, causing structural vibrations.
- **Aeroelastic flutter** in aircraft wings can be driven by vortex shedding in certain flow conditions.

To prevent or mitigate such flow-induced vibrations, engineers may modify the design of the structure (e.g., changing its shape to minimize vortex shedding), or employ devices like **vortex generators** or **tuned mass dampers**.

### Example: Vortex Shedding in Flow Around a Cylinder

Consider fluid flowing around a circular cylinder of diameter $L = 0.1$ m (10 cm) with a free-stream velocity of $u = 5$ m/s. The Strouhal number for a cylinder is approximately $St = 0.2$. Using the formula for vortex shedding frequency, we can calculate the frequency as:
$$
f = \frac{St \cdot u}{L} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 5}{0.1} = 10 \text{ Hz}
$$
Thus, the vortex shedding frequency is 10 Hz, meaning that alternating vortices are shed from the cylinder at a rate of 10 times per second.

### Strouhal Number in Other Applications

The Strouhal number is widely used to characterize periodic flow phenomena in a variety of applications, including:

1. **Animal Locomotion**:
   - The Strouhal number is used to describe the frequency of flapping wings or undulating fins in flying and swimming animals. For efficient locomotion, many animals maintain a Strouhal number in the range of $0.2 \leq St \leq 0.4$ when swimming or flying.

2. **Piping and Structures**:
   - In fluid-structure interactions, such as flow past chimneys, bridge cables, or offshore structures, the Strouhal number helps predict the frequency of vortex-induced oscillations, which is important for designing against fatigue and structural failure.

3. **Aerospace Engineering**:
   - In the design of aircraft wings and wind turbines, the Strouhal number helps analyze flow separation and vortex shedding, which can cause lift fluctuations and noise.

### Summary

The **Strouhal number** ($St$) is a dimensionless number that characterizes the frequency of **vortex shedding** behind bluff bodies in fluid flow. It is defined as the ratio of the vortex shedding frequency to the product of the flow velocity and a [[characteristic length scale]] of the object. The Strouhal number typically remains constant for a wide range of Reynolds numbers and is used to predict vortex shedding frequency in applications involving flow around cylinders, spheres, and other bluff bodies. Vortex shedding can induce flow-induced oscillations and vibrations in structures, making it an important consideration in engineering designs.
