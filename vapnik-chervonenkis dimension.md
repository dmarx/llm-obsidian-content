# Vapnik-Chervonenkis Dimension

The [[Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension]] (VC dimension) provides a formal measure of the capacity or expressiveness of a class of functions in statistical and machine learning theory. It quantifies the fundamental complexity of a learning task by measuring how many points a class of functions can shatter.

## Formal Definition

### Shattering

A function class F [[shatters]] a set of points X if:
∀b ∈ {0,1}^|X| ∃f ∈ F : f(x_i) = b_i

More formally, F shatters X if:
|{(f(x₁),...,f(x_n)) : f ∈ F}| = 2^n

where:
- n = |X| is the number of points
- f(x_i) represents the classification of point x_i
- b_i represents any possible binary labeling

### VC Dimension

The VC dimension of a function class F is:

VC(F) = max{n : ∃X, |X| = n, F shatters X}

If F can shatter arbitrarily large sets, then VC(F) = ∞.

## Fundamental Properties

### Growth Function

The [[growth function]] π_F(n) is defined as:

π_F(n) = max{|{(f(x₁),...,f(x_n)) : f ∈ F}| : x₁,...,x_n ∈ X}

Sauer's Lemma relates this to VC dimension:

If |F| < ∞, then π_F(n) ≤ Σᵢ₌₀ᵈ (n choose i)

where d = VC(F)

### Sample Complexity Bounds

For [[PAC learning]], the required sample size n satisfies:

n ≥ O((VC(F) + log(1/δ))/ε²)

where:
- ε is the desired accuracy
- δ is the confidence parameter

## Examples

### Linear Classifiers

For hyperplanes in R^d:
VC(hyperplanes) = d + 1

Proof sketch:
1. d + 1 points in general position can be shattered
2. d + 2 points cannot be shattered (by geometric argument)

### Neural Networks

For feedforward networks:
VC(network) ≤ O(W log W)

where W is the number of weights.

## Applications

### Model Selection

The [[structural risk minimization]] principle uses VC dimension to select model complexity:

R(f) ≤ R_emp(f) + √(VC(F)log(n)/n)

where:
- R(f) is true risk
- R_emp(f) is empirical risk
- n is sample size

### Generalization Bounds

The [[generalization error]] E is bounded by:

E ≤ O(√(VC(F)log(n)/n))

This provides a theoretical foundation for:
1. Required training set size
2. Model capacity selection
3. Learning algorithm design

## Advanced Concepts

### Pseudo-Dimension

For real-valued functions, the [[pseudo-dimension]] PD(F) extends VC dimension:

PD(F) = VC({(x,t) : f(x) > t, f ∈ F})

### Fat-Shattering Dimension

The [[fat-shattering dimension]] fat_γ(F) at scale γ is:

fat_γ(F) = max{n : ∃X, |X| = n, F γ-shatters X}

where γ-shattering allows for margin:
|f(x_i) - b_i| ≥ γ
