**USER**

notable or famous or infamous alt.* [[newsgroups]]


**ASSISTANT**

The **`alt.* hierarchy`** on Usenet became home to many notable, famous, and sometimes infamous [[newsgroups]] due to its open, decentralized nature. Users could create groups on almost any topic, which led to a wide variety of communities. Some were well-regarded for their niche focus or humor, while others gained notoriety due to controversial content or legal conflicts.

### Famous and Infamous `alt.*` Newsgroups

#### 1. **`alt.religion.scientology`**
   - **Notoriety**: This newsgroup became highly controversial due to its critical discussions of the **Church of Scientology**. Created in 1991, it quickly became a hotbed for debate and dissent about the church, its practices, and its leaders. Members posted leaks of internal documents and criticisms, leading to lawsuits from the Church of Scientology.
   - **Impact**: This newsgroup is particularly significant because it sparked the first well-documented **cyber-activism** movement. In the 1990s, it became ground zero for online opposition to Scientology, which eventually culminated in the **Project Chanology** protests by the hacktivist group **Anonymous** in the 2000s.
   - **Legacy**: The conflict between Scientology and Usenet users over `alt.religion.scientology` played a key role in shaping internet culture, including the principles of **online free speech** and digital activism.

#### 2. **`alt.sex`**
   - **Notoriety**: This newsgroup was part of the early internet's uncensored exploration of **adult content** and sexual discussions. `alt.sex` became notorious for hosting conversations about various sexual topics, ranging from general discussions to more explicit material.
   - **Controversies**: Due to its unmoderated nature, it sometimes featured content that crossed into illegal territory (e.g., child pornography), which led to increased scrutiny from law enforcement. The visibility of groups like `alt.sex` contributed to the broader **debates about internet regulation** and content moderation.
   - **Impact**: It was one of the first large-scale online communities to explore taboo topics, pushing the boundaries of what was acceptable in open internet forums, which fed into larger debates about censorship on the internet.

#### 3. **`alt.drugs`**
   - **Notoriety**: This newsgroup was devoted to discussions about **recreational drug use**. Users would exchange information on the effects, risks, and sourcing of various drugs, including illegal substances. It became a controversial group due to the openness of its discussions about drug procurement and consumption.
   - **Law Enforcement Attention**: Like `alt.sex`, the illegal nature of some of the topics discussed on `alt.drugs` attracted law enforcement and led to legal actions against certain posters. The group illustrated the tensions between the open nature of Usenet and the legal issues surrounding illicit activities.
   - **Legacy**: `alt.drugs` foreshadowed modern internet forums and communities dedicated to harm reduction, drug education, and activism surrounding drug policy.

#### 4. **`alt.humor`**
   - **Famous**: A well-known newsgroup for **jokes and humor** that attracted users posting funny stories, one-liners, and humorous commentary on current events. It was a space for lighthearted discussion, in contrast to some of the more serious or controversial `alt.*` groups.
   - **Subgroups**: `alt.humor` spawned multiple subgroups, such as `alt.humor.best-of-[[usenet]]`, which highlighted some of the best and funniest posts across Usenet, and `alt.humor.puns`, focusing specifically on **puns and wordplay**.
   - **Impact**: Many early internet memes and jokes circulated through `alt.humor` before spreading to other online platforms. The sense of community around shared humor made this group a foundational part of early internet culture.

#### 5. **`alt.binaries.*`**
   - **Infamous**: The `alt.binaries` hierarchy was a large collection of [[newsgroups]] where users could post **binary files** (i.e., non-text data such as images, videos, and software). These groups became notorious for the distribution of **pirated software**, movies, music, and other copyrighted material, often violating intellectual property laws.
   - **Specific Groups**:
     - **`alt.binaries.movies`** – A popular group for sharing movie files, often illegally.
     - **`alt.binaries.pictures.erotica`** – A group known for distributing adult images, some of which were legally dubious.
   - **Legacy**: `alt.binaries.*` was a precursor to modern file-sharing platforms like **BitTorrent** and **P2P networks**, but it also illustrated the legal challenges of decentralized content distribution.

#### 6. **`alt.tv.simpsons`**
   - **Famous**: A dedicated newsgroup for discussing the **TV show *The Simpsons***. Launched in the early 1990s, this group became a gathering place for **fans**, who would discuss episodes, characters, and cultural references. It gained attention for its passionate user base and detailed analysis of episodes.
   - **Impact**: This group was one of the earliest examples of **fandom culture** online, where people gathered to share in-depth knowledge and enthusiasm about a particular media franchise. Its popularity foreshadowed the rise of large-scale fan communities on the internet.

#### 7. **`alt.conspiracy`**
   - **Infamous**: One of the earliest online hubs for **conspiracy theories**. This group discussed a wide range of topics, from government cover-ups to UFOs, secret societies, and mind control experiments. It was a magnet for individuals skeptical of mainstream media and government narratives.
   - **Impact**: `alt.conspiracy` played a role in shaping the **alternative media** landscape that has since grown across other platforms, influencing how conspiracy theories spread on the internet. It is an early example of how the internet can serve as an echo chamber for such theories.

#### 8. **`alt.flame`**
   - **Infamous**: This newsgroup was created for the explicit purpose of **"flaming"**—a term used for insulting or aggressively arguing with others. Users in `alt.flame` would engage in heated, and often vitriolic, exchanges, reveling in the chaos.
   - **Impact**: It became known as a space for **trolls** and those who enjoyed stirring up conflict, making it one of the earliest forums for online trolling behavior. `alt.flame` demonstrated how anonymity and lack of moderation can lead to toxic behavior, an issue still prevalent in online communities today.

#### 9. **`alt.fan` Hierarchy**
   - **Famous**: The **`alt.fan.*`** groups were dedicated to various **fan communities**, much like today's subreddit fan pages or fandom wikis. Examples include:
     - **`alt.fan.starwars`** – For **Star Wars** enthusiasts, discussing everything from movies to fan theories.
     - **`alt.fan.tolkien`** – For fans of **J.R.R. Tolkien**, discussing his books, adaptations, and fantasy themes.
   - **Impact**: These groups were among the first places where online fandoms formed, providing early examples of **fan-driven content** and discussions.

### Conclusion
The **`alt.* hierarchy`** was a microcosm of the early internet’s unregulated, chaotic, and diverse nature.

Its most famous and infamous [[newsgroups]] played a significant role in shaping early online culture, setting the stage for how communities, subcultures, and controversies would evolve in the internet age.
