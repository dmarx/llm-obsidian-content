notable confidence schemes


**ASSISTANT**

Confidence schemes, also known as cons or scams, are deceitful plots used by con artists to swindle individuals or groups by gaining their trust. Here are some of the most notable confidence schemes in history:

### 1. **Ponzi Scheme**
Named after [[Charles Ponzi]], this scheme promises high returns with little risk to investors. Early investors are paid returns from the investments of new participants rather than from profit earned by the operation. The scheme collapses when the operator can no longer attract new investors or when a large number of investors cash out simultaneously.

### 2. **Pyramid Scheme**
Similar to a Ponzi scheme, in a pyramid scheme, participants recruit others to invest, and those recruits must in turn recruit more participants. Each level of the pyramid pays the level above it. The scheme is unsustainable as it requires exponential growth and collapses when there are not enough new recruits.

### 3. **Advance-Fee Scam**
Victims are persuaded to pay money upfront for a promise of a larger sum of money, product, or service that never materializes. A classic example is the "Nigerian Prince" scam, where the scammer claims to need help transferring large amounts of money out of their country and offers the victim a significant percentage in return for their help.

### 4. **Boiler Room Scam**
This involves high-pressure sales tactics, typically via telephone, to sell worthless or non-existent stocks, commodities, or other investments. The term "boiler room" comes from the high-pressure, high-volume environment in which these operations typically take place.

### 5. **Romance Scam**
Scammers create fake profiles on dating sites or social media to establish a romantic relationship with the victim. Once trust is built, the scammer asks for money under various pretexts, such as medical emergencies or travel expenses to visit the victim.

### 6. **Lottery Scam**
Victims are informed that they have won a lottery or sweepstakes they never entered. To claim the prize, they are instructed to pay fees or taxes upfront. Once the payment is made, the scammer disappears, and no prize is delivered.

### 7. **Phishing**
This involves fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details by disguising as a trustworthy entity in electronic communications. Phishing is often carried out through email or by creating fake websites that mimic legitimate ones.

### 8. **Bank Examiner Scam**
A con artist poses as a bank examiner or law enforcement official and convinces the victim to withdraw money from their account to help catch a supposed corrupt bank employee. The victim is instructed to hand over the money for "evidence," which the scammer then takes.

### 9. **Fake Check Scam**
The victim receives a check and is asked to deposit it and then wire a portion of the funds back to the scammer. The check is fake, but the victim does not realize this until after sending the money, leaving them responsible for the entire amount.

### 10. **Ransomware**
A type of malicious software designed to block access to a computer system until a sum of money is paid. Unlike other scams, this is more technical and involves infecting the victim's computer or network, often demanding payment in cryptocurrency.

### 11. **Wire Fraud**
A broad category that involves any scam carried out via telecommunications or the internet. Examples include investment frauds, online auction scams, and fraudulent schemes involving electronic transfers.

### 12. **Pig-in-a-Poke**
This is an old scam where a seller offers a bag supposedly containing a valuable animal (like a pig), but after the purchase, the buyer discovers the bag actually contains a worthless animal (like a cat). This term now metaphorically refers to any fraudulent transaction where the buyer is deceived about the nature or value of the purchase.

### 13. **Charity Scam**
Scammers pose as representatives of legitimate charities, particularly after natural disasters or during holiday seasons, soliciting donations that they then pocket.
