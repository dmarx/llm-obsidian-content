Prandtl-Meyer expansion fan

### Prandtl-Meyer Expansion Fan

The **Prandtl-Meyer expansion fan** is a key concept in [[compressible fluid dynamics]], particularly in the study of supersonic flows. It occurs when a supersonic flow undergoes an expansion around a convex corner or through a divergent passage, resulting in a smooth and continuous change in the flow properties. Unlike [[shock waves]], which compress the flow, a Prandtl-Meyer expansion fan causes the flow to expand, leading to a decrease in pressure, temperature, and density, while the flow velocity and Mach number increase.

### Characteristics of Prandtl-Meyer Expansion Fans

1. **Flow Expansion**:
   - The Prandtl-Meyer expansion fan causes the flow to expand as it turns around a convex corner. This expansion is isentropic, meaning it is both adiabatic (no heat exchange) and reversible, with no [[shock waves]] involved.

2. **Increase in Mach Number**:
   - As the flow expands through the Prandtl-Meyer fan, the Mach number increases. For instance, a supersonic flow entering the expansion fan with a Mach number \( M_1 \) will exit with a higher Mach number \( M_2 \).

3. **Decrease in Pressure, Temperature, and Density**:
   - The expansion leads to a decrease in pressure, temperature, and density of the fluid. The expansion process is smooth and continuous, with all changes occurring gradually over the region of the expansion fan.

4. **Fan of Expansion Waves**:
   - The Prandtl-Meyer expansion is not a single wave but a fan of infinitesimal expansion waves. Each wave corresponds to a small increment in the flow turning angle and Mach number. The overall expansion is the cumulative effect of these waves.

### Prandtl-Meyer Function

The behavior of the Prandtl-Meyer expansion can be described using the **Prandtl-Meyer function** \( \nu(M) \), which relates the Mach number \( M \) to the flow turning angle \( \theta \).

The Prandtl-Meyer function for a perfect gas is given by:

$$
\nu(M) = \sqrt{\frac{\gamma + 1}{\gamma - 1}} \tan^{-1}\left(\sqrt{\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma + 1}(M^2 - 1)}\right) - \tan^{-1}\left(\sqrt{M^2 - 1}\right),
$$

where:
- \( \nu(M) \) is the Prandtl-Meyer function (in radians or degrees),
- \( M \) is the Mach number of the flow,
- \( \gamma \) is the [[adiabatic index]], which is the ratio of specific heats (\( c_p / c_v \)).

### Expansion Process

1. **Initial Conditions**:
   - The flow begins with a Mach number \( M_1 \) and a flow direction parallel to a wall or surface.

2. **Flow Turning**:
   - When the flow encounters a convex corner (such as at the trailing edge of a wedge or around a corner), it turns by an angle \( \theta \).

3. **Prandtl-Meyer Angle**:
   - The Prandtl-Meyer angle \( \nu(M) \) increases as the flow turns. The total turning angle \( \theta \) is related to the Mach numbers before and after the expansion by the difference in Prandtl-Meyer functions:
     $$
     \Delta \nu = \nu(M_2) - \nu(M_1) = \theta,
     $$
     where \( M_2 \) is the Mach number after the expansion.

4. **Final Conditions**:
   - After passing through the expansion fan, the flow exits with a new Mach number \( M_2 \), and the corresponding pressure, temperature, and density are lower than those before the expansion.

### Key Relationships

Given the Mach number before the expansion \( M_1 \) and the turning angle \( \theta \), the Mach number after the expansion \( M_2 \) can be found by solving:

$$
\nu(M_2) = \nu(M_1) + \theta.
$$

Once \( M_2 \) is determined, the following relations can be used to find the changes in pressure, temperature, and density:

1. **Pressure Ratio**:
   $$
   \frac{p_2}{p_1} = \left(\frac{1 + \frac{\gamma - 1}{2} M_1^2}{1 + \frac{\gamma - 1}{2} M_2^2}\right)^{\frac{\gamma}{\gamma - 1}},
   $$

2. **Temperature Ratio**:
   $$
   \frac{T_2}{T_1} = \frac{1 + \frac{\gamma - 1}{2} M_1^2}{1 + \frac{\gamma - 1}{2} M_2^2},
   $$

3. **Density Ratio**:
   $$
   \frac{\rho_2}{\rho_1} = \left(\frac{p_2}{p_1}\right) \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right).
   $$

### Examples and Applications

1. **Supersonic and Hypersonic Aerodynamics**:
   - Prandtl-Meyer expansion fans are fundamental in the design of supersonic and hypersonic airfoils and wings. The expansion fan allows the flow to turn around sharp edges without forming [[shock waves]], reducing drag and thermal loads on the vehicle.

2. **Rocket Nozzles**:
   - In rocket nozzles, especially those designed for supersonic exhaust flows, the nozzle shape is designed to create Prandtl-Meyer expansions that efficiently convert thermal energy into kinetic energy, maximizing thrust.

3. **Wind Tunnel Testing**:
   - Wind tunnels used to test supersonic vehicles often incorporate models or geometries that create Prandtl-Meyer expansion fans, allowing researchers to study the behavior of the flow and validate theoretical predictions.

4. **Explosions and Blast Waves**:
   - In the study of explosions, Prandtl-Meyer expansions are observed in the rarefaction waves that follow an initial shock wave, where the high-pressure gases expand into the surrounding medium.

### Visualization and Analysis

1. **Flow Visualization**:
   - Prandtl-Meyer expansion fans can be visualized using techniques such as schlieren photography, which captures the changes in density gradients as the flow expands. This allows engineers to observe the smooth, fan-like structure of the expansion.

2. **Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)**:
   - CFD simulations are commonly used to model Prandtl-Meyer expansions, providing detailed insights into how the flow properties change through the expansion fan. These simulations help optimize the design of aerodynamic surfaces and nozzles.

### Conclusion

The **Prandtl-Meyer expansion fan** is a critical concept in the study of [[compressible fluid dynamics]], especially in supersonic and hypersonic flows. It describes the smooth, isentropic expansion that occurs when a supersonic flow turns around a convex corner or diverging passage. The resulting increase in Mach number and decrease in pressure, temperature, and density are important in the design and analysis of high-speed vehicles, nozzles, and other aerodynamic systems. Understanding and applying the principles of Prandtl-Meyer expansion fans is essential for optimizing the performance of systems operating in supersonic and hypersonic regimes.
