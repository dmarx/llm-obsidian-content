### Voting Systems

Voting systems, also known as electoral systems, are methods for aggregating individual preferences to make collective decisions. These systems play a crucial role in democracies, organizations, and various decision-making bodies by determining how votes are cast, counted, and translated into outcomes. Different voting systems have distinct properties, strengths, and weaknesses, and the choice of system can significantly influence the fairness, representation, and efficiency of the decision-making process.

### Key Concepts

1. **Preference Aggregation**: The process of combining individual preferences to determine a collective decision.
2. **Majority Rule**: A fundamental principle where the option with more than half of the votes wins.
3. **Proportional Representation**: A principle where parties or candidates receive seats in proportion to the number of votes they receive.
4. **Fairness Criteria**: Properties such as non-dictatorship, unanimity, and independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) that are used to evaluate the fairness of voting systems.

### Types of Voting Systems

#### 1. Plurality Voting

**Description**: Each voter selects one candidate, and the candidate with the most votes wins.

**Strengths**:
- Simple and easy to understand.
- Quick to implement and count votes.

**Weaknesses**:
- Can lead to the election of a candidate who does not have majority support.
- Susceptible to the [[spoiler effect]], where a minor candidate's participation changes the outcome.

**Example**: Most common in single-winner elections, such as the United States presidential election.

#### 2. Runoff Voting

**Description**: If no candidate receives a majority of votes in the first round, a runoff is held between the top two candidates.

**Strengths**:
- Ensures the winner has majority support.
- Reduces the impact of the [[spoiler effect]].

**Weaknesses**:
- Requires multiple rounds of voting, which can be costly and time-consuming.

**Example**: Used in presidential elections in countries like France and some U.S. states for primaries.

#### 3. Ranked Choice Voting (Instant Runoff Voting)

**Description**: Voters rank candidates in order of preference. If no candidate receives a majority of first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and their votes are redistributed until one candidate has a majority.

**Strengths**:
- Ensures majority support.
- Reduces negative campaigning, as candidates seek second and third-choice votes.
- Mitigates the [[spoiler effect]].

**Weaknesses**:
- More complex to implement and understand.
- Requires more sophisticated vote counting.

**Example**: Used in Australian House of Representatives elections and some U.S. municipal elections.

#### 4. Borda Count

**Description**: Voters rank candidates, and points are assigned based on the position in the ranking (e.g., 1 point for last place, 2 points for second last, etc.). The candidate with the highest total points wins.

**Strengths**:
- Takes into account the full spectrum of voter preferences.
- Encourages candidates to appeal to a broader electorate.

**Weaknesses**:
- Can be manipulated by [[strategic voting]].
- Does not necessarily select the candidate with the majority of first-choice votes.

**Example**: Used in some university and organizational elections.

#### 5. Single Transferable Vote (STV)

**Description**: A proportional representation system where voters rank candidates. Candidates are elected in multi-member districts based on achieving a quota of votes. Surplus votes are transferred to other candidates based on voter preferences.

**Strengths**:
- Ensures proportional representation.
- Reduces wasted votes.
- Reflects the preferences of a larger portion of the electorate.

**Weaknesses**:
- Complex to understand and count.
- Can lead to longer ballot papers and counting processes.

**Example**: Used in Ireland's parliamentary elections and some Australian elections.

#### 6. Approval Voting

**Description**: Voters can vote for (approve) as many candidates as they like. The candidate with the most approvals wins.

**Strengths**:
- Simple to implement and understand.
- Reduces the impact of the [[spoiler effect]].
- Encourages candidates to appeal to a wider audience.

**Weaknesses**:
- Does not ensure proportional representation.
- Can lead to the election of compromise candidates who are not the first choice of many voters.

**Example**: Used in some professional and academic societies for elections.

#### 7. Proportional Representation (PR)

**Description**: Seats are allocated to parties or candidates in proportion to the number of votes received. There are various methods to implement PR, such as party-list PR and mixed-member proportional representation (MMP).

**Strengths**:
- Ensures that parties receive representation in proportion to their support.
- Reduces the likelihood of a dominant party.

**Weaknesses**:
- Can lead to fragmented parliaments and coalition governments.
- More complex to implement and understand.

**Example**: Used in many European countries, such as Germany and Sweden.

### Fairness Criteria

#### 1. Arrow's Impossibility Theorem

Arrow's Impossibility Theorem demonstrates that no voting system can simultaneously satisfy all of the following fairness criteria for three or more candidates:

- **Unrestricted Domain (Universality)**: The system can handle any set of individual preferences.
- **Non-Dictatorship**: No single voter can dictate the outcome.
- **Pareto Efficiency (Unanimity)**: If every voter prefers one option over another, the system should reflect that preference.
- **Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA)**: The ranking of any two alternatives should not be affected by changes in the ranking of other alternatives.

#### 2. Condorcet Criterion

A voting system satisfies the Condorcet criterion if it always selects the Condorcet winner, the candidate who would win a head-to-head competition against each of the other candidates.

**Example**: The Condorcet method is used to identify the candidate who can win against all others in pairwise comparisons.

#### 3. Majority Criterion

A voting system satisfies the majority criterion if it always selects the candidate who receives more than half of the first-choice votes.

**Example**: Plurality voting satisfies the majority criterion when there are only two candidates.

### Conclusion

Voting systems are essential for aggregating individual preferences into collective decisions. Each system has its strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of system can significantly impact the fairness, representation, and efficiency of the decision-making process. Understanding the various voting systems and their properties helps in designing mechanisms that best suit the specific context and objectives of the election or decision-making process.
