### Tetralemma (Catuṣkoṭi)

The tetralemma, or $catuṣkoṭi$ (Sanskrit: चतुष्कोटि), is a logical framework used extensively in [[Madhyamaka|Madhyamaka philosophy]] by [[Nāgārjuna]]. It systematically explores four possible logical positions regarding any given proposition, particularly to refute inherent existence and illustrate the concept of [[[[śūnyatā]]|emptiness]].

#### The Four Alternatives

1. **Affirmation (P is true)**:
   - This position asserts the truth of the proposition $P$.

2. **Negation (P is false)**:
   - This position asserts the falsehood of the proposition $P$.

3. **Both (P is both true and false)**:
   - This position asserts that $P$ is simultaneously true and false.

4. **Neither (P is neither true nor false)**:
   - This position asserts that $P$ is neither true nor false.

#### Purpose and Application

The tetralemma is used to demonstrate the limitations of conventional binary logic and to reveal the emptiness of all conceptual constructs. Nāgārjuna employs this framework to challenge the inherent existence of phenomena by showing that none of the four positions can adequately describe the true nature of reality.

### Example: Analyzing the Existence of the Self

Consider the proposition $P$: "The self exists inherently."

1. **Affirmation (The self exists inherently)**:
   - This is the common belief that there is a permanent, unchanging self.

2. **Negation (The self does not exist inherently)**:
   - This position denies the existence of a permanent self, suggesting that the self is merely an aggregate of impermanent phenomena.

3. **Both (The self both exists and does not exist inherently)**:
   - This paradoxical position combines the first two, suggesting a self that somehow both exists and does not exist in an inherent way.

4. **Neither (The self neither exists nor does not exist inherently)**:
   - This position goes beyond the dichotomy, asserting that the conceptual framework of existence and non-existence is inadequate to describe the self's true nature.

### Mathematical Analogies

While the tetralemma is a philosophical tool, some mathematical analogies can help illustrate its principles:

1. **Set Theory**:
   - Consider a set $S$ and a property $A$. The tetralemma can be explored through the membership of elements in $S$ with respect to $A$:
     1. $S \subseteq A$: All elements of $S$ have property $A$.
     2. $S \subseteq \neg A$: All elements of $S$ do not have property $A$.
     3. $S \cap A \neq \emptyset \text{ and } S \cap \neg A \neq \emptyset$: Some elements of $S$ have property $A$, and some do not.
     4. $S \cap (A \cup \neg A) = \emptyset$: None of the elements of $S$ can be described by property $A$ or its negation.

2. **Quantum Mechanics**:
   - In quantum mechanics, the principle of superposition can be related to the third position of the tetralemma (both). For example, a quantum particle can exist in a superposition of states, being in multiple states simultaneously until measured.
   - The fourth position (neither) can be related to the concept of quantum indeterminacy, where the state of a system is not determined until observation, suggesting a reality beyond classical binary logic.

3. **Logical Paradoxes**:
   - The tetralemma resembles logical paradoxes such as the Liar Paradox, where a statement refers to itself in a way that creates a contradiction:
     - "This statement is false." If the statement is true, then it must be false, and if it is false, then it must be true. This challenges binary logic, similar to the way the tetralemma challenges conceptual categories.

### Application in Madhyamaka Philosophy

#### Deconstructing Conceptual Extremes

Nāgārjuna uses the tetralemma to deconstruct extreme views and to show that reality cannot be captured by conventional categories. By refuting the inherent existence of phenomena through the tetralemma, he demonstrates that:

1. **Phenomena are not inherently existent** because they depend on causes and conditions (dependent origination).
2. **Phenomena are not inherently non-existent** because they function and manifest in the world.
3. **Phenomena cannot be both existent and non-existent inherently** because this would lead to logical contradictions.
4. **Phenomena cannot be neither existent nor non-existent inherently** because this negates any meaningful discussion about their nature.

### Conclusion

The tetralemma is a powerful tool in Madhyamaka philosophy, used to expose the limitations of binary and conceptual thinking. It reveals the emptiness of all phenomena, illustrating that they cannot be adequately described by conventional logical categories. By deconstructing inherent existence through the tetralemma, Nāgārjuna guides practitioners toward a deeper understanding of reality, free from conceptual extremes and closer to the true nature of emptiness.
