## The American Dream Narrative as a Hierarchy-Enhancing Myth

### Introduction

The **American Dream** is a foundational narrative in American culture, encapsulating the belief that anyone, regardless of their background, can achieve success and upward mobility through hard work, determination, and talent. While this narrative is often seen as inspiring and aspirational, it also functions as a hierarchy-enhancing myth by justifying and perpetuating social inequalities. In the context of [[Social Dominance Theory]] (SDT), the American Dream narrative serves to legitimize existing social hierarchies and maintain the status quo.

### Core Tenets of the American Dream

1. **Equal Opportunity**: The belief that everyone has the same chance to succeed if they work hard enough.
2. **Meritocracy**: The idea that success is based on individual merit, including talent, effort, and achievement.
3. **Self-Made Success**: The notion that individuals can rise from humble beginnings to achieve great wealth and status through their own efforts.

### Mechanisms of Hierarchy Enhancement

#### Justification of Inequality

The American Dream narrative justifies social inequality by attributing success and failure to individual effort and ability. It suggests that those who are successful have earned their position through hard work, while those who are not successful have failed to do so. This perspective minimizes the role of structural factors such as systemic discrimination, unequal access to resources, and inherited wealth.

- **Example**: The narrative often highlights "rags-to-riches" stories of individuals who have overcome significant obstacles to achieve great success, reinforcing the idea that anyone can succeed if they try hard enough.

#### Perpetuation of Meritocracy

By emphasizing meritocracy, the American Dream narrative supports the idea that social hierarchies are fair and just. It promotes the belief that higher-status individuals and groups are inherently more talented or hardworking, thus deserving their elevated positions.

- **Example**: In educational and professional settings, the American Dream narrative can lead to the perception that those who excel are simply more deserving, ignoring factors like unequal access to quality education and professional networks.

#### Distraction from Structural Barriers

The focus on individual achievement distracts from the structural barriers that impede social mobility for marginalized groups. It discourages collective action to address these barriers by framing inequality as a matter of personal responsibility rather than systemic injustice.

- **Example**: Policy debates often invoke the American Dream to argue against welfare programs and affirmative action, suggesting that such measures are unnecessary if individuals are simply motivated to work hard.

### Empirical Evidence

#### Endorsement of Hierarchy-Enhancing Myths

Research indicates that individuals who strongly endorse the American Dream narrative are more likely to support hierarchy-enhancing ideologies and policies. These individuals are less likely to recognize the impact of systemic inequalities and more likely to attribute poverty and failure to personal shortcomings.

- **Study Findings**: Studies have shown that belief in the American Dream is correlated with opposition to social welfare programs and affirmative action, as well as with negative attitudes toward marginalized groups who are perceived as not trying hard enough to succeed.

#### Impact on Social and Political Attitudes

The American Dream narrative shapes social and political attitudes by reinforcing beliefs in individualism and personal responsibility. It influences public opinion on issues related to economic inequality, social justice, and government intervention.

- **Political Implications**: Politicians and policymakers often invoke the American Dream to justify policies that reduce social safety nets and deregulate markets, arguing that such measures will incentivize hard work and personal responsibility.

### Criticisms and Limitations

#### Overemphasis on Individual Effort

Critics argue that the American Dream narrative places too much emphasis on individual effort while ignoring systemic barriers. It fails to account for the significant impact of factors such as racial discrimination, economic inequality, and lack of access to quality education and healthcare.

- **Example**: Despite high levels of hard work and determination, many individuals from marginalized groups remain unable to achieve upward mobility due to persistent structural disadvantages.

#### Cultural and Societal Variability

The American Dream narrative is specific to American culture and may not be applicable or effective in other cultural contexts where collective effort and social support are more highly valued.

- **Example**: In countries with strong social welfare systems and a greater emphasis on collective responsibility, narratives similar to the American Dream are less prevalent and less influential.

### Conclusion

The American Dream narrative, while inspirational for many, functions as a hierarchy-enhancing myth by justifying social inequalities and maintaining the status quo. By emphasizing individual effort and meritocracy, it obscures the role of systemic barriers and discourages collective action to address social injustices. Understanding the American Dream as a hierarchy-enhancing myth provides valuable insights into the ideological mechanisms that perpetuate social hierarchies and highlights the need for more inclusive and equitable narratives.
