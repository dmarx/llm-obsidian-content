Point-Biserial Correlation


**ASSISTANT**

The point-biserial correlation is a statistical measure used to assess the relationship between a binary variable (e.g., a correct or incorrect answer to an item) and a continuous variable (e.g., the total test score). It is commonly used in the context of educational and psychological testing to evaluate the performance of individual test items.

## Formula and Interpretation

The point-biserial correlation coefficient (\( r_{pb} \)) is calculated as follows:

$$
r_{pb} = \frac{\overline{X}_1 - \overline{X}_0}{s_X} \sqrt{\frac{pq}{n}}
$$

where:
- \( \overline{X}_1 \) = mean total score for students who answered the item correctly
- \( \overline{X}_0 \) = mean total score for students who answered the item incorrectly
- \( s_X \) = standard deviation of the total test scores
- \( p \) = proportion of students who answered the item correctly
- \( q \) = proportion of students who answered the item incorrectly (\( q = 1 - p \))
- \( n \) = total number of students

### Steps to Calculate Point-Biserial Correlation

1. **Calculate Mean Scores**:
   - Compute the mean total score (\( \overline{X}_1 \)) for students who answered the item correctly.
   - Compute the mean total score (\( \overline{X}_0 \)) for students who answered the item incorrectly.

2. **Calculate Standard Deviation**:
   - Compute the standard deviation (\( s_X \)) of the total test scores.

3. **Calculate Proportions**:
   - Determine the proportion of students who answered the item correctly (\( p \)).
   - Calculate the proportion of students who answered the item incorrectly (\( q = 1 - p \)).

4. **Apply the Formula**:
   - Substitute the calculated values into the point-biserial correlation formula to find \( r_{pb} \).

### Interpretation

- **Positive \( r_{pb} \)**: A positive point-biserial correlation indicates that students who answered the item correctly tended to have higher overall test scores. This suggests that the item is functioning well in discriminating between higher- and lower-performing students.
- **Negative \( r_{pb} \)**: A negative point-biserial correlation suggests that students who answered the item correctly tended to have lower overall test scores, which may indicate an issue with the item (e.g., it could be misleading or testing irrelevant knowledge).
- **Magnitude**: The closer the value of \( r_{pb} \) is to 1, the stronger the relationship between the item response and the total test score. Values closer to 0 indicate a weaker relationship.

## Example Calculation

Let's consider an example to illustrate the calculation of the point-biserial correlation.

### Given Data:
- Total number of students (\( n \)): 100
- Mean total score for students who answered the item correctly (\( \overline{X}_1 \)): 75
- Mean total score for students who answered the item incorrectly (\( \overline{X}_0 \)): 60
- Standard deviation of the total test scores (\( s_X \)): 10
- Proportion of students who answered the item correctly (\( p \)): 0.7
- Proportion of students who answered the item incorrectly (\( q \)): 0.3

### Calculation:

1. **Mean Scores**:
   - \( \overline{X}_1 = 75 \)
   - \( \overline{X}_0 = 60 \)

2. **Standard Deviation**:
   - \( s_X = 10 \)

3. **Proportions**:
   - \( p = 0.7 \)
   - \( q = 0.3 \)

4. **Point-Biserial Correlation**:
   $$
   r_{pb} = \frac{75 - 60}{10} \sqrt{\frac{0.7 \cdot 0.3}{100}} = \frac{15}{10} \sqrt{\frac{0.21}{100}} = 1.5 \sqrt{0.0021} = 1.5 \cdot 0.0458 \approx 0.069
   $$

In this example, the point-biserial correlation is approximately 0.069, indicating a weak positive relationship between the item response and the total test score. This suggests that the item is not very effective at discriminating between higher- and lower-performing students.

## Importance in Educational Assessment

The point-biserial correlation is an important tool for evaluating the quality of test items in educational assessments. By analyzing the point-biserial correlations of items, educators and test developers can:

- **Identify Discriminating Items**: Items with high positive point-biserial correlations are effective at distinguishing between students of different ability levels.
- **Improve Test Validity**: Ensuring that items correlate well with overall test performance helps in maintaining the validity of the test.
- **Detect Problematic Items**: Items with low or negative point-biserial correlations can be reviewed and revised or removed to improve the overall quality of the assessment.

In summary, the point-biserial correlation provides valuable insights into the performance of individual test items, helping to ensure that educational assessments are both reliable and valid. By carefully analyzing and interpreting point-biserial correlations, educators can enhance the effectiveness of their assessments in measuring student knowledge and abilities.
