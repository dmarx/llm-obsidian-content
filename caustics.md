# Caustics

Caustics are envelopes of light rays that have been reflected or refracted by a curved surface, forming regions of enhanced brightness, often with distinctive geometric patterns. The term comes from the Greek word "καυστικός" (kaustikos), meaning "burning," as these concentrated light patterns can sometimes generate enough heat to burn a surface. Caustics represent a fascinating intersection of [[optics]], [[differential geometry]], [[singularity theory]], and [[catastrophe theory]].

## Physical Principles

### Ray Optics Foundation

Caustics arise from the fundamental principles of [[geometric optics]]:

1. **[[Law of reflection]]**: Incident angle equals reflected angle
2. **[[Snell's law]]**: $n_1 \sin \theta_1 = n_2 \sin \theta_2$ for refraction
3. **[[Fermat's principle]]**: Light follows the path of stationary optical path length

When multiple light rays converge after reflection or refraction, they form caustic curves or surfaces where the light intensity theoretically becomes infinite.

### Wave Optics Perspective

From a [[wave optics]] viewpoint, caustics represent:

1. **[[Constructive interference]]**: Where wavefronts align in phase
2. **[[Diffraction effects]]**: Modifying the perfect geometric caustic
3. **[[Airy function]]**: Describing intensity near caustic boundaries

The intensity near a simple caustic follows an [[Airy function]] distribution:

$$I(s) \propto \text{Ai}^2\left(-\left(\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}\right)^{2/3}s\right)$$

Where $s$ is the distance from the geometric caustic and $\lambda$ is the wavelength.

## Mathematical Description

### Envelope Theory

A caustic can be defined as the [[envelope]] of a family of rays. For a family of curves $F(x,y,t) = 0$ parameterized by $t$, the envelope satisfies:

$$F(x,y,t) = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{\partial F}{\partial t}(x,y,t) = 0$$

### Lagrangian Singularities

From the perspective of [[singularity theory]], caustics are [[Lagrangian singularities]] - singularities of maps from a [[Lagrangian submanifold]] to configuration space.

A light ray can be represented as a point in [[phase space]] $(q,p)$ where $q$ is position and $p$ is momentum. The collection of all rays forms a Lagrangian submanifold $L$ in phase space, and the caustic is the singular set of the projection:

$$\pi: L \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$$

Where $\pi(q,p) = q$ is the projection onto position space.

### Catastrophe Theory Classification

[[René Thom]]'s [[catastrophe theory]] provides a powerful classification of stable caustics based on their [[codimension]]:

1. **[[Fold caustic]]** (Codimension 1): The simplest caustic, appearing as a curved line in 2D. Local normal form: $x^3 + ax$
2. **[[Cusp caustic]]** (Codimension 2): Where fold caustics meet, forming a pointed cusp. Normal form: $x^4 + ax^2 + bx$
3. **[[Swallowtail caustic]]** (Codimension 3): More complex structure with a tail-like appendage. Normal form: $x^5 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx$
4. **[[Butterfly caustic]]** (Codimension 4): Higher-order singularity. Normal form: $x^6 + ax^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx$
5. **[[Elliptic umbilic]]** (Codimension 3): Formed by refraction through spherical interfaces. Normal form: $x^3 - 3xy^2 + a(x^2+y^2) + bx + cy$
6. **[[Hyperbolic umbilic]]** (Codimension 3): Another 3D caustic pattern. Normal form: $x^3 + y^3 + axy + bx + cy$

## Natural Occurrences

### Underwater Caustics

One of the most familiar caustics appears as the shimmering patterns on the bottom of swimming pools:

1. **[[Network caustics]]**: Formed by refraction through a wavy water surface
2. **[[Time evolution]]**: Patterns change as water waves propagate
3. **[[Intensity distribution]]**: Bright regions alternate with darker areas

### Atmospheric Phenomena

Several atmospheric optical phenomena involve caustics:

1. **[[Rainbow]]**: Circular caustic formed by refraction and reflection in raindrops
2. **[[Glory]]**: Circular caustic seen opposite the sun when looking at mist or clouds
3. **[[Sun pillars]]**: Vertical caustics formed by reflection from ice crystals
4. **[[Sundogs]]** (parhelia): Caustics formed by refraction through hexagonal ice crystals

### Astronomical Caustics

In [[gravitational lensing]], massive objects bend light from distant sources:

1. **[[Einstein rings]]**: Perfect circular caustics from perfect alignment
2. **[[Fold and cusp arcs]]**: Typical caustic structures in gravitational lensing
3. **[[Microlensing events]]**: Temporary brightening as sources cross caustic networks

3. **[[Parabolic umbilic]]**: Transitional case between elliptic and hyperbolic

### Vector Field Singularities

Caustics are related to singularities in the [[gradient vector field]] of the [[eikonal equation]]:

$$|\nabla \phi|^2 = n^2(x)$$

Where $\phi$ is the optical phase and $n(x)$ is the refractive index.
