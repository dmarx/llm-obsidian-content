### Decomposition Models in Forecasting and Time Series Analysis

Decomposition models are a fundamental approach in time series analysis and forecasting that break down a time series into several underlying components, typically including trend, seasonality, and residuals. This method helps to understand the underlying patterns in the data and improve the accuracy of forecasts.

#### Key Components

1. **Trend (T_t)**: The long-term progression of the series, representing the general direction over time (upward, downward, or constant).
2. **Seasonality (S_t)**: Regular, repeating patterns or cycles in the series that occur at the same period every cycle (e.g., monthly, quarterly, annually).
3. **Residuals (R_t)**: The random fluctuations or noise in the data that are not explained by the trend or seasonality.

#### Decomposition Models

Decomposition models can be either additive or multiplicative, depending on how the components interact.

##### Additive Model

In an additive model, the components are summed:
$$
Y_t = T_t + S_t + R_t
$$
where \(Y_t\) is the observed value at time \(t\).

##### Multiplicative Model

In a multiplicative model, the components are multiplied:
$$
Y_t = T_t \times S_t \times R_t
$$
Multiplicative models are useful when the seasonal variations change proportionally with the trend.

#### Steps in Decomposition

1. **Identify the Components**:
   - **Trend**: Can be identified using methods like moving averages or regression.
   - **Seasonality**: Can be identified by calculating average seasonal effects over multiple cycles.
   - **Residuals**: The remainder after removing trend and seasonality from the series.

2. **Estimate the Components**:
   - **Trend Estimation**: Apply a smoothing technique like moving average or fit a regression line.
   - **Seasonal Estimation**: Calculate the average seasonal effect for each period in the cycle.
   - **Residual Estimation**: Subtract the estimated trend and seasonal components from the original series.

3. **Construct the Model**:
   - **Additive**: Combine the estimated components additively.
   - **Multiplicative**: Combine the estimated components multiplicatively.

4. **Forecasting**:
   - Use the identified components to make future forecasts by extending the trend and applying the seasonal pattern.

#### Example: Additive Decomposition

Suppose we have monthly sales data for a product over two years, and we want to decompose it using an additive model.

**Step-by-Step Solution**:

1. **Plot the Data**:
   - Visualize the time series to identify the presence of trend and seasonality.

2. **Estimate the Trend**:
   - Use a moving average with a period equal to the seasonal cycle (e.g., 12 months) to smooth out the seasonal effect.
   - Calculate the moving average:
     $$
     \text{MA}_t = \frac{Y_{t-5} + Y_{t-4} + \cdots + Y_{t} + \cdots + Y_{t+4} + Y_{t+5}}{12}
     $$

3. **Estimate the Seasonality**:
   - Calculate the seasonal indices by averaging the detrended values (original data - trend) for each month.
   - Seasonal index for month \(i\):
     $$
     S_i = \frac{\sum_{\text{months of year } i} (Y_t - T_t)}{\text{number of years}}
     $$

4. **Estimate the Residuals**:
   - Subtract the estimated trend and seasonal components from the original series:
     $$
     R_t = Y_t - T_t - S_t
     $$

5. **Forecasting**:
   - Extend the trend component into the future.
   - Apply the seasonal indices to the extended trend to forecast future values.

**Example Calculation**:

Assume the following monthly sales data:

| Month | Year 1 | Year 2 |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Jan   | 120    | 130    |
| Feb   | 135    | 140    |
| Mar   | 150    | 160    |
| Apr   | 170    | 180    |
| May   | 160    | 170    |
| Jun   | 180    | 190    |
| Jul   | 200    | 210    |
| Aug   | 190    | 200    |
| Sep   | 210    | 220    |
| Oct   | 230    | 240    |
| Nov   | 220    | 230    |
| Dec   | 250    | 260    |

- **Estimate Trend**: Using a 12-month moving average for simplicity, let's say the trend component \( T_t \) for each month is the average of the sales values.
- **Seasonal Component**: Calculate the average deviation of each month from the trend over two years. For instance, if the January deviations are -10 and 0, the seasonal index for January is:
  $$
  S_{\text{Jan}} = \frac{(-10 + 0)}{2} = -5
  $$
- **Residuals**: Calculate the residuals for each month by subtracting the trend and seasonal components from the actual sales.

##### Multiplicative Decomposition

For the multiplicative model, the process is similar but involves division instead of subtraction for detrending and deseasonalizing the data.

**Steps**:

1. **Plot the Data**: Visualize the time series.
2. **Estimate the Trend**: Use a moving average or regression.
3. **Estimate the Seasonality**: Calculate the seasonal indices by averaging the ratios (original data / trend) for each period.
4. **Estimate the Residuals**: Divide the original series by the estimated trend and seasonal components.
5. **Forecasting**: Extend the trend and apply seasonal indices multiplicatively.

**Example Calculation**:

Using the same sales data:

- **Estimate Trend**: Calculate moving averages.
- **Seasonal Component**: Calculate the average ratio of each month to the trend.
- **Residuals**: Calculate residuals by dividing the actual sales by the trend and seasonal components.

#### Applications of Decomposition Models

1. **Business and Economics**: Forecasting sales, revenue, and economic indicators.
2. **Retail**: Planning inventory and promotions based on seasonal demand.
3. **Healthcare**: Predicting patient volumes and resource needs.
4. **Energy**: Forecasting electricity demand and optimizing supply.
5. **Finance**: Analyzing and forecasting stock prices and market trends.

#### Conclusion

Decomposition models are powerful tools in time series analysis and forecasting, enabling analysts to understand and predict complex patterns in data by breaking it down into trend, seasonality, and residual components. By applying additive or multiplicative models, businesses can make informed decisions and develop effective strategies to meet future demand.
