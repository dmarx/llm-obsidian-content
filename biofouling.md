Biofouling


**ASSISTANT**

**Biofouling** refers to the accumulation of biological materials—such as bacteria, algae, and small marine organisms—on surfaces submerged in water. In the context of microplastics, biofouling plays a crucial role in the **vertical transfer** of plastics in marine environments by increasing their effective density and, in some cases, causing otherwise buoyant plastic particles to sink.

### Mechanisms of Biofouling on Plastics

Biofouling on plastic debris occurs in several stages:

1. **Microbial Colonization**:
   - The process begins with the attachment of microorganisms, primarily **bacteria** and **algae**, to the surface of plastic particles. This forms a **biofilm**, which is a thin layer of microbial cells embedded in extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). 
   - This initial layer of microorganisms, known as a **conditioning layer**, forms rapidly, often within hours of the plastic being exposed to seawater.

2. **Growth of Complex Biofilms**:
   - As biofilm development progresses, more complex organisms, such as **diatoms** (a type of algae) and **protozoa**, colonize the plastic surface. These organisms further increase the mass and surface area of the biofilm, leading to denser aggregates.
   - Over time, the biofilm matures into a stable, multi-layered structure that significantly alters the physical properties of the plastic particle.

3. **Attachment of Larger Organisms**:
   - In some cases, **macrofouling** occurs, where larger organisms like **barnacles**, **mussels**, and **tube worms** attach themselves to the biofilm. This macrofouling is more common on larger pieces of plastic (macroplastics), but smaller plastic fragments can still carry biofilm with significant biological mass.
   
### Biofouling and Vertical Transport of Microplastics

The key effect of biofouling on plastics is the alteration of their **buoyancy**. Initially, most plastics are buoyant in seawater, especially lighter polymers like polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP), which are common in marine debris. However, as biofouling increases:

- **Increased Density**: The accumulation of biological material on the surface of the plastic increases its effective density. Once the density of the biofouled plastic exceeds that of seawater, the plastic particle begins to sink.
- **Sinking into the Deep Ocean**: Biofouled plastics sink through the water column, where they may eventually settle on the seafloor. This process plays a significant role in the **vertical transfer** of plastic debris from the surface, including regions like the [[North Pacific Garbage Patch]], to deeper ocean layers.

Mathematically, the sinking behavior of biofouled particles can be described using **Stokes' Law**, as mentioned previously:
$$
v_s = \frac{2r^2 (\rho_b - \rho_w) g}{9 \eta}
$$
Where:
- $v_s$ is the sinking velocity of the particle,
- $r$ is the radius of the biofouled plastic particle,
- $\rho_b$ is the effective density of the biofouled particle,
- $\rho_w$ is the density of seawater,
- $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity,
- $\eta$ is the dynamic viscosity of seawater.

As biofouling progresses, **$\rho_b$** increases due to the biological growth, resulting in a higher sinking velocity **$v_s$**.

### Impacts of Biofouling on Marine Plastic Pollution

Biofouling has several important implications for the behavior of plastics in marine ecosystems:

1. **Altered Distribution of Plastics**:
   - Biofouling facilitates the transfer of plastic debris from the ocean surface to deeper waters and eventually the seafloor. This helps explain why a significant portion of the **missing plastic** from surface waters is thought to have settled in deeper ocean layers.

2. **Interaction with Marine Organisms**:
   - Plastics colonized by biofilms can be mistaken for food by marine organisms, both at the surface and in deeper waters. This can lead to the ingestion of plastics by fish, invertebrates, and zooplankton, introducing plastics and potentially harmful chemicals into the marine food web.
   - Biofilms can also serve as a vector for the transport of **pathogens** and **invasive species**, which may hitchhike on floating plastics and disperse across oceans.

3. **Changes in Plastic Degradation Rates**:
   - Biofouling can either accelerate or slow down the degradation of plastics. The biofilm may protect the plastic from UV radiation, reducing **photodegradation** at the surface, while biological activity (e.g., **microbial degradation**) could break down the plastic more rapidly, especially in deeper waters where physical processes like UV degradation are not active.

4. **Marine Snow and Ballasting**:
   - Biofouled microplastics often become incorporated into **marine snow**—organic matter that sinks through the water column. This process is a key mechanism by which microplastics are transferred vertically in the ocean and is a form of **ballasting**, as the biofilm aggregates increase the overall density of the particles.

### Role of Biofouling in the Global Plastic Cycle

Biofouling is a fundamental process in the **global plastic cycle**, influencing the redistribution of plastic debris throughout the marine environment. By facilitating the sinking of plastics, biofouling contributes to the **plastic fallout** in deep-sea sediments, where plastics accumulate far from their original sources.

Moreover, the long-term ecological impacts of biofouled plastics in the deep sea are still being studied, particularly their interaction with benthic organisms and the potential for plastics to persist for centuries in deep-ocean ecosystems.
