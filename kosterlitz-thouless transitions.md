Kosterlitz-Thouless Transitions


**ASSISTANT**

The Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) transition is a paradigmatic example of a topological phase transition, occurring in two-dimensional (2D) systems. It was first described by J. Michael Kosterlitz and David J. Thouless in the early 1970s. This transition is characterized by the binding and unbinding of vortex-antivortex pairs in 2D systems, such as thin superfluid films, 2D XY model in magnetism, and two-dimensional superconductors. The KT transition demonstrates that long-range order is not necessary for phase coherence and that topological defects can drive phase transitions.

### Nature of the KT Transition

- **Vortices and Antivortices**: In the context of the KT transition, a vortex is a point defect in a 2D system around which the phase of the order parameter (e.g., the angle of spins in the XY model or the phase of the wave function in a superfluid) winds by \(2\pi\). An antivortex has an opposite winding, causing a \(2\pi\) decrease in the phase. Vortices and antivortices have associated kinetic energy and interact logarithmically over distance.

- **Binding and Unbinding**: At low temperatures, vortices and antivortices are tightly bound in pairs, minimizing the system's free energy. As the temperature increases, thermal fluctuations provide enough energy to break pairs apart at the KT transition temperature, leading to the proliferation of free vortices and antivortices. This unbinding disrupts the phase coherence over long distances, leading to a transition from a quasi-long-range ordered phase to a disordered phase.

### Characteristics of the KT Transition

- **Absence of Long-Range Order**: Below the KT transition temperature, the system exhibits quasi-long-range order characterized by algebraic decay of correlations, as opposed to the exponential decay seen in truly disordered phases.
  
- **Infinite Order Transition**: The KT transition is an infinite-order phase transition, meaning there is no discontinuity in any finite derivative of the free energy with respect to temperature. Instead, physical quantities like correlation length and susceptibility exhibit exponential behavior near the transition.
  
- **Universal Jump in Stiffness**: One of the hallmark predictions of the KT theory is the universal jump in the superfluid density (or stiffness in the context of the XY model) at the transition temperature. This jump reflects the sudden change in the system's response to a twist in the boundary conditions and is independent of the details of the system.

### Experimental Observations and Applications

- **Superfluid Helium**: Thin films of superfluid \(^4\)He have shown evidence of the KT transition, particularly in the behavior of the superfluid density near the transition temperature.
  
- **Two-Dimensional Superconductors**: In ultra-thin superconducting films, the KT transition has been observed as a sharp drop in resistance, associated with the unbinding of vortex-antivortex pairs and the consequent loss of superconductivity.
  
- **2D Materials and Josephson Junction Arrays**: The principles of the KT transition have also been applied to understand phase transitions in newly discovered two-dimensional materials and arrays of Josephson junctions, demonstrating the wide applicability of Kosterlitz and Thouless's groundbreaking work.

The KT transition remains a profound concept in condensed matter physics, illustrating the importance of topological defects and collective excitations in determining the physical properties of low-dimensional systems. The work of Kosterlitz and Thouless on this transition was recognized with a half-share of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2016, underscoring its fundamental impact on our understanding of phase transitions and topological phases of matter.
