### Gambling Theory

**Gambling Theory** is a branch of probability theory and statistics that deals with the analysis of games of chance, optimal betting strategies, and risk management. This field explores various models of gambling processes, examining the conditions under which different strategies can lead to success or failure.

### Key Concepts

1. **Probability and Randomness**: Understanding the probabilistic nature of gambling games, where outcomes are uncertain and governed by random processes.
2. **Expected Value**: Calculating the average outcome of a game over many trials, helping to determine whether a game is favorable or unfavorable.
3. **Martingales**: Processes where the conditional expectation of future values, given the present and past values, equals the current value. Martingales model fair games where no strategy can systematically lead to a profit.

### Fundamental Results in Gambling Theory

#### 1. **Expected Value**

The expected value (EV) of a gamble is the average amount one can expect to win or lose per bet if the bet were repeated many times. For a discrete random variable \(X\) with possible outcomes \(x_i\) and corresponding probabilities \(p_i\):

$$
E[X] = \sum_i x_i p_i
$$

#### 2. **Law of Large Numbers**

The Law of Large Numbers states that as the number of trials in a random process increases, the average of the outcomes will converge to the expected value. This is crucial in gambling theory as it implies that in the long run, the results of a fair game will average out to the expected value.

#### 3. **Central Limit Theorem**

The Central Limit Theorem states that the distribution of the sum (or average) of a large number of independent, identically distributed random variables approaches a normal distribution, regardless of the original distribution of the variables. This helps in assessing the variability and risk associated with gambling outcomes.

### Martingale Strategies

Martingales are a fundamental concept in gambling theory, representing betting strategies where the expected value of the gambler's capital, conditional on the current and past values, remains unchanged.

#### Classic Martingale Strategy

The classic Martingale strategy involves doubling the bet after each loss with the aim of recovering all losses plus gaining a profit equal to the original bet when a win eventually occurs.

**Steps:**
1. Start with an initial bet \(B\).
2. If you win, keep the profit and bet \(B\) again.
3. If you lose, double your bet and continue.

**Analysis:**
- The strategy assumes infinite wealth and no betting limits.
- The probability of encountering a long sequence of losses increases exponentially, leading to the risk of ruin.
- The strategy can be unsustainable in practical scenarios due to finite wealth and betting limits.

#### Anti-Martingale Strategy

The Anti-Martingale strategy involves doubling the bet after a win and halving it after a loss. This strategy aims to maximize profits during winning streaks and minimize losses during losing streaks.

**Steps:**
1. Start with an initial bet \(B\).
2. If you win, double your bet.
3. If you lose, halve your bet (or return to the initial bet size).

**Analysis:**
- Less risky than the classic Martingale strategy.
- Takes advantage of winning streaks while controlling losses during losing streaks.

#### Kelly Criterion

The Kelly Criterion is an advanced betting strategy that aims to maximize the long-term growth rate of wealth by betting a fraction of the bankroll proportional to the edge.

**Formula:**
$$
f^* = \frac{bp - q}{b}
$$

where:
- \( f^* \) is the fraction of the bankroll to bet.
- \( b \) is the net odds received on the bet.
- \( p \) is the probability of winning.
- \( q = 1 - p \) is the probability of losing.

**Analysis:**
- Maximizes the expected logarithm of wealth, balancing risk and reward.
- Requires precise knowledge of probabilities and odds.

### Martingales and the Optional Stopping Theorem

The Optional Stopping Theorem (OST) is a key result in the theory of [[martingales]]. It states that under certain conditions, the expected value of a martingale at a stopping time is equal to its initial expected value. This theorem implies that no fair gambling strategy can change the expected value of a game by choosing a stopping time based on the past history of the process.

### Example: Fair Coin Tossing Game

Consider a fair coin tossing game where the gambler wins $1 for heads and loses $1 for tails. Let \( S_n \) be the gambler's total gain after \( n \) tosses.

1. **Martingale Property**: The process \(\{S_n\}\) is a martingale because:
   $$
   E[S_{n+1} \mid \mathcal{F}_n] = S_n.
   $$

2. **Martingale Strategy**: Using the classic Martingale strategy, the gambler doubles the bet after each loss.

**Steps:**
- Start with a bet of $1.
- If the first bet is a loss, bet $2 on the next round.
- Continue doubling the bet after each loss until a win occurs.

**Analysis:**
- The expected value remains zero due to the martingale property.
- The risk of ruin increases exponentially with the number of consecutive losses.
- Practical limitations such as finite wealth and betting limits make the strategy impractical.

### Risk of Ruin

The **Risk of Ruin** is the probability that a gambler will lose their entire bankroll. This concept is critical in assessing the viability of gambling strategies.

#### Calculating Risk of Ruin

For a gambler using a fixed fraction betting strategy, the risk of ruin \(R\) can be calculated using the formula:

$$
R = \left( \frac{q}{p} \right)^f
$$

where:
- \( p \) is the probability of winning.
- \( q \) is the probability of losing.
- \( f \) is the fraction of the bankroll bet on each game.

For a classic Martingale strategy, the risk of ruin becomes significant with a finite bankroll due to the exponential increase in bets after consecutive losses.

### Conclusion

Gambling theory provides a rigorous mathematical framework for analyzing and understanding various betting strategies and their implications. By leveraging concepts such as expected value, [[martingales]], and the Optional Stopping Theorem, it becomes possible to assess the fairness and risks associated with different gambling strategies. While strategies like the Martingale and Anti-Martingale offer theoretical insights, practical limitations such as finite wealth and betting limits make them challenging to implement successfully. The Kelly Criterion, with its focus on optimizing the growth rate of wealth, offers a more balanced approach, though it requires precise knowledge of probabilities and odds. Understanding these concepts is crucial for anyone interested in the mathematical analysis of gambling and risk management.
