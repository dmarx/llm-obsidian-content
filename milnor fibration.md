Milnor Fibration


**ASSISTANT**

**Milnor Fibration** is a fundamental concept in [[singularity theory]] and [[differential topology]], introduced by John Milnor. It provides a way to study the local behavior of complex hypersurface singularities by describing how the fibers of a smooth map vary near a singular point. This fibration captures the topology of the singularity and is particularly useful for understanding its structure and properties.

### Definition and Setup

Consider a complex polynomial function \( f: \mathbb{C}^{n+1} \to \mathbb{C} \) with an isolated singularity at the origin. That is, \( f(0) = 0 \) and the gradient \( \nabla f(0) = 0 \). The Milnor fibration of \( f \) around the singularity is given by the map:
$$
\phi: B_\epsilon^{2n+2} \setminus K \to S^1,
```
where:
- \( B_\epsilon^{2n+2} \) is a small closed ball of radius \(\epsilon\) centered at the origin in \(\mathbb{C}^{n+1}\).
- \( K = f^{-1}(0) \cap B_\epsilon^{2n+2} \) is the link of the singularity, which is a compact, smooth manifold of real dimension \(2n-1\).
- The map \(\phi\) is defined by:
  $$
  \phi(z) = \frac{f(z)}{|f(z)|}.
  ```

### Milnor Fibration Theorem

**Theorem (Milnor Fibration Theorem)**: For sufficiently small \(\epsilon > 0\) and any sufficiently small \(\delta > 0\) such that \(0 < \delta \ll \epsilon\), the map:
$$
\phi: B_\epsilon^{2n+2} \setminus K \to S^1
$$
defined by \(\phi(z) = \frac{f(z)}{|f(z)|}\) is a smooth fiber bundle projection.

### Properties

1. **Fibers**: The fibers of \(\phi\) are given by the preimages \(\phi^{-1}(\theta)\) for \(\theta \in S^1\). Each fiber is diffeomorphic to the Milnor fiber, which is an \(n\)-dimensional complex manifold with boundary.
2. **Milnor Fiber**: The Milnor fiber \( F_\theta \) is defined as:
   $$
   F_\theta = f^{-1}(\theta \delta) \cap B_\epsilon^{2n+2},
   $$
   where \( \theta \delta \) is a complex number with modulus \(\delta\) and argument \(\theta\).
3. **Monodromy**: The monodromy of the fibration describes how the fibers are glued together as one goes around the circle \( S^1 \). It is given by a diffeomorphism of the Milnor fiber.

### Example: A Simple Singularity

Consider the polynomial \( f(z_1, z_2) = z_1^2 + z_2^2 \) in \(\mathbb{C}^2\). The origin is an isolated singularity.

1. **Link of the Singularity**: The link \( K \) is given by:
   $$
   K = \{ (z_1, z_2) \in \mathbb{C}^2 \mid |z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2 = \epsilon^2, z_1^2 + z_2^2 = 0 \}.
   $$
   This can be seen as a circle \( S^1 \) in \(\mathbb{C}^2\).

2. **Fibration**: The map \(\phi\) is:
   $$
   \phi(z_1, z_2) = \frac{z_1^2 + z_2^2}{|z_1^2 + z_2^2|}.
   $$
   The fibers \(\phi^{-1}(\theta)\) are level sets of \( f \), intersected with the ball \( B_\epsilon^{4} \).

### Applications

1. **Singularity Theory**: Milnor fibrations are used to study the local topology of singularities, providing insights into the structure of complex hypersurfaces near critical points.
2. **Algebraic Geometry**: The fibration helps understand the behavior of polynomial maps and the topology of their level sets.
3. **Topology and Geometry**: Milnor fibrations relate to various topological invariants, such as the Milnor number, which measures the complexity of a singularity.
4. **Dynamical Systems**: Understanding the monodromy and the behavior of fibers can provide insights into the dynamics near singular points.

### Conclusion

The Milnor fibration is a powerful tool in [[singularity theory]] and [[differential topology]], providing a way to analyze and understand the local behavior of complex hypersurface singularities. By studying the fibers and their monodromy, mathematicians gain deep insights into the structure and properties of singularities. For further study, refer to [[Singularity Theory]], [[Differential Topology]], and [[Complex Geometry]].
