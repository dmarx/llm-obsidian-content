title: leverage from the hat matrix.

**USER**

leverage from the [[hat matrix]].


**ASSISTANT**

Leverage is an important concept in regression diagnostics, helping to identify observations in the data that have a significant influence on the estimated parameters of a regression model. Leverage is derived from the [[hat matrix]], which, as explained earlier, projects the observed values of the dependent variable into the space of fitted values. 

### Understanding the Hat Matrix

The [[hat matrix]] \(H\), defined by the equation:

$$
H = X(X^T X)^{-1} X^T
$$

where \(X\) is the matrix of independent variables (including a column of ones if the model includes an intercept), plays a central role in linear regression analysis. It maps the vector of observed responses \( \mathbf{y} \) onto the vector of predicted responses \( \hat{\mathbf{y}} \):

$$
\hat{\mathbf{y}} = H\mathbf{y}
$$

### Leverage in the Hat Matrix

Leverage values are the diagonal elements \(h_{ii}\) of the [[hat matrix]] \(H\). Each \(h_{ii}\) measures the influence of the \(i\)-th observation on its own fitted value \( \hat{y}_i \), and these values provide insight into how much the presence or absence of a particular data point affects the linear regression model's behavior.

#### Properties of Leverage:

1. **Range**: Leverage values are always non-negative (\(h_{ii} \geq 0\)) and range up to 1 (\(h_{ii} \leq 1\)). 
2. **Interpretation**: A higher \(h_{ii}\) value indicates that the corresponding \(i\)-th observation has a relatively large influence on the modelâ€™s predictions. This is particularly significant if the data point is an outlier, as it might disproportionately affect the model fit.
3. **Average Leverage**: The average leverage across all observations is equal to \(p/n\), where \(p\) is the number of parameters (including the intercept) in the model, and \(n\) is the number of observations. This gives a benchmark for assessing whether a particular observation's leverage is unusually high (typically, observations with leverage values more than 2 or 3 times \(p/n\) are considered to be high leverage points).

### Effects and Implications of High Leverage

- **Influence on Estimates**: High leverage points can significantly skew the estimates of a regression model's coefficients, especially if they are also outliers in the \(y\) direction (large residuals). Such points pull the regression line or hyperplane towards themselves, potentially degrading the model's performance on other data.
- **Model Diagnostics**: Recognizing high leverage points is crucial for diagnostics and ensuring the robustness of regression models. It might necessitate further investigation, such as checking for data entry errors, reconsidering the inclusion of certain data points, or using robust regression techniques that mitigate the influence of such points.

### Visualization

Leverage values are often visualized using a leverage plot, where \(h_{ii}\) values are plotted against the index of the observations. Points with high leverage are easy to spot and scrutinize in such plots. They are sometimes also plotted against residuals to identify points that are both high leverage and have large residuals, known as influential points.

### Conclusion

Leverage is a fundamental aspect of regression diagnostics, highlighting observations that are key in shaping the regression model. By understanding and analyzing leverage, analysts can better ensure the accuracy and generalizability of their regression models, particularly by identifying and addressing points that could unduly influence model outcomes.
