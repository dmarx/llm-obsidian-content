# Critical Batch Size in Stochastic Optimization

The [[critical batch size]] represents a fundamental threshold in [[stochastic gradient descent]] (SGD) beyond which increasing the batch size no longer provides meaningful improvements in optimization efficiency. This concept is crucial for understanding the scaling behavior of [[deep learning]] systems and the fundamental trade-offs between computational efficiency and statistical learning.

## Mathematical Formalization

Let $\mathcal{L}: \Theta \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be the loss function we aim to minimize, where $\Theta$ represents the parameter space. The stochastic gradient estimate with batch size $B$ can be expressed as:

$g_B(\theta) = \frac{1}{B}\sum_{i=1}^B \nabla \ell(\theta; z_i)$

where $\ell(\theta; z_i)$ is the loss for a single sample $z_i$.

The [[gradient noise scale]] $\sigma^2(\theta)$ at a point $\theta$ is defined as:

$\sigma^2(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{z\sim\mathcal{D}}[\|\nabla \ell(\theta; z) - \nabla \mathcal{L}(\theta)\|^2]$

## Critical Batch Size Determination

The critical batch size $B_c$ emerges from the relationship between two key quantities:
1. The [[gradient noise scale]] $\sigma^2(\theta)$
2. The [[curvature scale]] of the loss landscape, characterized by the eigenvalues of the [[Hessian]] $H(\theta)$

Formally, $B_c$ can be approximated as:

$B_c \approx \frac{\sigma^2(\theta)}{\lambda_{\text{max}}(H(\theta))}$

where $\lambda_{\text{max}}(H(\theta))$ is the largest eigenvalue of the Hessian at point $\theta$.

## Theoretical Implications

The critical batch size demarcates two distinct regimes:

1. **Noise-Limited Regime** $(B < B_c)$:
   - Training dynamics are dominated by gradient noise
   - Learning rate should scale as $\eta \propto B$
   - Training time decreases roughly linearly with batch size

2. **Curvature-Limited Regime** $(B > B_c)$:
   - Training dynamics are limited by the intrinsic geometry of the loss landscape
   - Increasing batch size provides diminishing returns
   - Learning rate reaches a maximum value determined by the curvature

## Practical Considerations

The critical batch size typically varies throughout training:
- Early training: $B_c$ tends to be larger due to high gradient noise
- Late training: $B_c$ often decreases as the optimizer approaches flatter regions

The phenomenon has important implications for:
- [[Parallel training strategies]]
- [[Learning rate scheduling]]
- [[Resource allocation]] in distributed training systems

## Empirical Estimation

The critical batch size can be estimated empirically through:
1. [[Linear scaling tests]] of learning rate vs. batch size
2. [[Gradient noise scale]] measurements
3. [[Loss curvature estimation]]

A common diagnostic is the [[normalized gradient predictiveness]] (NGP):

$\text{NGP}(B) = \frac{\mathbb{E}[\langle g_B(\theta), \nabla \mathcal{L}(\theta)\rangle]}{\|\nabla \mathcal{L}(\theta)\|^2}$

where a significant deviation from linear scaling in NGP(B) indicates proximity to $B_c$.
