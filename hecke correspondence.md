Hecke Correspondence


**ASSISTANT**

The Hecke correspondence is a central concept in the study of automorphic forms, providing a geometric framework for understanding the action of Hecke operators on spaces of automorphic forms and $\mathcal{D}$-modules. It plays a crucial role in both the classical Langlands program and the Geometric Langlands program.

### Classical Hecke Correspondence

In the classical setting, Hecke operators are defined using double coset decompositions. Let \(G\) be a reductive algebraic group over a global field \(K\), and let \(G(\mathbb{A})\) denote its adelic points. For a compact open subgroup \(K_f \subset G(\mathbb{A}_f)\), the Hecke operator \(T_\gamma\) associated with a double coset \(K_f \gamma K_f\) acts on automorphic forms by convolution with the characteristic function of the double coset.

#### Example: \(GL_2(\mathbb{Q})\)

Consider \(G = GL_2\) over \(\mathbb{Q}\) and a classical modular form \(f\) on the upper half-plane \(\mathbb{H}\). The Hecke operator \(T_n\) for an integer \(n\) acts on \(f\) by:
$$
(T_n f)(z) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{\substack{ad = n \\ 0 \leq b < d}} f\left( \frac{az + b}{d} \right).
$$
This operator can be interpreted geometrically in terms of correspondences on modular curves.

### Hecke Correspondence in Geometric Langlands

In the geometric setting, the Hecke correspondence provides a geometric analog of classical Hecke operators, acting on $\mathcal{D}$-modules or sheaves on the moduli stack of $G$-bundles. Let $X$ be a smooth projective curve over a field $k$, and let $G$ be a reductive algebraic group.

#### Moduli Stack of \(G\)-Bundles

The moduli stack $\text{Bun}_G(X)$ parametrizes $G$-bundles over $X$. The Hecke correspondence involves modifications of these $G$-bundles at a point \(x \in X\).

#### Hecke Modifications

Given a point \(x \in X\) and a dominant coweight \(\lambda\) of $G$, the Hecke modification $H_x^\lambda$ describes how to modify a $G$-bundle \(\mathcal{E}\) at \(x\) to obtain a new $G$-bundle \(\mathcal{E}'\). This modification corresponds to a Hecke operator acting on $\mathcal{D}$-modules or sheaves on $\text{Bun}_G(X)$.

### Formal Definition

The Hecke correspondence is defined via correspondences on the moduli stack. For a fixed point \(x \in X\) and a dominant coweight \(\lambda\), consider the diagram:
$$
\text{Hecke}_x^\lambda = \{ (\mathcal{E}, \mathcal{E}', \phi) \mid \phi: \mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{E}' \text{ is a modification of type } \lambda \text{ at } x \},
$$
with projection maps:
$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
& \text{Hecke}_x^\lambda & \\
\swarrow & & \searrow \\
\text{Bun}_G(X) & & \text{Bun}_G(X)
\end{array}
$$
The Hecke operator \(H_x^\lambda\) acts on a sheaf or $\mathcal{D}$-module \(\mathcal{F}\) on \(\text{Bun}_G(X)\) by pulling back along one projection, tensoring with a line bundle associated to the modification, and pushing forward along the other projection:
$$
H_x^\lambda(\mathcal{F}) = p_{2*}(p_1^* \mathcal{F} \otimes \mathcal{L}_\lambda),
$$
where \(p_1\) and \(p_2\) are the projections from the Hecke correspondence to the moduli stack, and \(\mathcal{L}_\lambda\) is a line bundle associated with the modification of type \(\lambda\).

### Hecke Eigensheaves

A $\mathcal{D}$-module \(\mathcal{F}\) on \(\text{Bun}_G(X)\) is called a Hecke eigensheaf if it transforms in a specific way under the action of Hecke operators. Specifically, \(\mathcal{F}\) is a Hecke eigensheaf with eigenvalue \(\mathcal{E}\), a local system on \(X\), if:
$$
H_x^\lambda(\mathcal{F}) \cong \mathcal{F} \boxtimes \mathcal{E}_x^\lambda,
$$
for all \(x \in X\) and dominant coweights \(\lambda\), where \(\mathcal{E}_x^\lambda\) is the fiber of the local system \(\mathcal{E}\) at \(x\), twisted by \(\lambda\).

### Applications and Importance

The Hecke correspondence is crucial in the study of the Geometric Langlands Conjecture, which posits a deep connection between $\mathcal{D}$-modules on the moduli stack of $G$-bundles and local systems on the curve \(X\). This correspondence has applications in:

- **Representation Theory**: Understanding the actions of Hecke operators on automorphic forms and their geometric analogs.
- **Algebraic Geometry**: Studying the moduli spaces and their correspondences.
- **Mathematical Physics**: Connections to quantum field theory and string theory.

Overall, the Hecke correspondence provides a powerful tool for exploring the deep relationships between geometry, representation theory, and number theory.
