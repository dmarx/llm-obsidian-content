**USER**

eternal september


**ASSISTANT**

"Eternal September" refers to a cultural shift on the early internet, particularly Usenet, that began in September 1993. It marked a significant change in the dynamics of online communities, driven by a sudden influx of new, inexperienced users who were unfamiliar with the established norms and etiquette of those communities.

### Background: Usenet and the Academic Cycle
Before the 1990s, the internet (and Usenet in particular) was largely limited to universities, research institutions, and tech-savvy enthusiasts. Each year, around September, new college students would gain access to Usenet through their academic institutions. These newcomers typically lacked experience with the protocols of online communication, which often led to breaches of "netiquette"—the informal rules governing acceptable behavior on forums.

However, this influx of new users in September was manageable because it was temporary. The community would adjust, and the new users would eventually conform to the established norms, allowing the culture to stabilize.

### September 1993: The Onset of Eternal September
In 1993, **America Online (AOL)**, one of the largest internet service providers at the time, opened access to Usenet for its millions of users. This led to a permanent wave of inexperienced users joining the network. Unlike the annual influx of students, which receded as they adapted, the AOL users came in such overwhelming numbers and on a continuous basis that Usenet's ability to assimilate them broke down. The result was a steady degradation of established norms and etiquette on Usenet.

This unceasing flood of new users became known as "Eternal September" because it created the conditions of a never-ending September: a period where the influx of new users was no longer seasonal but continuous.

### Broader Implications
The phenomenon of "Eternal September" is often used to illustrate a general pattern of how online communities can evolve (or degrade) when exposed to large numbers of new members who are unfamiliar with the culture. It presaged many similar transitions in other internet platforms, such as the shift from niche, tech-savvy users to mass adoption by a general audience on platforms like forums, social media, and content aggregators.

### Cultural and Technical Impact
1. **Cultural Dilution:** Usenet’s strong culture of netiquette and its technical focus became diluted, as the newcomers lacked the same knowledge and interest in maintaining these standards.
2. **Moderation Strain:** The ability of experienced users and moderators to enforce norms and correct behavior became overwhelmed by the sheer volume of new participants.
3. **Precursor to Internet Mass Adoption:** "Eternal September" can be seen as a key moment in the broader trend of the internet becoming a public utility, accessible to the general population rather than being a tool for researchers, academics, and enthusiasts.

### Analogies and Usage Today
The concept of "Eternal September" has become an enduring metaphor for other online platforms facing similar challenges. For instance, as Reddit and Twitter expanded in popularity, they too experienced similar issues where new users unfamiliar with established norms created tensions within the community.

If you're drawing connections between "Eternal September" and modern platforms, you might invoke ideas like **network effects**, community dynamics, and governance, especially in contexts where online etiquette is eroding due to mass onboarding.
