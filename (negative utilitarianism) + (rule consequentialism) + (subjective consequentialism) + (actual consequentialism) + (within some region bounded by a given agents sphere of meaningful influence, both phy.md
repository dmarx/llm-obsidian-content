(Negative Utilitarianism) + (Rule Consequentialism) + (Subjective Consequentialism) + (Actual Consequentialism) + ([within some region bounded by a given agents sphere of meaningful influence, both physically and socially] Utilitarianism)


**ASSISTANT**

Combining elements from Negative Utilitarianism, Rule Consequentialism, Subjective Consequentialism, Actual Consequentialism, and a region-specific approach within an agent's sphere of meaningful influence leads to a nuanced ethical framework. This hybrid theory would evaluate the morality of actions based on their real-world consequences, prioritizing the reduction of suffering, adhering to general rules, considering the agent's knowledge and intentions, and focusing on the agent's sphere of influence. Here's a detailed breakdown of this integrated approach:

### 1. Negative Utilitarianism

**Core Principle**: The primary moral objective is to minimize suffering. Actions are judged based on their effectiveness in reducing pain and suffering.

### 2. Rule Consequentialism

**Core Principle**: The morality of an action is determined by whether it conforms to rules that, if generally followed, would lead to the best overall outcomes. In this context, the best outcomes are those that minimize suffering.

### 3. Subjective Consequentialism

**Core Principle**: Actions are evaluated based on the agent's knowledge, beliefs, and intentions. An action is right if, given the information available to the agent, it is expected to minimize suffering.

### 4. Actual Consequentialism

**Core Principle**: Actions are judged by their actual outcomes rather than idealized or hypothetical scenarios. The focus is on the real-world effects of actions in reducing suffering.

### 5. Sphere of Meaningful Influence

**Core Principle**: The evaluation of actions is restricted to the region within which the agent can exert meaningful influence, both physically and socially. This localized focus ensures that the agent's efforts to reduce suffering are practical and effective.

### Integrated Ethical Framework

This integrated ethical framework can be formalized by combining these principles into a coherent decision-making model. Let's define the key components and their interactions.

#### Variables and Definitions

- \( A \): Action being evaluated.
- \( R \): Set of rules that guide actions.
- \( K \): Knowledge and beliefs of the agent.
- \( O(A) \): Actual outcomes of action \( A \).
- \( S(A) \): Suffering reduced by action \( A \).
- \( I \): Agent's sphere of meaningful influence.

#### Hybrid Model

The morality of an action \( A \) can be expressed as a function \( M(A) \) that combines these elements. The function can be defined as follows:

$$
M(A) = f \left( \sum_{A \in R} \sum_{i \in I} S_i(O(A)), K \right)
$$

where:
- \( S_i(O(A)) \) is the reduction of suffering for individual \( i \) within the agent's sphere of influence \( I \), resulting from the actual outcome \( O(A) \) of action \( A \).
- \( R \) is the set of rules that, if followed, are expected to minimize suffering.
- \( K \) represents the knowledge and beliefs of the agent, influencing the expected effectiveness of \( A \).

### Steps for Decision-Making

1. **Identify Relevant Rules**: Determine the set of rules \( R \) that are expected to generally minimize suffering.
2. **Assess Knowledge and Beliefs**: Consider the agent's current knowledge \( K \) about the situation and potential outcomes.
3. **Evaluate Actual Outcomes**: Focus on the actual consequences \( O(A) \) of actions within the agent's sphere of influence \( I \).
4. **Measure Suffering Reduction**: Calculate the reduction of suffering \( S(A) \) for affected individuals \( i \).
5. **Integrate Components**: Use the hybrid model \( M(A) \) to integrate these components and determine the moral worth of the action.

### Example Application

Consider an agent deciding whether to implement a new public health policy within a community (their sphere of influence). The steps would involve:

1. **Identify Relevant Rules**: Determine guidelines and best practices for public health policies that are generally effective in reducing suffering.
2. **Assess Knowledge and Beliefs**: Evaluate the agent's understanding of the community's health needs and potential impacts of the policy.
3. **Evaluate Actual Outcomes**: Focus on the real-world effects of implementing the policy, such as improved health outcomes and reduced disease incidence.
4. **Measure Suffering Reduction**: Calculate the reduction in suffering (e.g., fewer illnesses, lower mortality rates) within the community.
5. **Integrate Components**: Use the hybrid model to assess whether the policy aligns with the rules, is informed by the agent's knowledge, and effectively reduces suffering within the community.

### Conclusion

This integrated ethical framework leverages the strengths of Negative Utilitarianism, Rule Consequentialism, Subjective Consequentialism, Actual Consequentialism, and a localized focus on the agent's sphere of influence. By combining these elements, the framework provides a comprehensive approach to ethical decision-making that prioritizes the reduction of suffering, adheres to beneficial rules, considers the agent's knowledge and intentions, and focuses on practical outcomes within a meaningful context. This approach ensures that moral evaluations are both theoretically robust and practically relevant.
