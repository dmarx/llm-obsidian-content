**ASSISTANT**

### **Dynamic Agent Creation: Implementing Self-Organizing Systems**

In this assignment, students will implement a system where agents have the ability to **spawn other agents dynamically** based on the requirements of the task. This concept introduces the idea of **self-organizing systems**, where agents can autonomously create new agents, delegate tasks, and collaborate to achieve complex objectives. This is particularly useful for scenarios where the scope or complexity of a problem evolves during execution, and new types of agents are needed to handle specific subtasks.

### **Objective**:
1. Enable agents to **dynamically create new agents** during runtime based on evolving tasks.
2. Design a **self-organizing system** where agents assign roles to newly spawned agents to handle specific subtasks.
3. Explore how agents can delegate tasks, collaborate, and interact with dynamically created agents in real-time.

---

### **Step 1: Revisiting the Agent Abstraction**

We start with the familiar **Agent** abstraction. Each agent will now have the ability to **create new agents** when they identify that a particular subtask requires additional expertise or resources.

#### **Enhanced Agent Definition**:

```python
class Agent:
    def __init__(self, name, system_prompt_template):
        """
        Initialize the agent with a name and a system prompt template.
        
        Arguments:
        - name: The name of the agent.
        - system_prompt_template: The prompt that defines the agent's role or position.
        """
        self.name = name
        self.system_prompt_template = system_prompt_template
        self.history = []  # Track conversation history

    def get_system_prompt(self):
        """
        Render the system prompt that defines the agent's perspective or philosophical position.
        """
        return self.system_prompt_template

    def query_openai(self, user_input):
        """
        Simulate querying a language model to generate a response.
        
        Arguments:
        - user_input: The input or statement to respond to.
        
        Returns:
        - A response generated by the agent based on the input.
        """
        # Simulate agent thinking and responding
        self.history.append({"role": "user", "content": user_input})
        
        # Simulated response (In practice, you'd query an LLM like GPT-4)
        response = f"As {self.name}, my response to '{user_input}' is based on {self.get_system_prompt()}."
        
        self.history.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response})
        return response

    def create_new_agent(self, name, system_prompt):
        """
        Dynamically create a new agent with a specified name and system prompt.
        
        Arguments:
        - name: The name of the new agent.
        - system_prompt: The system prompt template that defines the new agent's role.
        
        Returns:
        - A new Agent object.
        """
        print(f"{self.name} is spawning a new agent: {name}")
        return Agent(name, system_prompt)
```

---

### **Step 2: Designing Dynamic Task Delegation**

Agents need to identify when a task requires new agents to be created. For example, a **Research Agent** might realize that a specialized **Data Analysis Agent** is needed to process the research results, or a **Writer Agent** may spawn an **Editor Agent** to refine the generated text.

#### **Dynamic Task Delegation Example**:

We’ll implement a system where an agent can:
1. **Identify subtasks** during execution.
2. **Dynamically spawn new agents** to handle those subtasks.
3. **Delegate tasks** to the newly created agents.

```python
class DynamicTaskManager:
    def __init__(self):
        """
        Initialize the task manager that coordinates dynamic agent creation and task delegation.
        """
        self.agents = []

    def add_agent(self, agent):
        """
        Add a new agent to the system.
        
        Arguments:
        - agent: An instance of the Agent class.
        """
        self.agents.append(agent)

    def assign_task(self, agent, task):
        """
        Assign a task to a specified agent. If the agent needs to spawn a new agent for a subtask, it will.
        
        Arguments:
        - agent: The agent to assign the task to.
        - task: A string representing the task.
        """
        print(f"Assigning task: '{task}' to {agent.name}")
        
        # Simulate the agent performing the task
        response = agent.query_openai(f"How will you handle the task: {task}?")
        print(f"{agent.name} response: {response}")
        
        # If the task is complex, spawn a new agent dynamically
        if "research" in task:
            # The agent decides to create a specialized Research Agent
            new_agent = agent.create_new_agent(
                name="Research Agent",
                system_prompt="You are a research assistant. Your goal is to gather detailed and accurate information on any topic."
            )
            self.agents.append(new_agent)
            print(f"{new_agent.name} has been created to assist with the task.")
            # Assign the research subtask to the new agent
            self.assign_task(new_agent, "gather information on the topic")
```

---

### **Step 3: Implementing Dynamic Agent Creation in a Scenario**

We’ll simulate a scenario where an agent receives a complex task like **writing a research report**. The initial agent will create new agents as needed to handle subtasks (e.g., research, data analysis, editing).

#### **Example Scenario**:

```python
# Initialize the task manager
task_manager = DynamicTaskManager()

# Create the initial agent (e.g., a Writer Agent)
writer_agent = Agent(name="Writer Agent", system_prompt_template="You are a writer. Your task is to write a detailed research report.")

# Add the initial agent to the task manager
task_manager.add_agent(writer_agent)

# Assign the main task to the Writer Agent
main_task = "Write a research report on renewable energy"
task_manager.assign_task(writer_agent, main_task)
```

#### **Expected Output**:

```
Assigning task: 'Write a research report on renewable energy' to Writer Agent
Writer Agent response: As Writer Agent, my response to 'How will you handle the task: Write a research report on renewable energy?' is based on You are a writer. Your task is to write a detailed research report.

Writer Agent is spawning a new agent: Research Agent
Research Agent has been created to assist with the task.
Assigning task: 'gather information on the topic' to Research Agent
Research Agent response: As Research Agent, my response to 'How will you handle the task: gather information on the topic?' is based on You are a research assistant. Your goal is to gather detailed and accurate information on any topic.
```

In this example, the **Writer Agent** recognizes that the task requires detailed information, so it creates a **Research Agent** to gather data, enabling dynamic delegation.

---

### **Step 4: Adding More Complex Agent Interactions**

Next, we can extend this system to allow more complex interactions where:
1. Agents spawn multiple new agents based on different subtasks.
2. Agents collaborate by sharing the results of their work with others.

#### **Collaborative Agent System**:

Let’s say after the **Research Agent** gathers data, the **Writer Agent** can spawn an **Editor Agent** to refine the report.

```python
def simulate_collaborative_task(task_manager):
    # Writer Agent receives the main task
    writer_agent = Agent(name="Writer Agent", system_prompt_template="You are a writer. Your task is to write a detailed research report.")
    task_manager.add_agent(writer_agent)
    main_task = "Write a research report on climate change"
    task_manager.assign_task(writer_agent, main_task)

    # Writer Agent decides to spawn a Research Agent and an Editor Agent
    research_agent = writer_agent.create_new_agent(
        name="Research Agent", system_prompt="You are a research assistant. Gather detailed facts on climate change."
    )
    editor_agent = writer_agent.create_new_agent(
        name="Editor Agent", system_prompt="You are an editor. Your job is to refine the report for clarity and coherence."
    )
    task_manager.add_agent(research_agent)
    task_manager.add_agent(editor_agent)

    # Assign subtasks
    task_manager.assign_task(research_agent, "Research the effects of climate change.")
    task_manager.assign_task(editor_agent, "Edit the research report to improve clarity.")
```

---

### **Step 5: Running the Dynamic Agent System**

We can now run the simulation where agents dynamically create others to handle specific subtasks and collaborate on completing the overall objective.

```python
# Initialize the task manager and run the collaborative simulation
task_manager = DynamicTaskManager()
simulate_collaborative_task(task_manager)
```

#### **Expected Output**:

```
Assigning task: 'Write a research report on climate change' to Writer Agent
Writer Agent response: As Writer Agent, my response to 'How will you handle the task: Write a research report on climate change?' is based on You are a writer. Your task is to write a detailed research report.

Writer Agent is spawning a new agent: Research Agent
Writer Agent is spawning a new agent: Editor Agent

Assigning task: 'Research the effects of climate change' to Research Agent
Research Agent response: As Research Agent, my response to 'How will you handle the task: Research the effects of climate change?' is based on You are a research assistant. Gather detailed facts on climate change.

Assigning task: 'Edit the research report to improve clarity' to Editor Agent
Editor Agent response: As Editor Agent, my response to 'How will you handle the task: Edit the research report to improve clarity?' is based on You are an editor. Your job is to refine the report for clarity and coherence.
```
