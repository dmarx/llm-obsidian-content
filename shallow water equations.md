Shallow Water Equations

### Shallow Water Equations

The **Shallow Water Equations (SWEs)** are a set of hyperbolic partial differential equations that describe the flow of a thin layer of fluid, where the horizontal dimensions are much larger than the vertical dimension. These equations are commonly used in [[geophysical fluid dynamics]] to model phenomena such as tides, storm surges, and large-scale ocean and atmospheric waves.

### Overview

The shallow water equations are derived under the assumption that the horizontal length scales of the flow are much greater than the vertical length scale (i.e., the fluid depth is small compared to the horizontal extent). This assumption simplifies the full Navier-Stokes equations by vertically integrating the equations of motion and assuming that the vertical pressure distribution is hydrostatic.

### Governing Equations

The shallow water equations consist of the **continuity equation** (mass conservation) and **momentum equations** for the horizontal components of velocity.

1. **Continuity Equation (Mass Conservation)**:
   $$
   \frac{\partial h}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (h \mathbf{u}) = 0
   $$
   where:
   - \( h(x, y, t) \) is the fluid depth at position \( (x, y) \) and time \( t \).
   - \( \mathbf{u} = (u, v) \) is the horizontal velocity vector, with \( u \) and \( v \) being the velocity components in the \( x \) and \( y \) directions, respectively.
   - \( \nabla \cdot (h \mathbf{u}) \) represents the divergence of the flow, indicating how the volume of the fluid changes due to the horizontal movement of the fluid.

2. **Momentum Equations**:
   The momentum equations express the conservation of momentum in the horizontal plane, accounting for forces such as pressure gradients, Coriolis force, and external forces.

   - **Zonal Momentum (x-component)**:
     $$
     \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + u \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + v \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} + g \frac{\partial h}{\partial x} = -fv + \text{friction terms}
     $$
     where \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity and \( f \) is the Coriolis parameter.

   - **Meridional Momentum (y-component)**:
     $$
     \frac{\partial v}{\partial t} + u \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} + v \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} + g \frac{\partial h}{\partial y} = fu + \text{friction terms}
     $$

   These equations represent the balance of forces acting on the fluid, including the Coriolis force (which arises due to the rotation of the Earth) and the pressure gradient force, which is proportional to the slope of the water surface.

### Assumptions and Simplifications

1. **Hydrostatic Balance**: The pressure at any point in the fluid is assumed to be proportional to the depth of the fluid above that point, leading to a linear pressure distribution with depth:
   $$
   p(z) = \rho g (h - z)
   $$
   where \( z \) is the vertical coordinate, \( \rho \) is the fluid density, and \( h \) is the total fluid depth.

2. **Shallow Water Approximation**: The vertical acceleration and vertical momentum equations are neglected, simplifying the 3D fluid dynamics into a 2D system. The fluid layer is assumed to be thin, so the vertical velocity is negligible compared to horizontal velocities.

### Coordinate Systems

The shallow water equations can be formulated in different coordinate systems depending on the application:

- **Cartesian Coordinates (x, y)**: Typically used in regional models or small-scale studies where the Earth's curvature is negligible.
  
- **Spherical Coordinates (λ, φ)**: Used in global models, where \( λ \) is longitude and \( φ \) is latitude. In this case, the equations must also account for the curvature of the Earth and variations in the Coriolis parameter.

### Numerical Solutions

Solving the shallow water equations numerically involves discretizing both time and space:

1. **Finite Difference Method (FDM)**: The domain is discretized into a grid, and derivatives are approximated using differences between neighboring grid points.
  
2. **Finite Volume Method (FVM)**: The domain is divided into control volumes, and fluxes across the boundaries of these volumes are computed to conserve mass and momentum.

3. **Spectral Methods**: In global models, spectral methods may be used, where the solution is expanded in terms of basis functions, like spherical harmonics, to capture the global structure of the flow.

4. **Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM)**: This is a kinetic method used to solve fluid flow problems, and it has been adapted to simulate shallow water flows.

### Applications

The shallow water equations are widely used to model various geophysical and environmental phenomena, including:

- **Tsunamis**: The propagation of tsunami waves across the ocean can be effectively modeled using the shallow water equations.
  
- **Storm Surges**: Predicting the impact of storm surges on coastal areas relies on shallow water models, especially in the presence of complex topography.

- **Tidal Flows**: The equations are used to model the movement of tides in oceans, seas, and estuaries.

- **Atmospheric Dynamics**: In atmospheric science, the shallow water equations serve as a simplified model for understanding wave propagation in the atmosphere, such as Rossby waves and [[gravity waves]].

### Extensions and Variants

1. **Nonlinear Shallow Water Equations**: The full, nonlinear version of the shallow water equations includes terms representing the advection of momentum, which are essential for capturing phenomena like [[shock waves]] or bores.

2. **Linearized Shallow Water Equations**: These are used in situations where perturbations are small, and the equations can be linearized around a basic state. This is useful for studying wave phenomena in a more analytically tractable form.

3. **Shallow Water Equations with Topography**: When modeling real-world scenarios, the effects of varying bottom topography are included by modifying the continuity and momentum equations to account for changes in water depth due to the underlying terrain.

### Importance in Geophysical Fluid Dynamics

The shallow water equations are fundamental in [[geophysical fluid dynamics]] because they capture the essential physics of many large-scale flows while being computationally simpler than the full 3D Navier-Stokes equations. They provide a tractable way to study fluid dynamics in oceans, atmospheres, and other environments where the vertical dimension is much smaller than the horizontal scales of interest.

### Conclusion

The **shallow water equations** are a powerful tool in the study of geophysical flows, offering a balance between simplicity and the ability to model complex, large-scale fluid dynamics. Their use spans a wide range of applications, from [[oceanography]] to atmospheric science, making them indispensable in both theoretical research and practical modeling efforts.
