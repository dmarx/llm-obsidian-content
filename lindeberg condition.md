**USER**

the Lindeberg condition


**ASSISTANT**

The Lindeberg condition is a criterion used to establish the central limit theorem (CLT) for sequences of independent, but not necessarily identically distributed, random variables. The condition helps ensure that the contribution of any individual random variable to the total variance is small, thus allowing the sum to converge in distribution to a normal distribution.

### Statement of the Lindeberg Condition

Consider a sequence of independent random variables \(\{X_i\}\) with means \(E[X_i] = \mu_i\) and variances \(\text{Var}(X_i) = \sigma_i^2\). Define the normalized sum of these random variables as:
$$ S_n = \sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \mu_i). $$

Let \( \sigma_n^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n \sigma_i^2 \) be the total variance of the sum \( S_n \). The sequence \(\{X_i\}\) satisfies the Lindeberg condition if for every \(\epsilon > 0\):
$$ \frac{1}{\sigma_n^2} \sum_{i=1}^n E \left[ (X_i - \mu_i)^2 \mathbf{1}_{\{|X_i - \mu_i| > \epsilon \sigma_n\}} \right] \to 0 \quad \text{as} \quad n \to \infty. $$

### Interpretation

The Lindeberg condition essentially ensures that the probability of any individual term \(X_i - \mu_i\) being large relative to \(\sigma_n\) (the standard deviation of the sum) becomes negligible as \(n\) increases. This prevents any single term from having a disproportionate influence on the distribution of the sum.

### Central Limit Theorem with the Lindeberg Condition

If the sequence \(\{X_i\}\) satisfies the Lindeberg condition, then the normalized sum \( S_n / \sigma_n \) converges in distribution to a standard normal distribution:
$$ \frac{S_n}{\sigma_n} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \mu_i)}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n \sigma_i^2}} \xrightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}(0,1) \quad \text{as} \quad n \to \infty. $$

### Proof Sketch

1. **Finite-Dimensional Convergence**:
   Show that for any fixed \(t \in \mathbb{R}\), the characteristic function of \( S_n / \sigma_n \) converges to the characteristic function of \(\mathcal{N}(0,1)\).

2. **Lindeberg Condition Implication**:
   Use the Lindeberg condition to control the contribution of large deviations. Specifically, show that the truncation of \(X_i\) at \(\epsilon \sigma_n\) does not affect the asymptotic distribution.

3. **Lyapunov’s Central Limit Theorem**:
   The Lindeberg condition is closely related to Lyapunov’s condition, which requires that the \( (2 + \delta) \)-th moments of the \(X_i\) are bounded. Lyapunov’s CLT is often used to prove the Lindeberg-Feller CLT.

### Examples

#### Example 1: Identically Distributed Case

For identically distributed random variables with \( E[X_i] = \mu \) and \( \text{Var}(X_i) = \sigma^2 \):
- The Lindeberg condition simplifies to:
  $$ \frac{1}{n \sigma^2} \sum_{i=1}^n E \left[ (X_i - \mu)^2 \mathbf{1}_{\{|X_i - \mu| > \epsilon \sqrt{n} \sigma\}} \right] \to 0 \quad \text{as} \quad n \to \infty. $$
- This is automatically satisfied if \(X_i\) has a finite second moment.

#### Example 2: Non-Identically Distributed Case

Consider random variables with different variances:
- Let \(X_i\) be such that \(\sigma_i^2 = i^{-1}\) and \(E[X_i] = 0\).
- The Lindeberg condition becomes:
  $$ \frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^n i^{-1}} \sum_{i=1}^n E \left[ X_i^2 \mathbf{1}_{\{|X_i| > \epsilon \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n i^{-1}}\}} \right] \to 0. $$
- This requires careful checking, but if \(X_i\) are bounded, the condition will typically be satisfied.

### Applications

1. **Sum of Random Variables**:
   Ensures that the sum of independent, non-identically distributed random variables converges to a normal distribution, which is fundamental in various fields such as statistics, econometrics, and finance.

2. **Random Walks and Processes**:
   Used to analyze the behavior of random walks and more complex stochastic processes, where step sizes or increments may vary.

3. **Statistical Inference**:
   Provides the theoretical foundation for asymptotic normality of estimators and test statistics in non-i.i.d. settings.
