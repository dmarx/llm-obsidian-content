    - Ensuring safe and accessible infrastructure for walking and cycling.

2. **Complete Streets Policies**:
    - Designing streets that accommodate all users, including pedestrians, cyclists, public transit riders, and motorists.
    - Implementing [[traffic calming]] measures, such as curb extensions, speed humps, and raised crosswalks.

### 6. Smart Parking Management

1. **Dynamic Pricing and Availability**:
    - Using sensors and mobile apps to provide real-time information on parking availability and pricing.
    - Adjusting parking fees based on demand to optimize usage and reduce the time spent searching for parking.

2. **Park-and-Ride Facilities**:
    - Establishing convenient park-and-ride lots near transit hubs to encourage the use of public transportation.
    - Providing secure and affordable parking options for commuters.

### 7. Freight and Logistics Management

1. **Off-Peak Deliveries**:
    - Encouraging or mandating freight deliveries during off-peak hours to reduce congestion during busy times.
    - Incentivizing businesses to adopt off-peak delivery schedules.

2. **Freight-Only Lanes**:
    - Designating specific lanes or routes for freight vehicles to streamline movement and reduce conflicts with passenger vehicles.
    - Enhancing efficiency and safety for both freight and passenger traffic.

### 8. Data Analytics and Predictive Modeling

1. **Big Data Analytics**:
    - Analyzing large datasets from various sources, such as traffic sensors, GPS, and social media, to identify patterns and predict traffic conditions.
    - Using insights to optimize traffic management strategies and infrastructure planning.

2. **Simulation and Modeling**:
    - Creating detailed simulations of traffic scenarios to test the impact of different management strategies.
    - Using predictive modeling to forecast future traffic trends and plan accordingly.
