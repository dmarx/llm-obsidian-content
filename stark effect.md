Stark Effect


**ASSISTANT**

The Stark effect describes the splitting or shifting of atomic energy levels due to the presence of an external electric field. Named after Johannes Stark, who first observed it in 1913, the effect is analogous to the Zeeman effect (which involves magnetic fields) but occurs due to electric fields. The Stark effect is a crucial tool in spectroscopy, allowing for the study of atomic structures and the measurement of electric fields at the atomic scale.

### Key Concepts

1. **Perturbation by Electric Field**:
   When an external electric field \(\vec{E}\) is applied to an atom, it perturbs the Hamiltonian of the system. The perturbation Hamiltonian is given by:
   $$
   \hat{H}_{\text{Stark}} = -e \vec{E} \cdot \vec{r}
   $$
   where \(e\) is the electron charge and \(\vec{r}\) is the position operator.

2. **Effect on Energy Levels**:
   The Stark effect causes the degenerate energy levels of the atom to split or shift. The extent of the splitting depends on the strength of the electric field and the polarizability of the atom.

### Mathematical Formalism

Consider the unperturbed Hamiltonian of an atom \( \hat{H}_0 \) with eigenstates \( |n, l, m \rangle \) and corresponding eigenvalues \( E_n \):
$$
\hat{H}_0 |n, l, m \rangle = E_n |n, l, m \rangle
$$

When an external electric field \(\vec{E}\) is applied along the \(z\)-axis, the perturbation Hamiltonian is:
$$
\hat{H}_{\text{Stark}} = -e E_z z
$$

The total Hamiltonian becomes:
$$
\hat{H} = \hat{H}_0 + \hat{H}_{\text{Stark}}
$$

To first order in perturbation theory, the energy shift of a state \( |n, l, m \rangle \) is given by:
$$
\Delta E^{(1)} = \langle n, l, m | \hat{H}_{\text{Stark}} | n, l, m \rangle
$$

For states with \( l \neq 0 \), the first-order correction is often zero due to the symmetry of the wavefunctions. Therefore, second-order perturbation theory is typically required to describe the Stark effect:
$$
\Delta E^{(2)} = \sum_{k \neq n} \frac{|\langle k | \hat{H}_{\text{Stark}} | n \rangle|^2}{E_n - E_k}
$$

### Types of Stark Effect

1. **Linear Stark Effect**:
   In some systems, particularly in the presence of degenerate states (such as in Rydberg atoms or molecular states with a permanent dipole moment), the first-order perturbation can be non-zero, leading to a linear shift in energy proportional to the electric field.

2. **Quadratic Stark Effect**:
   For most atomic states, the Stark effect is quadratic, meaning the energy shift is proportional to the square of the electric field. This occurs because the first-order correction is zero and the second-order term dominates.

### Example Calculation: Hydrogen Atom

Consider the hydrogen atom in its \( n = 2 \) state. The four states involved are \( |2, 0, 0 \rangle \) (2s) and \( |2, 1, m \rangle \) (2p) with \( m = -1, 0, 1 \). The perturbation Hamiltonian in the presence of an electric field \( E_z \) is:
$$
\hat{H}_{\text{Stark}} = -e E_z z
$$

### Quadratic Stark Effect for the 2s State

For the \( |2, 0, 0 \rangle \) (2s) state, the first-order energy shift is zero:
$$
\Delta E^{(1)}_{2s} = \langle 2, 0, 0 | -e E_z z | 2, 0, 0 \rangle = 0
$$

The second-order energy shift involves summing over the 2p states:
$$
\Delta E^{(2)}_{2s} = \sum_{k} \frac{|\langle k | -e E_z z | 2, 0, 0 \rangle|^2}{E_{2s} - E_k}
$$
The relevant matrix elements are:
$$
\langle 2, 1, m | z | 2, 0, 0 \rangle \neq 0
$$

Using selection rules and the specific form of hydrogen wavefunctions, the energy shift for the 2s state due to the quadratic Stark effect is:
$$
\Delta E_{2s} = -\frac{9}{4} \alpha^2 \left( \frac{e a_0 E_z}{\hbar^2} \right)^2
$$
where \( a_0 \) is the Bohr radius and \( \alpha \) is a numerical factor obtained from the perturbation calculation.

### Linear Stark Effect for the 2p States

For the \( |2, 1, m \rangle \) (2p) states, the first-order energy shift is:
$$
\Delta E^{(1)}_{2p, m} = \langle 2, 1, m | -e E_z z | 2, 1, m \rangle \neq 0
$$
This leads to a linear Stark effect, with the energy shifts proportional to the electric field:
$$
\Delta E_{2p, m} = -e E_z \langle 2, 1, m | z | 2, 1, m \rangle
$$

### Spectral Lines and Selection Rules

The Stark effect modifies the selection rules for transitions. In the presence of an electric field, the degeneracy of the states is lifted, and new transitions become allowed, leading to a more complex spectrum.

### Conclusion

The Stark effect is a fundamental phenomenon in atomic physics that provides insights into the interaction between electric fields and atomic systems. By studying the Stark effect, one can gain valuable information about atomic structure, electric field strengths, and the dynamics of electrons in atoms and molecules. The effect has wide-ranging applications in fields such as spectroscopy, quantum optics, and the study of external field effects on atomic and molecular systems.
