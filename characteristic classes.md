characteristic classes


**ASSISTANT**

**Characteristic classes** are topological invariants associated with vector bundles over a manifold, and they provide deep insights into how a vector bundle is "twisted" over the base space. These classes capture geometric information about the bundle, such as curvature, and translate it into cohomological data. Characteristic classes play a key role in many areas of topology, differential geometry, and mathematical physics.

### Overview of Vector Bundles

A **vector bundle** \( E \to M \) over a manifold \( M \) consists of a vector space assigned to each point of the manifold, smoothly varying from point to point. For example, the **tangent bundle** \( TM \) of a manifold is a vector bundle where the vector space at each point is the tangent space to the manifold at that point.

The question that characteristic classes address is: *How does a vector bundle "twist" globally over the manifold?*

### Basic Types of Characteristic Classes

There are several important types of characteristic classes depending on the kind of vector bundle (real or complex) and the structure group (orthogonal, unitary, symplectic, etc.). Below are the most common ones:

#### 1. **Stiefel-Whitney Classes**

- **Vector bundle**: Real vector bundle
- **Cohomology group**: \( H^i(M; \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}) \) (mod 2 coefficients)
- **Purpose**: Stiefel-Whitney classes describe how a real vector bundle twists over the base space. They provide information about orientability, embeddability, and the existence of spin structures.
  
  The first two Stiefel-Whitney classes have special interpretations:
  - \( w_1(E) \): Describes the **orientability** of the vector bundle. A manifold is orientable if its first Stiefel-Whitney class vanishes.
  - \( w_2(E) \): Describes whether the bundle admits a **spin structure**. If \( w_2(E) = 0 \), the manifold or bundle admits a spin structure.

#### 2. **Chern Classes**

- **Vector bundle**: Complex vector bundle
- **Cohomology group**: \( H^{2i}(M; \mathbb{Z}) \) (integral cohomology)
- **Purpose**: Chern classes describe how a **complex vector bundle** twists over a manifold. For a complex vector bundle \( E \to M \), the **total Chern class** is a formal sum:
  
  $$
  c(E) = 1 + c_1(E) + c_2(E) + \cdots,
  $$

  where \( c_i(E) \in H^{2i}(M; \mathbb{Z}) \) are the **Chern classes** of \( E \). The Chern classes measure the topological "obstructions" to trivializing the vector bundle globally.

- **First Chern Class** \( c_1(E) \): Measures the degree of twisting of a complex line bundle (rank-1 complex vector bundle) over a manifold. It is closely related to the **curvature** of the bundle.
  
- **Chern Character**: An important variant of Chern classes is the **Chern character**, which is used in the **Atiyahâ€“Singer Index Theorem**. The Chern character \( \text{ch}(E) \) is a polynomial that combines all the Chern classes into a single expression, playing a key role in linking the analytic and topological aspects of vector bundles.

#### 3. **Pontryagin Classes**

- **Vector bundle**: Real vector bundle
- **Cohomology group**: \( H^{4i}(M; \mathbb{Z}) \) (integral cohomology)
- **Purpose**: Pontryagin classes are characteristic classes of **real vector bundles**, derived from the curvature of the bundle. For the tangent bundle \( TM \) of a manifold, the Pontryagin classes describe how the manifold is embedded in higher-dimensional Euclidean space and provide information about the manifold's curvature.

  The **total Pontryagin class** of a real vector bundle \( E \) is written as:

  $$
  p(E) = 1 + p_1(E) + p_2(E) + \cdots,
  $$

  where \( p_i(E) \in H^{4i}(M; \mathbb{Z}) \) are the **Pontryagin classes**. These classes are particularly important in **[[spin geometry]]** and in the study of **cobordism**.

#### 4. **Euler Class**

- **Vector bundle**: Real oriented vector bundle
- **Cohomology group**: \( H^n(M; \mathbb{Z}) \), where \( n \) is the rank of the bundle.
- **Purpose**: The **Euler class** of an oriented real vector bundle is a topological invariant that generalizes the classical **Euler characteristic** of a manifold. For a manifold \( M \), the Euler class \( e(E) \) provides information about the zeroes of sections of the vector bundle.

  If \( E = TM \), the Euler class captures the number of zeroes (counted with signs) of a generic vector field on the manifold.

### Summary of Key Types of Characteristic Classes

| Characteristic Class | Vector Bundle Type | Cohomology Group | Interpretation |
|----------------------|--------------------|------------------|----------------|
| Stiefel-Whitney Class \( w_i(E) \) | Real vector bundle | \( H^i(M; \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}) \) | Describes orientability, spin structures, embeddability |
| Chern Class \( c_i(E) \) | Complex vector bundle | \( H^{2i}(M; \mathbb{Z}) \) | Describes twisting of complex vector bundles |
| Pontryagin Class \( p_i(E) \) | Real vector bundle | \( H^{4i}(M; \mathbb{Z}) \) | Measures topological and geometric embedding properties of the bundle |
| Euler Class \( e(E) \) | Oriented real vector bundle | \( H^n(M; \mathbb{Z}) \) | Generalizes the Euler characteristic; related to the zeros of vector fields |

### Applications of Characteristic Classes

1. **Topological Invariants**: Characteristic classes are fundamental tools for distinguishing between different vector bundles over a manifold. They help classify bundles up to **isomorphism** and provide topological invariants of the base space itself.

2. **Cobordism Theory**: Characteristic classes, particularly Pontryagin and Stiefel-Whitney classes, play a key role in **cobordism theory**, which classifies manifolds up to cobordism. In this context, they are used to distinguish manifolds that are not cobordant to each other.

3. **Index Theory**: The **Atiyah-Singer Index Theorem** uses characteristic classes (such as the **\( \hat{A} \)-genus**, which is derived from Pontryagin classes) to compute the index of elliptic operators like the Dirac operator. This theorem provides deep connections between geometry, topology, and analysis.

4. **Gauge Theory and Physics**: In mathematical physics, particularly in **gauge theory** and **string theory**, characteristic classes are used to describe **gauge fields**, **anomalies**, and **D-branes**. For instance, the **first Chern class** describes the **magnetic flux** in electromagnetism, and **Chern-Simons theory** is a topological quantum field theory based on the **Chern character**.

5. **Embedding and Immersion**: Stiefel-Whitney and Pontryagin classes provide obstructions to embedding and immersing manifolds into Euclidean spaces. For example, a manifold can be immersed in a higher-dimensional Euclidean space if certain Stiefel-Whitney classes vanish.

### Summary

**Characteristic classes** are powerful tools in both mathematics and physics, allowing for the classification and analysis of vector bundles over manifolds. These classes translate geometric information (such as curvature and orientability) into cohomological invariants, providing insight into the topological structure of both the bundle and the underlying manifold. Important types of characteristic classes include **Stiefel-Whitney classes** (real bundles), **Chern classes** (complex bundles), **Pontryagin classes** (real bundles), and the **Euler class** (oriented real bundles).
