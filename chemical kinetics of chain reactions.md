chemical kinetics of chain reactions


**ASSISTANT**

Chemical kinetics of chain reactions involves the study of reaction rates and mechanisms where the reaction proceeds through a series of intermediate steps, often involving reactive intermediates like radicals. Chain reactions are characterized by their initiation, propagation, and termination steps.

### Key Concepts

1. **Initiation**: The step where reactive intermediates (radicals, ions, etc.) are formed.
2. **Propagation**: Steps where the intermediates react with stable molecules to form new intermediates, sustaining the reaction.
3. **Termination**: Steps where the intermediates are consumed, leading to the end of the chain reaction.

### Example: Hydrogen-Bromine Reaction

Consider the classic example of the hydrogen-bromine (H₂-Br₂) reaction:

\[ \text{H}_2 + \text{Br}_2 \rightarrow 2\text{HBr} \]

This reaction proceeds via a chain mechanism with the following steps:

#### Initiation
\[ \text{Br}_2 \rightarrow 2\text{Br} \]

#### Propagation
\[ \text{Br} + \text{H}_2 \rightarrow \text{HBr} + \text{H} \]
\[ \text{H} + \text{Br}_2 \rightarrow \text{HBr} + \text{Br} \]

#### Termination
\[ \text{Br} + \text{Br} \rightarrow \text{Br}_2 \]
\[ \text{H} + \text{H} \rightarrow \text{H}_2 \]
\[ \text{H} + \text{Br} \rightarrow \text{HBr} \]

### Rate Equations

To analyze the kinetics, we set up rate equations for the concentrations of the species involved. Let's denote the concentrations of H, Br, and Br₂ as [H], [Br], and [Br₂], respectively.

#### Rate of Initiation
\[ R_{\text{init}} = k_1 [\text{Br}_2] \]

#### Rate of Propagation
\[ R_{\text{prop1}} = k_2 [\text{Br}][\text{H}_2] \]
\[ R_{\text{prop2}} = k_3 [\text{H}][\text{Br}_2] \]

#### Rate of Termination
\[ R_{\text{term1}} = k_4 [\text{Br}]^2 \]
\[ R_{\text{term2}} = k_5 [\text{H}]^2 \]
\[ R_{\text{term3}} = k_6 [\text{H}][\text{Br}] \]

### Differential Equations

The differential equations for the concentrations of H and Br can be written as:

\[ \frac{d[\text{H}]}{dt} = k_2 [\text{Br}][\text{H}_2] - k_3 [\text{H}][\text{Br}_2] - 2k_5 [\text{H}]^2 - k_6 [\text{H}][\text{Br}] \]

\[ \frac{d[\text{Br}]}{dt} = 2k_1 [\text{Br}_2] + k_3 [\text{H}][\text{Br}_2] - k_2 [\text{Br}][\text{H}_2] - 2k_4 [\text{Br}]^2 - k_6 [\text{Br}][\text{H}] \]

### Steady-State Approximation

In many chain reactions, the concentration of intermediates (H and Br in this case) reaches a steady state where their rate of formation equals their rate of consumption. Under the steady-state approximation:

\[ \frac{d[\text{H}]}{dt} \approx 0 \]
\[ \frac{d[\text{Br}]}{dt} \approx 0 \]

Solving these equations under the steady-state approximation can simplify the analysis and provide insight into the reaction rates and mechanisms.

### Example Solution under Steady-State Approximation

For simplicity, let's assume:

\[ \frac{d[\text{H}]}{dt} = 0 \]
\[ k_2 [\text{Br}][\text{H}_2] = k_3 [\text{H}][\text{Br}_2] + 2k_5 [\text{H}]^2 + k_6 [\text{H}][\text{Br}] \]

Solving for [H]:

\[ [\text{H}] = \frac{k_2 [\text{Br}][\text{H}_2]}{k_3 [\text{Br}_2] + 2k_5 [\text{H}] + k_6 [\text{Br}]} \]

Similarly, for Br:

\[ \frac{d[\text{Br}]}{dt} = 0 \]
\[ 2k_1 [\text{Br}_2] + k_3 [\text{H}][\text{Br}_2] = k_2 [\text{Br}][\text{H}_2] + 2k_4 [\text{Br}]^2 + k_6 [\text{Br}][\text{H}] \]

Substitute [H] from the previous equation:

\[ 2k_1 [\text{Br}_2] + k_3 \left( \frac{k_2 [\text{Br}][\text{H}_2]}{k_3 [\text{Br}_2] + 2k_5 [\text{H}] + k_6 [\text{Br}]} \right)[\text{Br}_2] = k_2 [\text{Br}][\text{H}_2] + 2k_4 [\text{Br}]^2 + k_6 \left( \frac{k_2 [\text{Br}][\text{H}_2]}{k_3 [\text{Br}_2] + 2k_5 [\text{H}] + k_6 [\text{Br}]} \right)[\text{Br}] \]

This can be solved for [Br], and subsequently [H], to find the steady-state concentrations. These steady-state concentrations can then be used to determine the overall rate of formation of HBr:

\[ R_{\text{HBr}} = k_2 [\text{Br}][\text{H}_2] + k_3 [\text{H}][\text{Br}_2] \]

### Numerical Solution

For complex chain reactions, solving the differential equations analytically might not be feasible, and numerical methods can be employed. Here's a Python example using numerical integration (e.g., using the `scipy.integrate` module) to solve the ODEs for a chain reaction:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.integrate import solve_ivp
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the system of ODEs
def chain_reaction(t, y, k1, k2, k3, k4, k5, k6):
    [H2, Br2, H, Br, HBr] = y
    dH2_dt = -k2 * Br * H2
    dBr2_dt = -k1 * Br2 - k3 * H * Br2
    dH_dt = k2 * Br * H2 - k3 * H * Br2 - 2 * k5 * H**2 - k6 * H * Br
    dBr_dt = 2 * k1 * Br2 + k3 * H * Br2 - k2 * Br * H2 - 2 * k4 * Br**2 - k6 * Br * H
    dHBr_dt = k2 * Br * H2 + k3 * H * Br2 + k6 * H * Br
    return [dH2_dt, dBr2_dt, dH_dt, dBr_dt, dHBr_dt]

# Initial concentrations
y0 = [1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]  # [H2, Br2, H, Br, HBr]

# Rate constants
k1, k2, k3, k4, k5, k6 = 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1

# Time span for the integration
t_span = (0, 10)
t_eval = np.linspace(*t_span, 100)

# Solve the ODEs
solution = solve_ivp(chain_reaction, t_span, y0, args=(k1, k2, k3, k4, k5, k6), t_eval=t_eval)

# Plot the results
plt.plot(solution.t, solution.y[0], label='[H2]')
plt.plot(solution.t, solution.y[1], label='[Br2]')
plt.plot(solution.t, solution.y[2], label='[H]')
plt.plot(solution.t, solution.y[3], label='[Br]')
plt.plot(solution.t, solution.y[4], label='[HBr]')
plt.legend()
plt.xlabel('Time')
plt.ylabel('Concentration')
plt.title('Concentrations vs Time in a Chain Reaction')
plt.show()
```
