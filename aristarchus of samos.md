# Aristarchus of Samos

Aristarchus of Samos (c. 310 - c. 230 BCE) was a Greek mathematician and astronomer who first proposed a [[heliocentric model]] of the solar system, predating [[Copernicus]] by approximately 1800 years. His mathematical work included pioneering attempts to determine the relative distances and sizes of the [[Sun]], [[Moon]], and [[Earth]] using geometric methods.

## Mathematical Contributions

His most significant preserved work is "On the Sizes and Distances of the Sun and Moon," where he presented a geometric method for calculating the relative distances of celestial bodies. Let us define:

- α: the angle between the Moon and Sun when the Moon is exactly half illuminated
- θ: the angular diameter of the Moon's shadow during a lunar eclipse
- φ: the angular diameter of the Moon as seen from Earth

Aristarchus proposed that:
```
sin(α) = R_E/R_S
```
where:
- R_E is the Earth-Moon distance
- R_S is the Earth-Sun distance

While his measurement of α as 87° was inaccurate (the actual value is closer to 89°50'), his mathematical method was sound. The relationship can be expressed in modern vector notation as:

Let $\vec{e}$ represent the Earth-Moon vector and $\vec{s}$ represent the Earth-Sun vector. At quarter moon:
```
\cos(\alpha) = \frac{\vec{e} \cdot \vec{s}}{|\vec{e}||\vec{s}|}
```

## The [[Aristarchus Ratio]]

Aristarchus calculated that:
```
18 ≤ R_S/R_E ≤ 20
```
The actual ratio is approximately 389. Despite this numerical inaccuracy, his methodology established the foundation for [[astronomical triangulation]] and demonstrated the power of geometric reasoning in astronomy.

## Legacy in [[Mathematical Astronomy]]

His work influenced the development of:
- [[Trigonometric Methods in Astronomy]]
- [[Geometric Models of Celestial Motion]]
- [[Angular Diameter Calculations]]
- [[Parallax Measurement Techniques]]

The crater [[Aristarchus (lunar crater)]] and the nearby [[Aristarchus plateau]] are named in his honor, recognizing his foundational contributions to mathematical astronomy.

His methods particularly influenced [[Hipparchus]] and [[Ptolemy]], who built upon his geometric frameworks for calculating celestial distances, even while rejecting his heliocentric model in favor of a [[geocentric system]].

## Historical Impact on [[Scientific Method]]

Aristarchus's work exemplifies early application of:
- [[Mathematical Modeling]]
- [[Observational Astronomy]]
- [[Geometric Proof in Natural Philosophy]]
- [[Ratio-Based Measurement Systems]]

His approach to astronomical measurement laid groundwork for the later development of [[quantitative cosmology]] and the mathematical treatment of [[astronomical scaling relationships]].
