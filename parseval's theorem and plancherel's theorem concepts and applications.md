### Parseval's Theorem and Plancherel's Theorem: Concepts and Applications

Parseval's Theorem and Plancherel's Theorem are foundational results in Fourier analysis, connecting the \(L^2\) norm of a function with the \(L^2\) norm of its Fourier transform. These theorems are crucial in many areas of mathematics and engineering, particularly in signal processing, quantum physics, and any field that utilizes Fourier transform techniques.

#### Parseval's Theorem

**Parseval's Theorem** is typically stated in the context of Fourier series for functions that are periodic. The theorem asserts that the sum of the square of the absolute values of a function's Fourier coefficients is equal to the integral of the square of the absolute value of the function itself over one period. In mathematical terms, if \( f(x) \) is a periodic function with period \( T \) and Fourier series representation:

$$
f(x) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} c_n e^{i 2\pi n x / T}
$$

where \( c_n \) are the Fourier coefficients, Parseval's Theorem states:

$$
\frac{1}{T} \int_0^T |f(x)|^2 \, dx = \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty |c_n|^2
$$

This equality shows that the total energy (or power) of the signal \( f \) over its period is exactly distributed across its frequency components, represented by the Fourier coefficients.

#### Plancherel's Theorem

**Plancherel's Theorem** extends the ideas of Parseval's Theorem to non-periodic functions and their Fourier transforms, making it applicable to a broader class of functions that are square integrable (\( L^2 \)). For a function \( f \in L^2(\mathbb{R}) \), the theorem states that:

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |f(x)|^2 \, dx = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |\hat{f}(\xi)|^2 \, d\xi
$$

where \( \hat{f}(\xi) \) is the Fourier transform of \( f(x) \):

$$
\hat{f}(\xi) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{-i 2\pi \xi x} \, dx
$$

Plancherel's Theorem assures us that the \( L^2 \) norm (or energy) of the function is preserved in the Fourier transform domain.

#### Applications and Importance

1. **Signal Processing**: Both theorems are used to analyze and process signals in the frequency domain. They guarantee that transformations into the frequency domain (via Fourier transform) preserve the energy of the signal, crucial for applications in filtering, compression, and noise reduction.

2. **Quantum Mechanics**: In quantum mechanics, these theorems ensure that the probability distributions (which must integrate to one) are preserved when transforming wave functions between the position and momentum representations.

3. **Partial Differential Equations**: Solutions to PDEs often involve transforming problems into the frequency domain using Fourier transforms, where the theorems assist in ensuring that solutions are correctly normalized and preserved under transformations.

4. **Engineering and Physics**: The theorems provide foundational support in acoustics, optics, and electrical engineering, where analyzing systems in the frequency domain often simplifies the design and analysis of these systems.

#### Conclusion

Parseval's and Plancherel's Theorems not only provide critical theoretical support for the use of Fourier transforms in engineering and physics but also serve as practical tools for ensuring that computations involving these transforms are both meaningful and correct. They highlight the deep connections between time-domain and frequency-domain representations, pivotal for effective analysis and processing of signals and other functions within \( L^2 \) spaces.
