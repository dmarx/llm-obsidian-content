shear stress


**ASSISTANT**

**Shear stress** is a force per unit area that acts parallel to the surface of a material. In fluid dynamics, it refers to the tangential force exerted by a fluid as it moves over a surface or within itself due to velocity gradients. Shear stress plays a critical role in understanding how momentum is transferred within fluids and how fluids interact with solid surfaces. It is especially important in the study of **viscous flow** and the development of **boundary layers**.

### Definition of Shear Stress

Shear stress in a fluid is defined as:
$$
\tau = \mu \frac{\partial u}{\partial y}
$$
where:
- $\tau$ is the **shear stress** (N/m² or Pascals),
- $\mu$ is the **dynamic viscosity** of the fluid (Pa·s or N·s/m²),
- $\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}$ is the **velocity gradient** normal to the direction of the shear, or the **rate of strain** (1/s),
- $u$ is the velocity of the fluid in the direction parallel to the surface,
- $y$ is the direction perpendicular to the surface.

This equation is known as **Newton's law of viscosity** for a **Newtonian fluid**, where the shear stress is directly proportional to the velocity gradient. For a Newtonian fluid, the constant of proportionality is the dynamic viscosity $\mu$, which measures the fluid’s resistance to flow.

### Physical Meaning

- **Shear stress in a fluid** arises when adjacent layers of the fluid move at different velocities, creating a velocity gradient. This occurs because of the fluid’s viscosity, which resists the relative motion between fluid layers. The fluid molecules near a solid surface move more slowly due to the **[[no-slip condition]]**, while layers farther from the surface move faster, generating a velocity gradient and shear stress.
  
- **Shear stress at a surface** (e.g., along a wall or a plate) results from the fluid's interaction with the solid boundary. The fluid exerts a tangential force on the surface, and the surface, in turn, exerts an equal and opposite shear force on the fluid. This is the origin of **skin friction drag** in flows over solid objects.

### Shear Stress in Boundary Layers

In fluid flows, shear stress is significant in the **boundary layer**, where the fluid experiences the largest velocity gradients. As fluid moves over a surface, the velocity increases from zero at the surface (due to the [[no-slip condition]]) to the free-stream velocity in the outer flow. This creates a **velocity profile** within the boundary layer, leading to shear stress on the surface.

The **wall shear stress** at the surface of the boundary layer can be written as:
$$
\tau_w = \mu \left. \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} \right|_{y=0}
$$
where $\tau_w$ is the wall shear stress and $\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}$ is the velocity gradient evaluated at the surface ($y = 0$).

The **total force due to shear stress** on a surface is given by integrating the shear stress over the entire surface area:
$$
F_{\text{shear}} = \int_{A_s} \tau_w \, dA
$$
where $A_s$ is the surface area exposed to the fluid.

### Laminar vs. Turbulent Shear Stress

The behavior of shear stress in the boundary layer depends on whether the flow is **laminar** or **turbulent**:

1. **Laminar Shear Stress**:
   - In **laminar flow**, the fluid moves in smooth, orderly layers, and shear stress arises from molecular diffusion of momentum between adjacent fluid layers. The velocity gradient is smooth, and the shear stress is relatively low.
   - The shear stress in laminar flow can be calculated directly from the velocity gradient using the Newtonian viscosity relationship.

2. **Turbulent Shear Stress**:
   - In **turbulent flow**, chaotic eddies and fluctuations enhance momentum transfer between fluid layers, significantly increasing the effective shear stress. In addition to molecular viscosity, **turbulent eddies** contribute to the mixing and transfer of momentum, leading to higher shear stress.
   - The total shear stress in turbulent flow is often modeled using an **effective viscosity**, which accounts for both molecular and turbulent momentum transfer:
     $$
     \tau_{\text{turbulent}} = (\mu + \mu_t) \frac{\partial u}{\partial y}
     $$
     where $\mu_t$ is the **eddy viscosity**, representing the contribution of turbulence to the shear stress.

### Shear Stress and Drag Force

In the context of fluid flow over a surface, shear stress is responsible for the **skin friction drag** (or **viscous drag**) that acts on the object. The total drag force due to shear stress on the surface of an object is the integral of the wall shear stress over the entire wetted surface area.

For example, in flow over a flat plate, the **skin friction drag** depends on the velocity profile in the boundary layer, which in turn determines the wall shear stress.

#### Laminar Flow over a Flat Plate:
In laminar flow, the wall shear stress is lower compared to turbulent flow. The **skin friction coefficient** for laminar flow over a flat plate is given by:
$$
C_f = \frac{1.328}{\sqrt{Re_x}}
$$
where $Re_x = \frac{\rho u x}{\mu}$ is the local Reynolds number based on the distance $x$ from the leading edge of the plate.

#### Turbulent Flow over a Flat Plate:
In turbulent flow, the shear stress increases due to the enhanced momentum transfer from turbulence. The skin friction coefficient for turbulent flow can be approximated as:
$$
C_f = \frac{0.074}{Re_x^{1/5}}
$$

### Shear Stress in Fluids: Applications

1. **Pipe Flow**:
   In **pipe flow**, shear stress plays a key role in determining the pressure drop along the pipe. The shear stress at the pipe wall is related to the flow rate and fluid viscosity, and it governs the **head loss** in the system. For laminar flow in a pipe, the wall shear stress can be calculated from the Hagen-Poiseuille equation:
   $$
   \tau_w = \frac{4 \mu u_{\text{avg}}}{D}
   $$
   where $u_{\text{avg}}$ is the average flow velocity and $D$ is the pipe diameter.

2. **Aerodynamics**:
   In **aerodynamics**, shear stress is a key component of the **skin friction drag** on aircraft surfaces. Designers work to minimize skin friction drag by controlling the flow (e.g., maintaining laminar flow over the surface for as long as possible) or by using surface treatments such as riblets to reduce the effective shear stress in turbulent flows.

3. **Boundary Layer Separation**:
   Shear stress affects **[[boundary layer separation]]**. When the shear stress decreases due to an adverse pressure gradient, the fluid can no longer stay attached to the surface, leading to **flow separation** and the formation of a **wake**. Separation increases **pressure drag** and can significantly affect the performance of objects moving through fluids, such as airplanes or cars.

4. **Viscometers**:
   In **rheology**, the measurement of shear stress is essential for determining the viscosity of fluids using devices such as **rotational viscometers**. These instruments apply a known shear rate to a fluid and measure the resulting shear stress to calculate viscosity.

### Summary

**Shear stress** in fluid dynamics is a measure of the tangential force exerted by a fluid as it flows over a surface or within itself. It arises due to velocity gradients in the fluid and is directly related to the fluid's viscosity. Shear stress plays a crucial role in determining **skin friction drag**, the development of the **boundary layer**, and the overall behavior of fluid flows, particularly in the transition from laminar to turbulent flow. It is a key factor in engineering applications such as aerodynamics, pipe flow, and rheology, where controlling or predicting shear stress is essential for optimizing performance and efficiency.
