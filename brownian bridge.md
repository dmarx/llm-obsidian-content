Brownian Bridge


**ASSISTANT**

A Brownian bridge is a fundamental stochastic process that arises naturally in the study of stochastic processes, empirical processes, and statistical applications such as hypothesis testing. It is a modification of standard Brownian motion that is constrained to return to zero at a fixed endpoint.

### Definition

A Brownian bridge $B(t)$ is a stochastic process defined for $t \in [0,1]$ with the following properties:
1. \( B(0) = 0 \) and \( B(1) = 0 \) almost surely.
2. For \( 0 \leq s < t \leq 1 \), the increments \( B(t) - B(s) \) are normally distributed with mean \( 0 \) and variance \( t(1-s) \).
3. The process has continuous paths, meaning it is a continuous function of \( t \).

Formally, if \( W(t) \) is a standard Brownian motion, the Brownian bridge \( B(t) \) can be defined as:
$$ B(t) = W(t) - tW(1). $$

### Properties

1. **Mean and Covariance**:
   - The mean of \( B(t) \) is zero for all \( t \in [0,1] \):
     $$ E[B(t)] = 0. $$
   - The covariance function of \( B(t) \) is given by:
     $$ \text{Cov}(B(s), B(t)) = s(1 - t) \quad \text{for} \quad 0 \leq s \leq t \leq 1. $$

2. **Distribution**:
   - \( B(t) \) is a Gaussian process, meaning that for any finite set of points \( 0 \leq t_1 < t_2 < \ldots < t_k \leq 1 \), the vector \( (B(t_1), B(t_2), \ldots, B(t_k)) \) follows a multivariate normal distribution.

3. **Conditional Distribution**:
   - The Brownian bridge can be seen as a Brownian motion conditioned on returning to zero at time 1.

### Construction

To understand the construction of a Brownian bridge, consider the following:
- Start with a standard Brownian motion \( W(t) \) for \( t \in [0,1] \).
- The process \( W(t) \) at time 1, \( W(1) \), is a normally distributed random variable with mean 0 and variance 1.
- To ensure that the process returns to zero at time 1, we subtract the linear component \( tW(1) \), which effectively "ties" the process back to zero at \( t = 1 \).

### Applications

1. **Empirical Processes**:
   The Brownian bridge is critical in the study of empirical processes. For instance, in Donsker's Theorem, the empirical process scaled by \( \sqrt{n} \) converges in distribution to a Brownian bridge.

2. **Hypothesis Testing**:
   The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for goodness-of-fit uses the supremum of the absolute difference between the empirical distribution function and the true distribution function. Under the null hypothesis, this statistic converges to the supremum of a Brownian bridge.

3. **Simulation and Modelling**:
   Brownian bridges are used in various simulations, such as generating Brownian paths that start and end at specified values. This is useful in financial mathematics for modeling stock prices that must meet certain conditions at specific times.

### Example: Kolmogorov-Smirnov Statistic

The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic measures the maximum deviation between the empirical distribution function \( F_n(x) \) and the true distribution function \( F(x) \):
$$ D_n = \sup_{x} |F_n(x) - F(x)|. $$
Under the null hypothesis that \( X_i \) are drawn from \( F \), the KS statistic, scaled by \( \sqrt{n} \), converges in distribution to the supremum of the absolute value of a Brownian bridge \( B(t) \):
$$ \sqrt{n} D_n \rightsquiggle \sup_{0 \leq t \leq 1} |B(t)|. $$
