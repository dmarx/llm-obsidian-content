## Geochemistry

Geochemistry is the scientific study of the Earth's chemical composition and the chemical processes that occur within it. It involves analyzing the distribution and cycling of chemical elements in the Earth's crust, mantle, and core, as well as their interactions with the hydrosphere, atmosphere, and biosphere.

### Key Concepts in Geochemistry

1. **Elemental Abundance**: The distribution of chemical elements in the Earth and its components. This includes understanding the cosmic abundance of elements, which is influenced by stellar nucleosynthesis and the formation of the solar system.

2. **Isotope Geochemistry**: The study of the relative and absolute concentrations of elements' isotopes. Isotopic analysis can reveal information about the age of rocks (radiometric dating), the sources of materials, and the processes they have undergone.

3. **Geochemical Cycles**: The pathways through which chemical elements move through the Earth's systems (e.g., carbon cycle, nitrogen cycle). These cycles involve reservoirs (storage locations like the atmosphere or oceans) and fluxes (the movement of elements between reservoirs).

4. **Geochemical Processes**: These include weathering, sedimentation, magmatism, metamorphism, and biogeochemical interactions. Each process affects the distribution and form of chemical elements.

### Mathematical Framework

#### Chemical Equilibria

The study of geochemical processes often involves understanding chemical equilibria. The equilibrium constant $K$ for a reaction:

$$
aA + bB \leftrightarrow cC + dD
$$

is given by:

$$
K = \frac{{[C]^c [D]^d}}{{[A]^a [B]^b}}
$$

where $[X]$ denotes the activity (or concentration) of the species $X$.

#### Isotopic Fractionation

Isotopic fractionation describes the partitioning of isotopes between substances. The fractionation factor $\alpha$ between two substances A and B for isotope $i$ can be defined as:

$$
\alpha = \frac{(^{i}X/^{j}X)_{\text{A}}}{(^{i}X/^{j}X)_{\text{B}}}
$$

where $^{i}X$ and $^{j}X$ are the isotopes of element $X$.

### Important Techniques

1. **Mass Spectrometry**: Used to measure the concentrations of isotopes and trace elements with high precision.
2. **X-ray Fluorescence (XRF)**: Used for determining the elemental composition of samples.
3. **Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) Techniques**: ICP-OES and ICP-MS are used for detecting metals and several non-metals at low concentrations.

### Applications

- **Petrology**: Understanding the origin and composition of rocks.
- **Environmental Geochemistry**: Studying pollution, soil contamination, and the impact of human activity on natural geochemical cycles.
- **Hydrogeochemistry**: Investigating the chemical characteristics of groundwater and surface waters.
- **Biogeochemistry**: Exploring the interactions between biological and geological processes.
