>The nuclear norm is the dual norm to the operator norm (also known as the spectral norm)


**ASSISTANT**

The relationship between the nuclear norm and the operator norm (or spectral norm) in the context of matrix norms is a significant aspect of functional analysis and matrix theory, specifically within the framework of dual norms in operator spaces. Let's explore this relationship and clarify the statement that "the nuclear norm is the dual norm to the operator norm."

### Definitions and Background

#### Operator Norm (Spectral Norm)
The operator norm (or spectral norm) of a matrix \( A \) is defined as:
$$
\|A\|_2 = \sup_{\|x\|_2 = 1} \|Ax\|_2 = \sigma_{\text{max}}(A)
$$
where \( \sigma_{\text{max}}(A) \) is the largest singular value of \( A \). This norm measures the maximum stretching factor of the matrix when applied to a unit vector.

#### Nuclear Norm
The nuclear norm of a matrix \( A \), as discussed, is the sum of the singular values \( \sigma_i \) of \( A \):
$$
\|A\|_* = \sum_i \sigma_i
$$
This norm tends to promote low-rank structures in matrices.

### Dual Norm Concept

In the context of matrix norms, the dual norm \( \|B\| \) of a given matrix norm \( \|A\| \) is defined by:
$$
\|B\| = \sup \{ \text{tr}(AB^T) : \|A\| \leq 1 \}
$$
The dual norm concept essentially captures the idea of maximizing the trace of the product \( AB^T \) subject to the norm of \( A \) being bounded by 1.

### Nuclear Norm as the Dual of the Operator Norm

To understand why the nuclear norm is considered the dual of the operator norm, consider the dual norm definition applied to the operator norm:
$$
\|B\|_* = \sup \{ \text{tr}(AB^T) : \|A\|_2 \leq 1 \}
$$
For a given matrix \( B \), the trace \( \text{tr}(AB^T) \) can be maximized by choosing \( A \) such that \( A \) aligns its largest singular vectors (in direction) with those of \( B \). The optimal \( A \) in this context effectively "selects" and scales the components of \( B \) corresponding to its singular values, subject to \( \|A\|_2 \leq 1 \). The resulting expression, \( \text{tr}(AB^T) \), then becomes the sum of the products of corresponding singular values of \( A \) and \( B \), maximized when \( A \) is a rank-1 projection scaled by \( 1/\sigma_{\text{max}}(A) \).

Given this setup, the supremum of \( \text{tr}(AB^T) \) over all such \( A \) is exactly the sum of the singular values of \( B \), which is the definition of the nuclear norm of \( B \). Thus, the nuclear norm is the largest possible trace of the product of \( B \) and any \( A \) with operator norm not exceeding one, proving that the nuclear norm of \( B \) is indeed the dual norm of the operator norm.

### Conclusion

This duality relationship is particularly powerful in optimization and analysis, as it allows for the use of nuclear norm minimization as a convex surrogate for rank minimization in problems where the operator norm constraints are pivotal. This relationship underscores the utility of these norms in various advanced applications, including signal processing, data analysis, and machine learning.
