### Root Locus Analysis

Root locus analysis is a graphical method used in control theory to examine how the roots of a system's characteristic equation (poles of the closed-loop transfer function) change as a system parameter (typically the gain, \( K \)) varies. This method provides insights into the stability and transient response of a control system as the gain changes.

### Key Concepts

1. **Characteristic Equation**: The equation obtained from the closed-loop transfer function, whose roots are the poles of the system.
2. **Poles and Zeros**: Poles are values of \( s \) that make the denominator of the transfer function zero. Zeros are values of \( s \) that make the numerator zero.
3. **Root Locus**: The locus of points in the s-plane where the roots of the characteristic equation lie as the gain \( K \) varies from 0 to \( \infty \).

### Steps in Root Locus Construction

1. **Determine the Open-Loop Transfer Function**: Identify the [[open-loop transfer function]] \( G(s)H(s) \).
2. **Rewrite the Characteristic Equation**: Rewrite the characteristic equation in the standard form \( 1 + K G(s)H(s) = 0 \).
3. **Identify Poles and Zeros**: Locate the poles and zeros of \( G(s)H(s) \) on the complex s-plane.
4. **Apply Root Locus Rules**: Use specific rules to plot the root locus.

### Example: Root Locus Construction

Consider the [[open-loop transfer function]]:

$$
G(s)H(s) = \frac{K}{s(s+2)(s+4)},
$$

where \( K \) is the gain.

#### Step 1: Determine the Open-Loop Transfer Function

The [[open-loop transfer function]] is given by \( G(s)H(s) = \frac{K}{s(s+2)(s+4)} \).

#### Step 2: Rewrite the Characteristic Equation

Rewrite the characteristic equation in the standard form:

$$
1 + \frac{K}{s(s+2)(s+4)} = 0.
$$

Multiplying by the denominator to clear the fraction:

$$
s(s+2)(s+4) + K = 0.
$$

#### Step 3: Identify Poles and Zeros

Identify the poles and zeros of \( G(s)H(s) \):

- **Poles**: \( s = 0, -2, -4 \)
- **Zeros**: None (since the numerator is a constant \( K \))

#### Step 4: Apply Root Locus Rules

Use the following rules to plot the root locus:

1. **Starting and Ending Points**:
   - The root locus starts at the open-loop poles (\( s = 0, -2, -4 \)).
   - The root locus ends at the open-loop zeros. Since there are no finite zeros, they end at infinity.

2. **Real Axis Segments**:
   - The root locus exists on the real axis to the left of an odd number of real poles and zeros.
   - Thus, it will be on the segments: \( (-\infty, -4) \), \( (-2, 0) \).

3. **Asymptotes**:
   - The number of branches that go to infinity is equal to the difference between the number of poles and zeros.
   - There are 3 poles and 0 zeros, so there are 3 branches going to infinity.
   - The asymptotes' angles are given by \( \theta = \frac{(2k+1)180^\circ}{n-m} \), where \( n \) is the number of poles and \( m \) is the number of zeros, and \( k \) is an integer.
   - Angles: \( \theta = 60^\circ, 180^\circ, 300^\circ \).

4. **Asymptote Centroid**:
   - The centroid of the asymptotes is given by \( \sigma = \frac{\sum \text{Poles} - \sum \text{Zeros}}{n-m} \).
   - For the given example: \( \sigma = \frac{0 - 2 - 4}{3 - 0} = -2 \).

5. **Breakaway and Break-In Points**:
   - These points are found by solving \( \frac{dK}{ds} = 0 \) using the characteristic equation.

6. **Imaginary Axis Crossings**:
   - Determine where the root locus crosses the imaginary axis by solving the characteristic equation for purely imaginary \( s \).

### Plotting the Root Locus

1. **Plot the Poles and Zeros**:
   - Mark the poles at \( s = 0, -2, -4 \) and note the absence of zeros.

2. **Draw Real Axis Segments**:
   - Identify and draw the segments of the real axis that belong to the root locus.

3. **Draw Asymptotes**:
   - Draw the asymptotes at the calculated angles, originating from the centroid at \( \sigma = -2 \).

4. **Plot the Locus**:
   - Sketch the root locus branches starting from the poles and approaching the asymptotes or infinity.

### Using Root Locus for Control System Design

1. **Determine System Stability**:
   - Analyze the root locus to determine the values of \( K \) for which the system is stable (all poles in the left half-plane).

2. **Design Controllers**:
   - Use the root locus to design proportional, lead, lag, or PID controllers by adding poles and zeros to achieve desired pole locations.

3. **Adjust System Dynamics**:
   - Modify the gain \( K \) to achieve desired transient response characteristics such as overshoot, settling time, and damping ratio.

### Conclusion

Root locus analysis is a powerful tool for understanding how the poles of a closed-loop system move as the gain changes. By applying root locus rules, engineers can design controllers to achieve desired stability and performance characteristics.
