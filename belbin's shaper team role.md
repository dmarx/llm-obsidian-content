Belbin's "Shaper" team role


**ASSISTANT**

The "Shaper" is one of the nine team roles defined by Meredith Belbin in his Team Roles model. Shapers are dynamic and highly motivated individuals who possess great drive to overcome obstacles and push the team towards its goals. They thrive on pressure and are courageous in overcoming difficulties that the team encounters.

### Characteristics of the Shaper

**Strengths**: Shapers are known for their ability to challenge the norm and stimulate others to move forward. They are very goal-oriented and have a clear vision of what they want to achieve. They are competitive and like to win, which fuels their determination.

**Behavioral Traits**:
- Shapers are often aggressive and assertive, willing to take on challenges and lead the charge against obstacles.
- They possess a high level of emotional energy that manifests as enthusiasm and the capacity to motivate others.
- Shapers are often seen as people who are quick to challenge inertia, inefficiency, or complacency.

### Contributions to the Team

1. **Driving Force**: Shapers act as a catalyzing force, driving themselves and others to achieve goals. They are effective in kick-starting a team that may lack focus or momentum.
2. **Conflict Resolution**: They do not shy away from confronting conflicts; instead, they bring issues to the surface and stimulate discussions to resolve them, ensuring that the team's progress is not hindered by unresolved disputes.
3. **Adapting to Challenges**: Shapers are adaptable and can think on their feet, which is crucial in rapidly changing environments where quick thinking and decisiveness are required.

### Allowable Weaknesses

Despite their significant contributions, Shapers also come with potential weaknesses:
- **Prone to Provocation**: Their aggressive drive can sometimes provoke and offend others, potentially leading to interpersonal conflicts.
- **Impatience**: Shapers may exhibit impatience with those who exhibit indecisiveness or a lack of progress, which can demoralize some team members.
- **Insensitivity**: In their push to achieve goals, Shapers can sometimes be seen as insensitive to others’ feelings or reactions, focusing more on results than on people.

### Managing a Shaper

To maximize the effectiveness of a Shaper, it is crucial to:
- Channel their energy productively by setting challenging targets and providing them with authority to lead in crisis situations.
- Encourage them to develop interpersonal skills, particularly in understanding and navigating the dynamics of team interactions.
- Provide them with feedback on their style and its impact on others, helping them refine their approach to be more inclusive while still being effective.

### Ideal Scenarios for Shapers

Shapers are particularly valuable in roles where strong leadership is required to drive change or navigate through challenges. They excel in startup environments, turnaround situations, and any setting where a project or team needs a clear direction and strong push to overcome complacency or inertia.

In summary, the Shaper role in Belbin’s model is crucial for generating momentum and leading a team towards achieving tough goals. Their ability to handle pressure and challenge the status quo can significantly influence a team’s ability to succeed, especially in competitive or challenging environments.
