# Schelling Segregation Model

The **Schelling segregation model** is a [[agent-based model]] introduced by economist [[Thomas Schelling]] in 1971 that demonstrates how individual preferences regarding neighbors can lead to segregation patterns at the population level, even when individuals don't have explicit preferences for segregation.

## Formal Definition

The basic Schelling model consists of:

- A grid (typically two-dimensional) representing a spatial environment
- Agents of different types (often two types, represented as ⬤ and ◯)
- Empty cells (□) where agents can move
- A satisfaction rule based on the composition of each agent's neighborhood

The model evolves according to the following rules:

1. Initialize agents of different types randomly on the grid, leaving some cells empty
2. For each agent, compute a satisfaction metric based on the composition of its neighborhood
3. If an agent is dissatisfied, it moves to a random empty cell
4. Repeat steps 2-3 until reaching a stable configuration or maximum iterations

## Mathematical Formalism

Let's define:
- Grid: $G = \{(i,j) | 1 \leq i,j \leq N\}$ for an $N \times N$ grid
- State: $S: G \rightarrow \{0, 1, 2\}$ where 0 represents empty, 1 and 2 represent different agent types
- Neighborhood of cell $(i,j)$: $\mathcal{N}(i,j) = \{(k,l) \in G | d((i,j), (k,l)) \leq r\}$ where $d$ is a distance metric and $r$ is the neighborhood radius

For an agent of type $t$ at position $(i,j)$, define the satisfaction function:

$$\text{Sat}(i,j) = \frac{\sum_{(k,l) \in \mathcal{N}(i,j)} \mathbf{1}[S(k,l) = S(i,j)]}{|\{(k,l) \in \mathcal{N}(i,j) | S(k,l) \neq 0\}|}$$

where $\mathbf{1}[\cdot]$ is the indicator function. An agent is satisfied if $\text{Sat}(i,j) \geq \tau$, where $\tau \in [0,1]$ is the tolerance threshold.

## Variants and Extensions

### Bounded Neighborhood Model

Instead of a spatial grid, agents belong to discrete neighborhoods (e.g., city districts). Each agent decides whether to stay or leave based on the composition of their current neighborhood.

### Preference Functions

The basic model uses a threshold rule, but more sophisticated models employ continuous preference functions:

$$U(i,j) = f\left(\frac{\sum_{(k,l) \in \mathcal{N}(i,j)} \mathbf{1}[S(k,l) = S(i,j)]}{|\{(k,l) \in \mathcal{N}(i,j) | S(k,l) \neq 0\}|}\right)$$

where $f: [0,1] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ maps composition ratios to utility.

### Multi-type Models

Extensions with more than two types of agents explore more complex segregation dynamics:

$$\text{Sat}_t(i,j) = \sum_{t' \in T} w_{t,t'} \cdot \frac{\sum_{(k,l) \in \mathcal{N}(i,j)} \mathbf{1}[S(k,l) = t']}{|\{(k,l) \in \mathcal{N}(i,j) | S(k,l) \neq 0\}|}$$

where $T$ is the set of types and $w_{t,t'}$ represents the preference weight that type $t$ assigns to type $t'$.

## Metrics and Analysis

### Segregation Indices

Several metrics quantify the degree of segregation:

1. **Dissimilarity Index**:
   $$D = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left| \frac{a_i}{A} - \frac{b_i}{B} \right|$$
   where $a_i$ and $b_i$ are counts of agents of each type in region $i$, and $A$ and $B$ are total counts.

2. **Exposure/Isolation Index**:
   $$P^*_{AB} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{a_i}{A} \cdot \frac{b_i}{a_i + b_i}$$
   measuring the average neighborhood composition experienced by type A agents.

3. **Entropy-based Index**:
   $$H = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{t_i}{T} \left( E - E_i \right)$$
   where $E$ is the entropy of the overall population composition and $E_i$ is the entropy within region $i$.

### Phase Transitions

The Schelling model exhibits critical behavior as the tolerance threshold $\tau$ changes. For a given population density, there exists a critical threshold $\tau_c$ such that:
- For $\tau < \tau_c$: The system tends toward integrated states
- For $\tau > \tau_c$: The system tends toward segregated states

This phase transition behavior is similar to concepts in [[statistical physics]], particularly [[percolation theory]].

## Computational Implementation

A basic pseudocode implementation:

```
function SchellingSegregate(grid, tolerance, max_iterations):
    iteration = 0
    while iteration < max_iterations:
        moved = False
        for each cell (i,j) in grid:
            if grid[i,j] is not empty:
                agent_type = grid[i,j]
                if Satisfaction(i, j, grid) < tolerance:
                    empty_cells = FindEmptyCells(grid)
                    if empty_cells is not empty:
                        move_to = RandomChoice(empty_cells)
                        grid[move_to] = agent_type
                        grid[i,j] = EMPTY
                        moved = True
        if not moved:
            break
        iteration += 1
    return grid
```

## Theoretical Implications

### Emergent Behavior

The Schelling model demonstrates how [[emergent behavior]] can arise from simple individual rules. Even with tolerance thresholds as high as 0.7 (meaning agents are satisfied with just 30% of neighbors being different), significant segregation patterns emerge.

### Tipping Points

The model exhibits [[tipping points]] where small changes in local composition can trigger cascading relocations, leading to rapid transitions between mixed and segregated states.

### Connection to Game Theory

The model can be reformulated as a [[coordination game]] where agents try to coordinate their location choices based on type preferences, creating multiple Nash equilibria.

## Applications and Extensions

### Urban Segregation

The model has been applied to study residential segregation patterns in cities, incorporating factors such as:
- Housing costs and income inequality
- Transportation networks and accessibility
- School district boundaries

### Social Network Segregation

Extensions to network structures examine segregation in [[social networks]]:
- Nodes represent individuals
- Edges represent social connections
- Rewiring rules replace spatial movement

### Opinion Dynamics

Modified versions study [[opinion polarization]]:
- Continuous opinions replace discrete types
- Influence rules replace movement
- Confirmation bias alters interaction patterns

## Symbolic Notation System

For working with Schelling models, we propose the following notation:

- $G(N,M)$ - An $N \times M$ grid
- $A = \{a_1, a_2, ..., a_n\}$ - Set of agents
- $T = \{t_1, t_2, ..., t_k\}$ - Set of agent types
- $\tau_i$ - Tolerance threshold for agent $i$
- $\mathcal{N}_r(i,j)$ - Neighborhood of radius $r$ around position $(i,j)$
- $S_t$ - State of the system at time $t$
- $\rho$ - Population density (fraction of cells occupied)
- $D(S)$ - Segregation metric for state $S$

## Empirical Validation

Several studies have attempted to validate Schelling's model against real-world data:

1. **Residential Patterns**: Analysis of census data from major cities shows similar clustering patterns to those predicted by the model.

2. **Survey Data**: Studies of stated neighborhood preferences reveal thresholds similar to those producing segregation in the model.

3. **Natural Experiments**: Studies of housing policy changes have confirmed dynamics similar to those in the model.

## Open Problems and Research Directions

1. **Heterogeneous Preferences**: How do varying tolerance thresholds across a population affect segregation dynamics?

2. **Strategic Behavior**: How do forward-looking agents who anticipate future neighborhood changes affect equilibrium patterns?

3. **Institutional Constraints**: How do housing policies, zoning regulations, and lending practices interact with individual preferences?

4. **Integration Interventions**: What policy interventions are most effective at promoting stable integrated communities?

5. **Dynamical Analysis**: Can we derive closed-form solutions for the long-term behavior of Schelling-type systems?
