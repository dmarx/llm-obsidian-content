### Visual Cache

**Definition:** The visual cache is a subcomponent of the [[Visuo-Spatial Sketchpad]] within [[Baddeley's Model of Working Memory]]. It is responsible for the temporary storage of visual information such as shapes, colors, and patterns. The visual cache operates as a passive store, holding static visual data for short durations.

### Function and Characteristics

#### Storage

The visual cache holds visual information that is immediately acquired from sensory input or retrieved from long-term memory. Unlike the inner scribe, which actively processes and manipulates spatial data, the visual cache simply retains visual details without actively altering them.

**Example:** When you see a painting and close your eyes, the image of the painting that you "see" in your mind's eye is maintained by the visual cache.

#### Capacity and Duration

The capacity of the visual cache is limited, typically allowing for the storage of a few items at a time. The duration for which information can be held is also brief, usually lasting only a few seconds unless actively rehearsed or encoded into long-term memory.

### Empirical Evidence

#### Studies and Experiments

Several experiments have investigated the capacity and function of the visual cache:

1. **Change Detection Tasks:** Participants are shown an array of visual items (e.g., colored squares) and then, after a brief interval, are shown a second array. They must determine if any items have changed. Performance declines as the number of items increases, indicating the limited capacity of the visual cache.

2. **Dual-Task Paradigms:** Participants perform a primary visual memory task (e.g., remembering a complex image) while simultaneously engaging in a secondary task (e.g., a spatial task involving the inner scribe). If the secondary task does not interfere with the primary visual task, it suggests that the tasks rely on different components of the visuo-spatial sketchpad.

### Mathematical Modeling

To quantify the capacity of the visual cache, we can use a basic model where the number of visual items ($n$) that can be stored is limited by a capacity constant ($k_{\text{visual}}$):

$$
n \leq k_{\text{visual}}
$$

If the visual information decays over time ($t$), the probability of correctly recalling an item ($P$) can be modeled as:

$$
P(t) = P_0 \cdot e^{-\lambda t}
$$

where $P_0$ is the initial probability of correct recall and $\lambda$ is the decay rate.

### Interactions with Other Components

The visual cache interacts with other components of working memory, such as the [[Central Executive]] and the [[Episodic Buffer]]:

- **Central Executive:** Directs attention and coordinates the use of the visual cache for tasks that require visual information.
- **Episodic Buffer:** Integrates visual information from the visual cache with other types of information (e.g., verbal information from the [[Phonological Loop]]) to form integrated episodic memories.

### Applications and Implications

Understanding the visual cache has several practical applications:

- **Education:** Strategies for teaching subjects that rely heavily on visual information (e.g., geometry, art) can be optimized by considering the capacity and limitations of the visual cache.
- **Neuropsychology:** Diagnosing and treating visual memory impairments, such as those resulting from brain injuries or neurodegenerative diseases, can be informed by knowledge of the visual cache.
- **Design:** User interface design can benefit from an understanding of how much visual information users can effectively process and remember, leading to more effective visual presentations.
