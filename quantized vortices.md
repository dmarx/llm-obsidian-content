quantized vortices


**ASSISTANT**

**Quantized vortices** are a fundamental feature of superfluids and superconductors, where they arise due to the quantized nature of circulation in a macroscopic quantum state. In a superfluid, quantized vortices are topological defects around which the phase of the macroscopic wavefunction winds by integer multiples of $2\pi$, leading to quantized values of angular momentum and circulation. This quantization results from the wavefunction's phase coherence across the superfluid, constraining how it can vary in space.

Quantized vortices were first observed in superfluid helium ($^4$He and $^3$He) and later in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) of ultracold atomic gases, where they appear as cores of circulating flow in which superfluid density drops to zero. Vortex formation is also seen in superconductors, where they correspond to quantized magnetic flux lines. Here we’ll focus on quantized vortices in superfluids, examining their mathematical properties, formation mechanisms, and physical significance.

### Mathematical Formulation of Quantized Vortices

In a superfluid, the flow velocity $\mathbf{v}$ is derived from the gradient of the phase $\theta$ of the macroscopic wavefunction $\Psi = \sqrt{\rho} e^{i\theta}$, where $\rho$ is the superfluid density:
$$
\mathbf{v} = \frac{\hbar}{m} \nabla \theta.
$$
Since the wavefunction $\Psi$ is single-valued, the phase $\theta$ must return to its original value after completing a loop around a closed path enclosing a vortex. This quantization condition is represented mathematically by requiring that the circulation around any closed loop $C$ is quantized:
$$
\oint_C \mathbf{v} \cdot d\mathbf{l} = \frac{\hbar}{m} \oint_C \nabla \theta \cdot d\mathbf{l} = \frac{2\pi \hbar}{m} n,
$$
where $n$ is an integer, known as the **winding number** or **topological charge** of the vortex. This quantized circulation means that the angular momentum in the superfluid around the vortex core is constrained to discrete values, preventing any smooth, continuous change in circulation.

### Physical Properties of Quantized Vortices

1. **Core Structure**: At the center of a quantized vortex, the superfluid density $\rho$ drops to zero. This region, called the **vortex core**, is where the phase of $\Psi$ becomes undefined, allowing a $2\pi$ phase winding around the core without violating the single-valued condition. The size of the vortex core is determined by the healing length $\xi$, which defines the length scale over which the density recovers to its bulk value.

2. **Quantized Circulation**: The velocity of the superfluid around a vortex decreases inversely with the distance from the core:
   $$
   v(r) = \frac{\hbar}{m r},
   $$
   where $r$ is the radial distance from the vortex core. This velocity profile leads to rotational flow patterns without dissipation, although the rapid rotation near the core is stabilized by the quantization of circulation.

3. **Vortex Lattices**: When a superfluid rotates, it cannot exhibit continuous rotation like a classical fluid. Instead, it forms a **vortex lattice** with regularly spaced quantized vortices that collectively produce the rotational effect. In rotating Bose-Einstein condensates and superfluid helium, these vortices arrange themselves in a triangular lattice pattern to minimize the system's energy.

### Dynamics of Quantized Vortices

The dynamics of quantized vortices can be described using the **Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE)**, a nonlinear Schrödinger equation for the macroscopic wavefunction $\Psi$ of the superfluid. The GPE naturally supports vortex solutions with quantized circulation, where the density $|\Psi|^2$ vanishes at the vortex core. Interactions between vortices lead to complex dynamics, as vortices can attract or repel each other depending on their relative winding numbers.

#### Vortex-Antivortex Pairs
Vortices with opposite circulation (positive and negative $n$ values) form **vortex-antivortex pairs**. These pairs exhibit attractive interactions and can eventually annihilate each other, releasing energy back into the fluid.

#### Kelvin Waves and Vortex Reconnections
In superfluids, vortices can support **Kelvin waves**—oscillations along the vortex line that can propagate along its length. When two vortices come into close proximity, they can undergo **vortex reconnections**, where they reconnect and exchange segments. This process is central to **quantum turbulence**, a chaotic tangle of quantized vortices that mimics classical turbulence at certain scales.

### Experimental Observations and Significance

Quantized vortices are a direct manifestation of the quantum nature of superfluids and have been observed in experiments with rotating superfluid helium and Bose-Einstein condensates. Their study has significant implications in fields like condensed matter physics and quantum computation. Vortex lattices in BECs, for instance, provide a macroscopic window into topological and quantum-mechanical phenomena, while vortex dynamics and quantum turbulence reveal fundamental aspects of non-equilibrium quantum systems. In superconductors, the concept of quantized vortices forms the basis for understanding magnetic flux quantization and the behavior of **Type-II superconductors** in magnetic fields.

In summary, quantized vortices in superfluids are coherent topological structures with discrete circulation values. They are fundamental to understanding superfluidity, as they provide a unique interplay between quantum mechanics and fluid dynamics.
