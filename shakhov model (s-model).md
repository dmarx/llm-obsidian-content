Shakhov Model (S-Model)


**ASSISTANT**

The **Shakhov model (S-model)** is an extension of the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) model in kinetic theory, designed to better capture the behavior of gases, particularly in scenarios where heat flux is important. The S-model was introduced by E.M. Shakhov in 1968 to address some of the limitations of the BGK model, specifically its inability to accurately reproduce the correct Prandtl number for gases, which affects the simulation of thermal conductivity and heat transfer in rarefied gas flows.

### 1. **Background and Motivation**

The **Boltzmann equation** is the fundamental equation in kinetic theory, describing the statistical distribution of particles in a gas. Solving the full Boltzmann equation is complex, especially due to the nonlinear nature of the collision term. The BGK model simplifies this by approximating the collision term with a single relaxation time model, which relaxes the distribution function towards a local Maxwellian equilibrium.

However, the BGK model has some limitations:

- **Prandtl Number Issue**: The BGK model inherently predicts a Prandtl number (\(Pr\)) of 1, whereas for a monatomic ideal gas, the correct Prandtl number is about \( \frac{2}{3} \). This discrepancy leads to inaccuracies in the prediction of heat flux and thermal conductivity in simulations involving temperature gradients.

The **Shakhov model** was developed to overcome this limitation by modifying the equilibrium distribution function to better account for the heat flux, thereby allowing for the correct Prandtl number.

### 2. **The Shakhov Model (S-Model)**

In the Shakhov model, the collision term in the Boltzmann equation is modified to include an additional term that accounts for the deviation of the distribution function from the Maxwellian equilibrium, particularly to correct the heat flux:

$$
\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}\right)_{\text{coll}} = -\frac{1}{\tau} \left[ f(\boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{v}, t) - f^{(S)}(\boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{v}, t) \right],
$$

where:
- \( f^{(S)} \) is the **Shakhov equilibrium distribution function**, which modifies the standard Maxwellian distribution to include a term that corrects the Prandtl number.

### 3. **Shakhov Equilibrium Distribution Function**

The Shakhov distribution function \( f^{(S)} \) is defined as:

$$
f^{(S)} = f^{(0)} \left[ 1 + (1 - Pr) \frac{\boldsymbol{q} \cdot \boldsymbol{v}}{p (\theta + 1/2) R T} \left(\frac{m |\boldsymbol{v} - \boldsymbol{u}|^2}{2k_B T} - \theta - 1\right) \right],
$$

where:
- \( f^{(0)} \) is the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution function.
- \( Pr \) is the Prandtl number.
- \( \boldsymbol{q} \) is the heat flux vector.
- \( p \) is the pressure.
- \( \theta \) is a parameter related to the specific heat ratio (\( \gamma = 1 + \frac{2}{3\theta} \)) for monatomic gases.
- \( \boldsymbol{v} \) is the particle velocity.
- \( \boldsymbol{u} \) is the macroscopic flow velocity.
- \( T \) is the temperature.
- \( m \) is the mass of a gas particle.
- \( R \) is the specific gas constant.
- \( k_B \) is the Boltzmann constant.

### 4. **Key Features and Advantages**

#### **Correct Prandtl Number**
- The primary advantage of the Shakhov model is its ability to reproduce the correct Prandtl number for a given gas, addressing the limitation of the BGK model. This leads to more accurate predictions of thermal conductivity and heat transfer in non-equilibrium gas flows.

#### **Improved Heat Flux Representation**
- The Shakhov model includes a correction term specifically designed to capture the correct behavior of heat flux in the presence of temperature gradients, which is critical in many applications involving rarefied gases.

#### **Moderate Complexity**
- While the Shakhov model is more complex than the BGK model due to the additional term, it remains significantly simpler than the full Boltzmann equation. This balance of complexity and accuracy makes it a practical choice for many simulations.

### 5. **Applications of the Shakhov Model**

The Shakhov model is used in various applications where accurate modeling of thermal effects and non-equilibrium gas dynamics is important:

#### **Rarefied Gas Flows**
- **Microfluidics**: In microfluidic devices, where the Knudsen number can be significant, the correct representation of thermal effects and heat flux is crucial for accurate modeling of gas flows.
- **High-Altitude Aerodynamics**: For vehicles operating at high altitudes, where rarefied gas effects are significant, the Shakhov model helps in accurately predicting aerodynamic forces and heat transfer.

#### **Thermal Flows**
- **Heat Transfer Simulations**: The Shakhov model is used to simulate heat transfer in gases, particularly in scenarios involving large temperature gradients where the correct Prandtl number is essential.
- **Plasma Physics**: In some plasma simulations, the Shakhov model can be adapted to better capture the behavior of heat flux in the plasma.

### 6. **Challenges and Limitations**

While the Shakhov model addresses some of the limitations of the BGK model, it also has its own challenges:

- **Increased Computational Cost**: The additional term in the Shakhov model adds complexity to the computation, making simulations slightly more expensive than those using the BGK model.
- **Applicability**: The Shakhov model is primarily designed for monatomic gases. For polyatomic gases or more complex molecular interactions, further modifications or different models may be necessary.
- **Parameter Tuning**: The model introduces additional parameters that may require careful tuning or calibration against experimental data to ensure accurate results.

### 7. **Conclusion**

The Shakhov model (S-model) is an important extension of the BGK model in kinetic theory, specifically designed to address the limitations related to the Prandtl number and heat flux representation. By modifying the equilibrium distribution function, the Shakhov model provides more accurate predictions of thermal conductivity and heat transfer in rarefied gas flows, making it valuable for simulations in microfluidics, high-altitude aerodynamics, and other applications where non-equilibrium effects are significant. Despite its added complexity, the Shakhov model strikes a useful balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, making it a widely used tool in the field of [[rarefied gas dynamics]].
