### Reflective Thinking and Metacognition

**Reflective Thinking** and **Metacognition** are interrelated cognitive processes that involve [[self-awareness]] and self-regulation of one's own thinking and learning. These processes are crucial for effective problem-solving, decision-making, and lifelong learning.

#### Reflective Thinking

**Reflective Thinking** is the process of actively and thoughtfully considering one’s own experiences, thoughts, and actions. It involves evaluating past experiences to gain insights, improve understanding, and inform future actions.

2. **Characteristics**:
   - **Self-Examination**: Analyzing one's thoughts, feelings, and actions.
   - **Critical Analysis**: Evaluating the reasons behind one's thoughts and actions.
   - **Insight Development**: Gaining new perspectives and understanding.
   - **Future Planning**: Using insights to guide future actions and decisions.

3. **Benefits**:
   - **Improved Learning**: Enhances understanding and retention of information.
   - **Personal Growth**: Promotes [[self-awareness]] and personal development.
   - **Better Decision-Making**: Informs more thoughtful and informed decisions.
   - **Enhanced Problem-Solving**: Helps identify and correct mistakes.

4. **Techniques**:
