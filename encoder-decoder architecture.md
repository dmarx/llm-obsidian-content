Encoder-Decoder Architecture


**ASSISTANT**

The encoder-decoder architecture is a foundational model in sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) learning, particularly well-suited for tasks where input and output sequences can be of different lengths. This architecture underpins many applications in natural language processing, machine translation, speech recognition, and more. Here's a detailed explanation of its components, working mechanism, and mathematical formalism.

## Key Components

### Encoder
The encoder processes the input sequence and converts it into a fixed-length context vector (also called a thought vector). This context vector captures the essential information of the input sequence. Typically, the encoder is implemented using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), or Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU).

#### Encoder Steps:
1. **Input Sequence**: \( X = (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{T_x}) \)
2. **Hidden States**: The encoder processes each element \( x_t \) of the input sequence and maintains a hidden state \( h_t \) that captures information up to time step \( t \):

$$
h_t = f(x_t, h_{t-1})
$$

where \( f \) is the recurrence function of the RNN, LSTM, or GRU.

3. **Context Vector**: The final hidden state \( h_{T_x} \) (or a combination of all hidden states) serves as the context vector \( c \), summarizing the entire input sequence.

### Decoder
The decoder generates the output sequence from the context vector. Like the encoder, the decoder is usually implemented with an RNN, LSTM, or GRU. At each time step, the decoder predicts the next element of the output sequence based on the context vector and the previously generated elements.

#### Decoder Steps:
1. **Initial State**: The initial hidden state of the decoder is usually set to the context vector \( c \).
2. **Output Sequence**: The decoder generates the output sequence \( Y = (y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_{T_y}) \) one element at a time:

$$
s_t = g(y_{t-1}, s_{t-1}, c)
$$

where \( g \) is the recurrence function of the decoder, and \( s_t \) is the hidden state at time step \( t \).

3. **Prediction**: At each time step, the decoder produces a probability distribution over the possible output tokens, from which the next token \( y_t \) is sampled or chosen:

$$
y_t = \arg\max \text{Softmax}(W s_t + b)
$$

### Attention Mechanism
The attention mechanism improves the basic encoder-decoder architecture by allowing the decoder to focus on different parts of the input sequence at each decoding step. Instead of using a single context vector, the decoder computes a weighted sum of the encoder's hidden states, where the weights reflect the relevance of each hidden state to the current decoding step.

#### Attention Steps:
1. **Alignment Scores**: Compute alignment scores \( e_{ij} \) between the decoder's hidden state \( s_{i-1} \) and each encoder hidden state \( h_j \):

$$
e_{ij} = \text{score}(s_{i-1}, h_j)
$$

2. **Attention Weights**: Normalize the alignment scores using a softmax function to obtain attention weights \( \alpha_{ij} \):

$$
\alpha_{ij} = \frac{\exp(e_{ij})}{\sum_{k=1}^{T_x} \exp(e_{ik})}
$$

3. **Context Vector**: Compute the context vector \( c_i \) for each decoder time step as a weighted sum of the encoder hidden states:

$$
c_i = \sum_{j=1}^{T_x} \alpha_{ij} h_j
$$

4. **Decoding**: Use the context vector \( c_i \) along with the previous decoder hidden state \( s_{i-1} \) to generate the next hidden state and output:

$$
s_i = g(y_{i-1}, s_{i-1}, c_i)
$$

## Mathematical Formalism

### Encoder
For an input sequence \( X = (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{T_x}) \), the encoder's hidden states are computed as:

$$
h_t = f(x_t, h_{t-1})
$$

where \( f \) is the recurrence function of an RNN, LSTM, or GRU. The final hidden state \( h_{T_x} \) is used as the context vector \( c \).

### Decoder
The decoder's hidden states and outputs are generated as:

$$
s_t = g(y_{t-1}, s_{t-1}, c)
$$

$$
y_t = \arg\max \text{Softmax}(W s_t + b)
$$

where \( g \) is the recurrence function of the decoder, and \( y_t \) is the predicted output token at time step \( t \).

### Attention Mechanism
The alignment scores, attention weights, and context vector are computed as:

$$
e_{ij} = \text{score}(s_{i-1}, h_j)
$$

$$
\alpha_{ij} = \frac{\exp(e_{ij})}{\sum_{k=1}^{T_x} \exp(e_{ik})}
$$

$$
c_i = \sum_{j=1}^{T_x} \alpha_{ij} h_j
$$

The decoder then generates the next hidden state and output using the context vector \( c_i \):

$$
s_i = g(y_{i-1}, s_{i-1}, c_i)
$$

## Applications

### Machine Translation
Transforming sentences from one language to another. For example, translating English sentences to French sentences.

### Text Summarization
Converting a long document or article into a concise summary while preserving the main information.

### Speech Recognition
Converting spoken language into written text. For example, transcribing audio recordings of spoken words into text.

### Question Answering
Generating answers to questions based on a given context or document. For instance, creating responses to user queries in a chatbot.

## Conclusion
The encoder-decoder architecture is a versatile and powerful framework for sequence-to-sequence learning. It effectively handles tasks where input and output sequences vary in length and structure. Enhancements like the attention mechanism further improve its performance by allowing the model to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence during decoding.
