**USER**

who introduced MAC theory


**ASSISTANT**

The "Morality as Cooperation" (MAC) theory was prominently developed and introduced by researchers led by Dr. Oliver Scott Curry. Dr. Curry is an evolutionary anthropologist and senior researcher at the Institute of Cognitive and Evolutionary Anthropology at the University of Oxford. He has significantly contributed to formalizing and popularizing the idea that human morality evolved to promote various forms of cooperation.

Dr. Curry's work synthesizes findings from evolutionary biology, game theory, and anthropology to propose that moral behaviors and norms can be understood as solutions to cooperation problems faced by humans throughout their evolutionary history. His research and publications on this topic have helped establish the MAC theory as a robust framework for understanding the origins and functions of morality.

### Key Contributions

1. **Evolutionary Foundation**: Dr. Curry has emphasized the role of evolutionary pressures in shaping moral behaviors that enhance cooperation among individuals and groups.

2. **Typology of Cooperation**: He has categorized different types of cooperation (e.g., kin selection, mutualism, reciprocal altruism) and linked them to corresponding moral norms and behaviors.

3. **Empirical Studies**: Through cross-cultural research and experimental studies, Dr. Curry and his colleagues have demonstrated the universality and variability of moral norms across societies, supporting the idea that these norms are adaptive solutions to cooperation problems.

4. **Interdisciplinary Approach**: Dr. Curryâ€™s work integrates insights from multiple disciplines, providing a comprehensive and multifaceted understanding of morality as a product of cooperative evolution.

### Major Publications

One of Dr. Curry's notable papers is:

- **"Morality as Cooperation: A Problem-Centred Approach" (2016)**: In this paper, Curry outlines the theoretical framework of MAC, detailing how moral norms can be seen as solutions to specific types of cooperation problems.

Dr. Curry's contributions have been instrumental in advancing the MAC theory and promoting a scientific understanding of morality that bridges evolutionary biology, psychology, and cultural anthropology.
