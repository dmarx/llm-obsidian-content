### Quadratic Forms

A **quadratic form** is a polynomial with terms all of degree two in a number of variables. In linear algebra, quadratic forms play a significant role in understanding the properties of symmetric matrices and the geometries of the spaces they describe.

#### Formal Definition

A quadratic form in $n$ variables $\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)^T$ over a field $F$ (usually the real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ or complex numbers $\mathbb{C}$) is an expression of the form:
$$
Q(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij} x_i x_j
$$
where $a_{ij} = a_{ji}$ for all $i$ and $j$. This can be compactly written using matrix notation as:
$$
Q(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{x}^T A \mathbf{x}
$$
where $A$ is an $n \times n$ symmetric matrix with entries $a_{ij}$.

#### Matrix Representation

Given a quadratic form $Q(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{x}^T A \mathbf{x}$, the matrix $A$ is symmetric, meaning $A = A^T$. The properties of the quadratic form are closely tied to the properties of the matrix $A$.

#### Diagonalization

A quadratic form can often be simplified by diagonalizing the matrix $A$. If $A$ can be diagonalized, there exists an orthogonal matrix $P$ such that:
$$
P^T A P = D
$$
where $D$ is a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues of $A$ on the diagonal. The quadratic form then becomes:
$$
Q(\mathbf{y}) = \mathbf{y}^T D \mathbf{y}
$$
where $\mathbf{y} = P^T \mathbf{x}$. This transformation helps in classifying the quadratic form based on the signs of the eigenvalues of $A$.

#### Classification by Signature

The **signature** of a quadratic form is the triplet $(n_+, n_-, n_0)$ where:
- $n_+$ is the number of positive eigenvalues of $A$,
- $n_-$ is the number of negative eigenvalues of $A$,
- $n_0$ is the number of zero eigenvalues of $A$.

Sylvester's Law of Inertia states that the signature of a quadratic form is invariant under congruent transformations.

#### Positive Definite and Indefinite Forms

- A quadratic form $Q(\mathbf{x})$ is **positive definite** if $Q(\mathbf{x}) > 0$ for all $\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{0}$. This occurs if and only if all eigenvalues of $A$ are positive.
- A quadratic form $Q(\mathbf{x})$ is **negative definite** if $Q(\mathbf{x}) < 0$ for all $\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{0}$. This occurs if and only if all eigenvalues of $A$ are negative.
- A quadratic form $Q(\mathbf{x})$ is **indefinite** if it takes on both positive and negative values, which occurs when $A$ has both positive and negative eigenvalues.

#### Canonical Forms

Through diagonalization, a quadratic form can often be reduced to a sum of squares (or difference of squares) which is easier to analyze. For example, for real symmetric matrices, this reduction takes the form:
$$
Q(\mathbf{x}) = \lambda_1 y_1^2 + \lambda_2 y_2^2 + \ldots + \lambda_n y_n^2
$$
where $\lambda_i$ are the eigenvalues of $A$ and $y_i$ are the transformed variables.

#### Examples

1. **Simple Example**: Consider the quadratic form in two variables $x_1$ and $x_2$:
   $$
   Q(x_1, x_2) = 3x_1^2 + 2x_1 x_2 + x_2^2
   $$
   The corresponding matrix $A$ is:
   $$
   A = \begin{pmatrix}
   3 & 1 \\
   1 & 1
   \end{pmatrix}
   $$
   Diagonalizing $A$ will yield a new representation that highlights the nature of the quadratic form.

2. **Elliptic Paraboloid**: The quadratic form $Q(x_1, x_2, x_3) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 - x_3^2$ corresponds to a saddle shape, indicating an indefinite quadratic form since it has both positive and negative eigenvalues.

### Applications

- **Optimization**: Quadratic forms appear in the study of convex optimization problems where the objective function is quadratic.
- **Physics**: In physics, particularly in the theory of relativity and in the study of inertia tensors, quadratic forms are used to describe energy and metric tensors.
- **Statistics**: In statistics, quadratic forms are involved in the analysis of variance and the estimation of parameters in linear models.
