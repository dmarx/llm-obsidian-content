Core of a Cooperative Game

### Core of a Cooperative Game

The **core** of a cooperative game is a fundamental concept that describes a set of imputations (distributions of total payoff) where no coalition of players would benefit from deviating and forming a separate coalition. Essentially, the core ensures stability by guaranteeing that every coalition receives at least as much as it could achieve on its own.

#### Definition

Given a cooperative game $(N, v)$ where $N$ is the set of players and $v: 2^N \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is the characteristic function:

- **Imputation**: A vector $x = (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)$ is called an imputation if it satisfies:
  1. **Efficiency**: $\sum_{i \in N} x_i = v(N)$.
  2. **Individual Rationality**: $x_i \geq v(\{i\})$ for all $i \in N$.

- **Core**: The core $C(v)$ is the set of all imputations $x$ that satisfy the following condition for every coalition $S \subseteq N$:
  $$ \sum_{i \in S} x_i \geq v(S). $$

Formally,
$$ C(v) = \left\{ x \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid \sum_{i \in N} x_i = v(N) \text{ and } \sum_{i \in S} x_i \geq v(S) \text{ for all } S \subseteq N \right\}. $$

#### Interpretation

The core represents the set of possible payoffs that ensure no subset of players (coalition) would prefer to break away from the grand coalition $N$ because they would receive a lower payoff than $v(S)$.

#### Example

Consider a cooperative game with three players $N = \{1, 2, 3\}$ and the characteristic function defined as follows:
$$
\begin{align*}
v(\{1\}) & = 0, \\
v(\{2\}) & = 0, \\
v(\{3\}) & = 0, \\
v(\{1, 2\}) & = 100, \\
v(\{1, 3\}) & = 100, \\
v(\{2, 3\}) & = 100, \\
v(\{1, 2, 3\}) & = 120.
\end{align*}
$$

To find the core, we need to determine the set of imputations $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ satisfying:

1. Efficiency:
   $$ x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 120. $$

2. Group Rationality (for every coalition $S \subseteq N$):
   $$ x_1 + x_2 \geq 100, $$
   $$ x_1 + x_3 \geq 100, $$
   $$ x_2 + x_3 \geq 100. $$

We can solve these inequalities as follows:

- From the efficiency condition: 
  $$ x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 120. $$

- For $x_1 + x_2 \geq 100$:
  $$ x_3 \leq 20. $$

- For $x_1 + x_3 \geq 100$:
  $$ x_2 \leq 20. $$

- For $x_2 + x_3 \geq 100$:
  $$ x_1 \leq 20. $$

Therefore, any imputation $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ in the core must satisfy:
$$ x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 120, $$
$$ x_1 \leq 20, \quad x_2 \leq 20, \quad x_3 \leq 20. $$

#### Graphical Representation

If we consider a coordinate system where $x_1, x_2, x_3$ are axes, the core can be visualized as the intersection of the plane $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 120$ with the region defined by $x_1, x_2, x_3 \leq 20$. This results in a bounded region within the plane, indicating the feasible distributions of the total payoff that keep all coalitions at least as well off as they would be on their own.

#### Properties

1. **Non-emptiness**: The core is not always non-empty. It is non-empty if there exists at least one imputation that satisfies the efficiency and group rationality conditions for all coalitions.

2. **Convexity**: The core is a convex set because it is defined by linear inequalities.

3. **Balancedness**: A game is balanced if every balanced collection of coalitions can achieve at least their worth. A game has a non-empty core if and only if it is balanced.
