automorphic forms


**ASSISTANT**

Automorphic forms are a central concept in number theory and the Langlands program, linking representation theory, harmonic analysis, and algebraic geometry. They generalize classical modular forms and have deep connections to many areas of mathematics, including arithmetic geometry, spectral theory, and the theory of $L$-functions.

### Definition and Basic Properties

Automorphic forms are functions defined on the adelic points of a reductive algebraic group that satisfy specific invariance and growth conditions. Let $G$ be a reductive algebraic group over a global field $K$ (which can be either a number field or a function field). The adelic points of $G$ are denoted by $G(\mathbb{A})$, where $\mathbb{A}$ is the ring of adeles of $K$.

An automorphic form on $G$ is a smooth function $f: G(K) \backslash G(\mathbb{A}) \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ satisfying:

1. **Invariance**: For a compact open subgroup $K_f \subset G(\mathbb{A}_f)$, $f(gk) = f(g)$ for all $g \in G(\mathbb{A})$ and $k \in K_f$, where $G(\mathbb{A}_f)$ denotes the finite adeles.
2. **Moderate Growth**: The function $f$ grows at most polynomially in a suitable sense.
3. **Eigenfunction of Hecke Operators**: $f$ is an eigenfunction under the action of Hecke operators, which are defined via double coset decompositions involving the adelic points.

### Classical Modular Forms as Automorphic Forms

To see how automorphic forms generalize classical modular forms, consider the case $G = GL_2$ and $K = \mathbb{Q}$. Classical modular forms are functions on the upper half-plane $\mathbb{H}$ that are invariant under the action of $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ up to a character, with specific transformation properties under the action of $SL_2(\mathbb{R})$.

In the automorphic form framework, a classical modular form can be viewed as a function on $GL_2(\mathbb{Q}) \backslash GL_2(\mathbb{A})$ that transforms in a specific way under the action of $GL_2(\mathbb{A})$.

### Automorphic Representations

Automorphic forms give rise to automorphic representations. An automorphic representation is an irreducible subrepresentation of the space of automorphic forms under the right regular action of $G(\mathbb{A})$. This space is decomposed into a direct sum or integral of irreducible representations, each of which corresponds to an automorphic representation.

### Hecke Operators and $L$-functions

Hecke operators play a crucial role in the theory of automorphic forms. These operators are defined by convolutions with characteristic functions of double cosets and act on spaces of automorphic forms. Automorphic forms that are eigenfunctions of all Hecke operators are of particular interest.

The eigenvalues of Hecke operators are related to $L$-functions, which are generating functions encoding arithmetic information. For an automorphic form $f$, its associated $L$-function is defined by a Dirichlet series:
$$
L(s, f) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{a_n}{n^s},
$$
where the coefficients $a_n$ are derived from the Hecke eigenvalues of $f$. These $L$-functions satisfy functional equations and have deep connections to the arithmetic properties of $f$.

### Example: Cusp Forms

Cusp forms are a specific type of automorphic form with rapid decay at cusps (infinite boundary points of a fundamental domain). For $GL_2/\mathbb{Q}$, a cusp form is an automorphic form that vanishes at all cusps. These forms are important in the study of modular forms and the spectral theory of automorphic representations.

### Connection to the Langlands Program

The Langlands Program posits a correspondence between automorphic representations of $G(\mathbb{A})$ and certain Galois representations. This broad and deep conjectural framework connects the representation theory of reductive groups over local and global fields with the arithmetic of Galois groups. The Geometric Langlands Program is a geometric analog of this framework, where automorphic forms are replaced by $\mathcal{D}$-modules and local systems.

### Applications and Further Directions

Automorphic forms and their associated representations have applications in many areas:

- **Arithmetic Geometry**: Understanding the distribution of primes and solutions to polynomial equations.
- **Spectral Theory**: Studying the eigenvalues of the Laplacian on arithmetic quotients.
- **Mathematical Physics**: Connections to string theory and quantum field theory.

The study of automorphic forms is a vast and active area of research, continually revealing new connections and insights across different fields of mathematics. For example, the [[Geometric Langlands Conjecture]] extends these ideas into the realm of algebraic geometry, providing a powerful framework for exploring the deep relationships between geometry, representation theory, and arithmetic.
