residue in [[complex analysis]]


**ASSISTANT**

In [[complex analysis]], the residue of a complex function at a singularity is a crucial concept used in evaluating complex integrals, particularly through the application of the Residue Theorem. The residue captures the behavior of the function near its singularity and plays a vital role in various applications, such as evaluating real integrals and solving problems in physics and engineering.

### Definition

The residue of a function \( f(z) \) at an isolated singularity \( z_0 \) is the coefficient \( a_{-1} \) of the term \((z - z_0)^{-1}\) in the Laurent series expansion of \( f(z) \) around \( z_0 \). 

If \( f(z) \) has a Laurent series expansion around \( z_0 \) given by:
$$
f(z) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} a_n (z - z_0)^n
$$

then the residue \( \text{Res}(f, z_0) \) is:
$$
\text{Res}(f, z_0) = a_{-1}
$$

### Calculation of Residues

Residues can be calculated using various methods depending on the nature of the singularity:

1. **Simple Poles**: If \( z_0 \) is a simple pole (a pole of order 1) of \( f(z) \), then:
   $$
   \text{Res}(f, z_0) = \lim_{z \to z_0} (z - z_0) f(z)
   $$

2. **Poles of Higher Order**: If \( z_0 \) is a pole of order \( n \) of \( f(z) \), then:
   $$
   \text{Res}(f, z_0) = \frac{1}{(n-1)!} \lim_{z \to z_0} \frac{d^{n-1}}{dz^{n-1}} \left[ (z - z_0)^n f(z) \right]
   $$

3. **Laurent Series**: For more complicated cases, expand \( f(z) \) into its Laurent series around \( z_0 \) and identify the coefficient of \((z - z_0)^{-1}\).

### Residue Theorem

The Residue Theorem is a powerful tool in [[complex analysis]] that relates the contour integral of a function around a closed curve to the sum of residues within the enclosed region.

#### Statement

Let \( f(z) \) be a function that is analytic inside and on a simple closed contour \( \gamma \), except for a finite number of isolated singularities \( z_1, z_2, \ldots, z_n \) inside \( \gamma \). Then the contour integral of \( f(z) \) around \( \gamma \) is given by:
$$
\oint_\gamma f(z) \, dz = 2\pi i \sum_{k=1}^{n} \text{Res}(f, z_k)
$$

### Examples

#### Example 1: Simple Pole

Evaluate the integral:
$$
\oint_{|z-1|=1} \frac{e^z}{z-1} \, dz
$$

**Solution**:
1. Identify the singularity: \( z = 1 \) is a simple pole.
2. Compute the residue at \( z = 1 \):
   $$
   \text{Res}\left( \frac{e^z}{z-1}, 1 \right) = \lim_{z \to 1} (z-1) \frac{e^z}{z-1} = e^1 = e
   $$
3. Apply the Residue Theorem:
   $$
   \oint_{|z-1|=1} \frac{e^z}{z-1} \, dz = 2\pi i \cdot e = 2\pi i e
   $$

#### Example 2: Pole of Higher Order

Evaluate the integral:
$$
\oint_{|z|=2} \frac{1}{(z-1)^2 (z+2)} \, dz
$$

**Solution**:
1. Identify the singularities: \( z = 1 \) is a pole of order 2, and \( z = -2 \) is a simple pole.
2. Compute the residue at \( z = 1 \):
   $$
   \text{Res}\left( \frac{1}{(z-1)^2 (z+2)}, 1 \right) = \lim_{z \to 1} \frac{d}{dz} \left[ (z-1)^2 \frac{1}{(z-1)^2 (z+2)} \right] = \lim_{z \to 1} \frac{d}{dz} \left[ \frac{1}{z+2} \right] = \lim_{z \to 1} \left( -\frac{1}{(z+2)^2} \right) = -\frac{1}{9}
   $$
3. Compute the residue at \( z = -2 \):
   $$
   \text{Res}\left( \frac{1}{(z-1)^2 (z+2)}, -2 \right) = \frac{1}{(z-1)^2} \bigg|_{z=-2} = \frac{1}{(-3)^2} = \frac{1}{9}
   $$
4. Apply the Residue Theorem:
   $$
   \oint_{|z|=2} \frac{1}{(z-1)^2 (z+2)} \, dz = 2\pi i \left( -\frac{1}{9} + \frac{1}{9} \right) = 0
   $$

### Applications

1. **Evaluating Real Integrals**: Residues are used to evaluate real integrals, especially those involving trigonometric functions or improper integrals.
2. **Solving Differential Equations**: Residues help in finding solutions to differential equations using methods like the Laplace transform.
3. **Physics and Engineering**: Used in the analysis of wave propagation, quantum mechanics, and electrical circuits.
