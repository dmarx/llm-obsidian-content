Multi-Relaxation-Time (MRT) Models


**ASSISTANT**

**Multi-Relaxation-Time (MRT) models** are an extension of the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) that improve upon the simpler Single-Relaxation-Time (SRT) model, often referred to as the BGK model. In MRT models, the relaxation processes for different moments of the distribution function are treated independently, each with its own relaxation time. This flexibility enhances the stability, accuracy, and physical realism of the LBM, especially for complex and high Reynolds number flows.

### 1. **Background and Motivation**

In the **Single-Relaxation-Time (SRT) LBM** or BGK model, all moments of the distribution function relax towards their equilibrium values at the same rate, governed by a single relaxation time \( \tau \). This simplification can lead to issues such as:

- **Numerical Instability**: Particularly at high Reynolds numbers or with large time steps.
- **Inaccurate Representation**: The physical dissipation rates of different modes (like shear and bulk viscosity) may not be accurately captured.

To address these issues, the **Multi-Relaxation-Time (MRT) model** was developed. The key idea is to allow different moments of the distribution function to relax at different rates, thereby providing greater control over the model's physical and numerical properties.

### 2. **Overview of MRT Models**

In MRT models, the distribution function \( f_i \) is first transformed from velocity space to moment space using a transformation matrix \( \mathbf{M} \). In moment space, different moments (which correspond to macroscopic quantities like density, momentum, stress, etc.) can relax at different rates. After the collision step, the moments are transformed back to velocity space.

#### **Steps in MRT Model**

1. **Transformation to Moment Space**:
   The distribution functions \( f_i \) are mapped to moments \( \mathbf{m} \) using a linear transformation:

   $$
   \mathbf{m} = \mathbf{M} \mathbf{f},
   $$

   where:
   - \( \mathbf{m} = [m_0, m_1, \dots, m_q]^T \) is the vector of moments.
   - \( \mathbf{f} = [f_0, f_1, \dots, f_q]^T \) is the vector of distribution functions.
   - \( \mathbf{M} \) is the transformation matrix, which is chosen based on the specific lattice and problem.

2. **Relaxation in Moment Space**:
   The moments relax towards their equilibrium values \( \mathbf{m}^{(0)} \) at different rates:

   $$
   \mathbf{m}' = \mathbf{m} - \mathbf{S}(\mathbf{m} - \mathbf{m}^{(0)}),
   $$

   where:
   - \( \mathbf{m}' \) is the post-collision moment vector.
   - \( \mathbf{S} \) is the diagonal relaxation matrix, where each diagonal element \( s_i \) corresponds to the inverse of the relaxation time for the \( i \)-th moment: \( s_i = \frac{1}{\tau_i} \).

3. **Transformation Back to Velocity Space**:
   The post-collision moments are transformed back to velocity space:

   $$
   \mathbf{f}' = \mathbf{M}^{-1} \mathbf{m}'.
   $$

   The resulting distribution functions \( f_i' \) are then used in the streaming step of the LBM.

### 3. **Advantages of MRT Models**

MRT models offer several advantages over the simpler SRT models:

- **Improved Numerical Stability**: By allowing different moments to relax at different rates, MRT models can be more stable, especially at high Reynolds numbers or when larger time steps are used.
  
- **Better Physical Accuracy**: MRT models can more accurately represent the physical dissipation of different modes (e.g., bulk viscosity, shear viscosity), leading to more realistic simulations of fluid flows.

- **Enhanced Control**: The ability to tune individual relaxation times provides more control over the numerical diffusion and dispersion characteristics of the simulation, which can be critical for accurately capturing shock waves, boundary layers, and other complex flow features.

### 4. **Common Applications of MRT Models**

MRT models are widely used in various applications of LBM, particularly where stability and accuracy are critical:

- **High Reynolds Number Flows**: In simulating turbulent flows or flows at high Reynolds numbers, MRT models provide the stability needed to avoid numerical artifacts and accurately capture the flow dynamics.

- **Complex Geometries and Boundaries**: MRT models are better suited for simulations involving complex geometries or challenging boundary conditions, such as curved surfaces or porous media.

- **Multiphase Flows**: When simulating flows involving multiple phases (e.g., liquid-gas interactions), MRT models help maintain numerical stability and accuracy, especially when dealing with interfaces and phase transitions.

- **Thermal Flows**: In simulations that involve heat transfer, MRT models can be extended to accurately model energy dissipation and thermal conduction.

### 5. **Implementation Details**

#### **Choice of Moments and Transformation Matrix**
The specific choice of moments and the transformation matrix \( \mathbf{M} \) depends on the lattice used (e.g., D2Q9 for 2D, D3Q19 for 3D). The moments typically include:

- **Conserved Quantities**: Such as mass and momentum, which must remain invariant during collisions.
- **Non-Conserved Quantities**: Such as energy, stress, and higher-order moments, which can relax at different rates.

A common set of moments might include:
- **Density** \( \rho \)
- **Momentum** \( \rho u_x \), \( \rho u_y \)
- **Kinetic Energy** \( e \)
- **Stress Components** \( p_{xx} \), \( p_{yy} \), \( p_{xy} \)
- **Higher-order moments** \( q_x \), \( q_y \), etc.

#### **Relaxation Times**
The relaxation times \( \tau_i \) are chosen based on physical properties of the flow, such as viscosity, and numerical considerations, such as stability criteria. Typically, the relaxation times for conserved quantities are set to infinity (no relaxation), while those for non-conserved quantities are chosen to satisfy the desired physical and numerical properties.

### 6. **Challenges and Considerations**

While MRT models offer significant advantages, they also come with challenges:

- **Complexity**: MRT models are more complex to implement and require careful selection of relaxation times and transformation matrices. This added complexity can make the method more difficult to use and optimize.

- **Computational Cost**: The increased number of relaxation times and the need to transform between velocity and moment spaces can increase the computational cost compared to SRT models.

- **Parameter Tuning**: Finding the optimal relaxation times for different moments can be challenging and may require empirical tuning or iterative testing.

### 7. **Conclusion**

Multi-Relaxation-Time (MRT) models represent an important advancement in the Lattice Boltzmann Method, offering enhanced stability, accuracy, and flexibility over traditional Single-Relaxation-Time models. By allowing different moments of the distribution function to relax at different rates, MRT models can better capture the physical properties of fluid flows, especially in complex or high Reynolds number scenarios. Despite the increased complexity, MRT models are widely used in research and industry for simulations requiring high accuracy and robustness, making them a valuable tool in computational fluid dynamics.
