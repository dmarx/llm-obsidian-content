## Bellman Equations in Reinforcement Learning

### Overview

The Bellman equations are fundamental recursive relationships in [[reinforcement learning]] (RL) that express the value of a state (or state-action pair) in terms of the values of subsequent states. They form the basis for many RL algorithms, including dynamic programming, temporal difference learning, and Q-learning.

### Key Concepts

1. **State Value Function (\(V(s)\))**: Estimates the expected return (cumulative reward) from state \(s\).
2. **Action-Value Function (\(Q(s, a)\))**: Estimates the expected return from state \(s\) taking action \(a\) and thereafter following policy \(\pi\).

### Bellman Equation for State Value Function

The Bellman equation for the state value function \(V^\pi(s)\) under policy \(\pi\) expresses the value of a state as the expected return starting from that state, considering all possible actions and subsequent states:

\[
V^\pi(s) = \mathbb{E}_\pi \left[ R(s, a) + \gamma V^\pi(s') \bigg| s \right]
\]

This can be expanded using the definition of expectation over the policy \(\pi\) and the transition probabilities \(P(s' | s, a)\):

\[
V^\pi(s) = \sum_{a \in A} \pi(a | s) \sum_{s' \in S} P(s' | s, a) \left[ R(s, a, s') + \gamma V^\pi(s') \right]
\]

### Bellman Equation for Action-Value Function

The Bellman equation for the action-value function \(Q^\pi(s, a)\) under policy \(\pi\) expresses the value of a state-action pair as the expected return starting from that state-action pair, considering the immediate reward plus the value of the subsequent state:

\[
Q^\pi(s, a) = \mathbb{E}_\pi \left[ R(s, a) + \gamma Q^\pi(s', a') \bigg| s, a \right]
\]

This can be expanded as:

\[
Q^\pi(s, a) = \sum_{s' \in S} P(s' | s, a) \left[ R(s, a, s') + \gamma \sum_{a' \in A} \pi(a' | s') Q^\pi(s', a') \right]
\]

### Bellman Optimality Equations

For the optimal policy \(\pi^*\), the Bellman optimality equations provide a way to compute the optimal state value function \(V^*(s)\) and the optimal action-value function \(Q^*(s, a)\).

#### Bellman Optimality Equation for State Value Function

\[
V^*(s) = \max_{a \in A} \sum_{s' \in S} P(s' | s, a) \left[ R(s, a, s') + \gamma V^*(s') \right]
\]

#### Bellman Optimality Equation for Action-Value Function

\[
Q^*(s, a) = \sum_{s' \in S} P(s' | s, a) \left[ R(s, a, s') + \gamma \max_{a' \in A} Q^*(s', a') \right]
\]

### Applications of Bellman Equations

1. **Dynamic Programming**: Algorithms like Value Iteration and Policy Iteration use Bellman equations to compute optimal policies.
2. **Temporal Difference Learning**: TD(0), SARSA, and Q-learning use Bellman equations to update value estimates based on observed rewards and predicted future values.
3. **Approximate Dynamic Programming**: Bellman equations are used in approximate methods where exact solutions are infeasible.

### Dynamic Programming Algorithms

#### Value Iteration

Value Iteration is an algorithm that iteratively updates the value function using the Bellman optimality equation until convergence.

1. **Initialization**: Initialize \(V(s)\) arbitrarily (e.g., \(V(s) = 0\) for all \(s\)).
2. **Iteration**: For each state \(s \in S\):
   
   \[
   V(s) \leftarrow \max_{a \in A} \sum_{s' \in S} P(s' | s, a) \left[ R(s, a, s') + \gamma V(s') \right]
   \]
3. **Convergence**: Repeat until \(V\) converges (changes are below a small threshold).

#### Policy Iteration

Policy Iteration consists of two main steps: policy evaluation and policy improvement.

1. **Initialization**: Initialize policy \(\pi\) arbitrarily.
2. **Policy Evaluation**: Compute the value function \(V^\pi\) for the current policy \(\pi\):
   
   \[
   V^\pi(s) = \sum_{a \in A} \pi(a | s) \sum_{s' \in S} P(s' | s, a) \left[ R(s, a, s') + \gamma V^\pi(s') \right]
   \]
3. **Policy Improvement**: Update the policy using the current value function \(V^\pi\):
   
   \[
   \pi(s) \leftarrow \arg\max_{a \in A} \sum_{s' \in S} P(s' | s, a) \left[ R(s, a, s') + \gamma V^\pi(s') \right]
   \]
4. **Convergence**: Repeat policy evaluation and improvement until the policy converges.

### Example: Value Iteration in Python

```python
import numpy as np

# Define the environment
states = [0, 1, 2, 3]
actions = [0, 1]
P = {
    0: {0: [(1.0, 0, 0, True)], 1: [(1.0, 1, 0, True)]},
    1: {0: [(1.0, 0, 0, True)], 1: [(1.0, 2, 1, True)]},
    2: {0: [(1.0, 1, 0, True)], 1: [(1.0, 3, 1, True)]},
    3: {0: [(1.0, 2, 0, True)], 1: [(1.0, 3, 0, True)]},
}
gamma = 0.99

# Initialize value function
V = np.zeros(len(states))

# Value Iteration
for i in range(1000):
    delta = 0
    for s in states:
        v = V[s]
        V[s] = max(sum(p * (r + gamma * V[s_]) for p, s_, r, _ in P[s][a]) for a in actions)
        delta = max(delta, abs(v - V[s]))
    if delta < 1e-6:
        break

print("Optimal Value Function:")
print(V)
```

### Conclusion

The Bellman equations are foundational to [[reinforcement learning]], providing the recursive relationships needed to compute value functions and optimal policies. They are used in various RL algorithms, including dynamic programming methods like Value Iteration and Policy Iteration, and are central to temporal difference learning methods like Q-learning and SARSA. Understanding and applying the Bellman equations is crucial for developing effective RL algorithms and solving complex decision-making problems.
