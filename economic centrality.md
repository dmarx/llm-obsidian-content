economic centrality


**ASSISTANT**

**Economic centrality** is a concept derived from network theory, often applied in the study of economic systems to analyze the influence or importance of various actors (such as firms, industries, or countries) within an economic network. In economic networks, nodes represent these actors, and edges (or links) represent economic relationships, such as trade, investment, or supply chain connections.

To quantify economic centrality, one can use several centrality measures, each capturing different aspects of "importance" in a network. These metrics are built upon classic graph-theoretic centrality measures, but tailored to represent economic phenomena. Here’s a breakdown of commonly used centrality measures in economic contexts:

### 1. **Degree Centrality**
   - **Definition**: Degree centrality is simply the count of edges connected to a node. In an economic context, it might measure the number of direct trading partners a country has, or the number of firms a company does business with.
   - **Formula**: For a node \( v \) in a graph \( G = (V, E) \), the degree centrality \( C_D(v) \) is:
     $$ C_D(v) = \deg(v) = \sum_{u \in V} A_{vu} $$
     where \( A \) is the adjacency matrix of the network and \( A_{vu} \) indicates whether there is a direct link between nodes \( v \) and \( u \).

### 2. **Betweenness Centrality**
   - **Definition**: Betweenness centrality measures the extent to which a node acts as a bridge along the shortest path between other nodes. This is important in economics for capturing actors that control key intermediating functions, such as a country that controls a major trade route or a firm that connects multiple suppliers and buyers.
   - **Formula**: Betweenness centrality \( C_B(v) \) for a node \( v \) is given by:
     $$ C_B(v) = \sum_{s \neq v \neq t} \frac{\sigma_{st}(v)}{\sigma_{st}} $$
     where \( \sigma_{st} \) is the total number of shortest paths from node \( s \) to node \( t \), and \( \sigma_{st}(v) \) is the number of those paths that pass through \( v \).

### 3. **Closeness Centrality**
   - **Definition**: Closeness centrality measures how quickly a node can access other nodes in the network, typically reflecting how economically "reachable" an actor is. For example, a firm with high closeness centrality could rapidly access diverse markets or suppliers.
   - **Formula**: The closeness centrality \( C_C(v) \) is the inverse of the average shortest path length between node \( v \) and all other nodes:
     $$ C_C(v) = \frac{1}{\sum_{u \in V} d(v,u)} $$
     where \( d(v,u) \) is the shortest path distance between nodes \( v \) and \( u \).

### 4. **Eigenvector Centrality**
   - **Definition**: Eigenvector centrality accounts not only for how many connections a node has, but also for the quality (or importance) of those connections. In economic networks, this captures the idea that a firm or country is more central if it is connected to other influential nodes. This measure generalizes degree centrality by weighting connections according to their importance.
   - **Formula**: The eigenvector centrality \( C_E(v) \) of a node \( v \) is proportional to the sum of the eigenvector centralities of its neighbors:
     $$ C_E(v) = \frac{1}{\lambda} \sum_{u \in V} A_{vu} C_E(u) $$
     where \( \lambda \) is the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix \( A \), and \( A_{vu} \) indicates the presence of an edge between nodes \( v \) and \( u \).

### 5. **PageRank (or Katz Centrality)**
   - **Definition**: This is a variant of eigenvector centrality but incorporates a "damping" factor, which reduces the influence of distant nodes. In economic networks, it may model how influence spreads through the system, accounting for both direct and indirect connections with a decay factor.
   - **Formula**: The PageRank \( P(v) \) of a node \( v \) is computed iteratively by:
     $$ P(v) = \alpha \sum_{u \in \text{in-neighbors}(v)} \frac{P(u)}{\deg(u)} + (1 - \alpha)\frac{1}{N} $$
     where \( \alpha \) is the damping factor, typically set to 0.85, \( N \) is the total number of nodes, and \( \deg(u) \) is the out-degree of node \( u \).

### Applications in Economic Networks

Economic centrality measures are critical in understanding various phenomena, such as:
1. **Trade Networks**: In international trade, countries with high centrality are often crucial hubs in global trade. Degree centrality might show countries with the most trading partners, while betweenness centrality could highlight countries that facilitate key trade routes or agreements.
   
2. **Supply Chains**: Firms with high betweenness centrality are key intermediaries in supply chains, meaning disruptions in their operations could cause widespread ripple effects. Closeness centrality might indicate firms that can quickly adapt to supply or demand changes.
   
3. **Financial Networks**: In interbank lending or stock market networks, eigenvector centrality can identify institutions with systemic importance — those whose collapse could impact the broader financial system.

### Formalization in Economic Models

In formal economic models, such as input-output models or general equilibrium models, network structures can be embedded to represent the interdependencies between agents. These models incorporate centrality concepts to capture the structural importance of firms, industries, or countries. 

For instance, in an input-output model, an industry with high eigenvector centrality might be crucial to production because it supplies to industries that are themselves highly interconnected. Similarly, a country's trade centrality might be used in gravity models of trade to predict trade flows based on network position.

The study of **economic centrality** links well with both network theory and econometrics, serving as a tool for predicting the resilience of economies to shocks and the flow of capital or goods in interconnected systems.

Terms like [[input-output analysis]], [[network theory]], and [[economic complexity]] all leverage centrality concepts to explore structural patterns and effects.
