Chomsky hierarchy


**ASSISTANT**

The **Chomsky hierarchy** is a classification of formal languages based on their generative power, introduced by the linguist Noam Chomsky. This hierarchy categorizes languages and their corresponding grammars into four levels, each with increasing generative power and complexity. These levels are:

1. **Type 0: Recursively Enumerable Languages**
2. **Type 1: Context-Sensitive Languages**
3. **Type 2: Context-Free Languages**
4. **Type 3: Regular Languages**

### Type 0: Recursively Enumerable Languages

- **Grammar Type**: Unrestricted Grammar
- **Formal Definition**: $G = (V, \Sigma, R, S)$ where production rules are of the form $\alpha \rightarrow \beta$ with $\alpha, \beta \in (V \cup \Sigma)^+$ and $\alpha$ containing at least one non-terminal.
- **Automaton**: Turing Machine
- **Characteristics**: These languages can be recognized by a Turing machine. There are no restrictions on the production rules.

### Type 1: Context-Sensitive Languages

- **Grammar Type**: Context-Sensitive Grammar (CSG)
- **Formal Definition**: $G = (V, \Sigma, R, S)$ where production rules are of the form $\alpha A \beta \rightarrow \alpha \gamma \beta$ with $A \in V$, $\alpha, \beta \in (V \cup \Sigma)^*$, and $\gamma \in (V \cup \Sigma)^+$, and $|\gamma| \geq 1$.
- **Automaton**: Linear Bounded Automaton (LBA)
- **Characteristics**: The production rules ensure that the length of the string does not decrease during derivations. These languages can be recognized by a linear bounded automaton.

### Type 2: Context-Free Languages

- **Grammar Type**: Context-Free Grammar (CFG)
- **Formal Definition**: $G = (V, \Sigma, R, S)$ where production rules are of the form $A \rightarrow \alpha$ with $A \in V$ and $\alpha \in (V \cup \Sigma)^*$.
- **Automaton**: Pushdown Automaton (PDA)
- **Characteristics**: These languages are generated by context-free grammars and can be recognized by a pushdown automaton. They are widely used in programming languages and syntactic analysis.

### Type 3: Regular Languages

- **Grammar Type**: Regular Grammar
- **Formal Definition**: $G = (V, \Sigma, R, S)$ where production rules are of the form $A \rightarrow aB$ or $A \rightarrow a$ with $A, B \in V$ and $a \in \Sigma$.
- **Automaton**: Finite Automaton (FA)
- **Characteristics**: These languages can be generated by regular grammars and recognized by finite automata. They are the simplest class of languages and are used in text processing, lexical analysis, and simple pattern matching.

### Inclusion Relationships

The Chomsky hierarchy defines a strict inclusion relationship among the classes:

$$
\text{Regular} \subset \text{Context-Free} \subset \text{Context-Sensitive} \subset \text{Recursively Enumerable}
$$

This means that every [[regular language]] is also a context-free language, every context-free language is also a context-sensitive language, and every context-sensitive language is also a recursively enumerable language. However, the converse is not true.

### Examples

1. **Regular Languages**:
   - Strings of balanced parentheses: $\{a^n b^n \mid n \geq 0\}$
   - Binary strings with an even number of 0s: $\{w \in \{0,1\}^* \mid \text{number of 0s in } w \text{ is even}\}$

2. **Context-Free Languages**:
   - Palindromes: $\{w \in \{a, b\}^* \mid w = w^R\}$
   - Arithmetic expressions with balanced parentheses: $\{(a + b)^n \mid n \geq 0\}$

3. **Context-Sensitive Languages**:
   - $\{a^n b^n c^n \mid n \geq 0\}$ (strings with equal numbers of a's, b's, and c's)
   - $\{a^p \mid p \text{ is a prime number}\}$

4. **Recursively Enumerable Languages**:
   - Any language recognized by a Turing machine that may not halt on some inputs, such as the language of pairs $\{(M, w) \mid M \text{ is a Turing machine and } M \text{ accepts } w\}$.
