TEMPEST protocols


**ASSISTANT**

TEMPEST protocols are security measures designed to prevent unintended electronic emissions, also known as compromising emanations, from leaking classified information to unauthorized parties. These protocols are integral to secure environments like [[Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility|SCIF]]s, where they protect sensitive data from being intercepted by external surveillance. 

The term "TEMPEST" originated as a codename within the U.S. military and now represents a set of government standards that guide electromagnetic emissions security in secure facilities. The TEMPEST standards are highly classified, but publicly available information and government guidance provide insight into the protocols involved.

### Core Elements of TEMPEST Protocols

#### 1. **Control of Electromagnetic Emissions**
   TEMPEST focuses on controlling the leakage of electromagnetic signals (EM) from electronic devices. This includes:
   - **Emission Reduction**: TEMPEST protocols mandate reducing EM emissions at the source by designing equipment with shielding, grounding, and filtering to minimize electronic noise. For instance, TEMPEST-certified monitors, computers, and network devices are engineered to emit minimal RF or magnetic interference.
   - **Shielding**: This involves enclosing devices or entire rooms in conductive materials, often referred to as Faraday cages, which block RF signals from leaving the secure environment.
   - **Grounding and Bonding**: Equipment and components are grounded to create a common return path for electric currents, reducing the potential for EM leakage through unintended pathways.

#### 2. **Site and Facility Design Standards**
   Secure facility design is a critical component of TEMPEST protocols:
   - **SCIF Construction Standards**: SCIFs, which often require TEMPEST compliance, are constructed with shielded walls, floors, and ceilings to prevent EM emissions. This physical isolation blocks signal penetration through walls, windows, doors, or other potential leak points.
   - **Separation Distances (Control Zones)**: TEMPEST protocols require a minimum separation distance between secure areas and non-secure areas to minimize the risk of interception. This area, called a "control zone," defines the perimeter within which signals are shielded or attenuated to prevent interception.
   - **Cable Management and Routing**: TEMPEST standards dictate the routing of power and data cables to prevent "cross-talk," or unintended signal coupling. Cables carrying classified information are separated from others, and special shielded cables may be used to prevent emissions.

#### 3. **Electronic Device Control and Auditing**
   Electronic devices are tightly controlled and audited to comply with TEMPEST standards:
   - **Device Classification and Certification**: Only devices that meet TEMPEST certification standards are permitted within secure facilities. Non-certified devices, like unshielded laptops or cell phones, are prohibited in secure areas to prevent unintended EM leakage.
   - **Inspection and Testing**: TEMPEST-certified equipment undergoes regular inspections and emissions testing to ensure ongoing compliance, as wear or modifications could introduce new vulnerabilities.
   - **Removable Media Control**: Removable media and storage devices, such as USB drives, are restricted due to the risk of compromising emissions when interfaced with secure equipment.

#### 4. **Transmission Security (TRANSEC) Protocols**
   [[Transmission Security (TRANSEC)]] is a complementary concept that protects the integrity and confidentiality of data being transmitted. While TEMPEST focuses on physical EM emissions, TRANSEC secures intentional signal transmissions:
   - **Frequency-Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS)**: Used to mask the transmission frequency, this technique changes the transmission frequency over time to make interception harder.
   - **Encryption and Signal Modulation**: TRANSEC protocols require that all transmissions be encrypted and possibly modulated to prevent interception and decryption by unauthorized parties. This applies to any RF communication in or out of a secure facility.

#### 5. **Testing, Compliance, and Audits**
   Regular TEMPEST compliance checks ensure that facilities remain secure:
   - **Periodic Testing**: Facilities must undergo emissions testing and "TEMPEST sweeps" to identify and mitigate any EM leakage or other vulnerabilities. Tests simulate potential interception scenarios to evaluate the facility's security.
   - **Certification and Accreditation**: TEMPEST standards are governed by accrediting authorities such as the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), which provides guidance on the implementation and testing of TEMPEST measures.
   - **Continuous Monitoring**: For highly secure environments, continuous monitoring may be required to detect new electronic signals or anomalous emissions.

### Theoretical and Mathematical Considerations

From a technical standpoint, TEMPEST protocols involve concepts from electromagnetic theory and information security. Key mathematical tools include:

- **Maxwell's Equations**: Used to model EM fields and how they propagate from devices, providing insight into shielding requirements.
- **Signal Attenuation Models**: Quantifies the reduction of signal power with distance and through various materials, essential for setting control zone distances.
- **Fourier Transform Analysis**: Helps in understanding the frequency components of emitted signals, allowing identification of signals that may carry sensitive data.
- **Probability and Cryptographic Measures**: These models assess the likelihood of signal interception and aid in the design of encryption and frequency-hopping protocols to thwart interception.

### Governing Standards for TEMPEST Protocols

The TEMPEST standards are classified, but declassified elements provide some guidance on compliance. Relevant frameworks include:

- **National Security Agency (NSA) TEMPEST Specifications**: The NSA defines U.S. TEMPEST guidelines, often referenced as NSTISSAM (National Security Telecommunications and Information Systems Security Advisory Memoranda) TEMPEST standards.
- **NATO Standards**: NATO operates under standards known as "AMSG" (Allied Military Security Guidance) protocols, particularly AMSG 720B, which governs TEMPEST requirements for NATO member states.
- **Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS)**: Some FIPS publications, like FIPS 199 and FIPS 140-2, set encryption and security controls relevant to both TEMPEST and TRANSEC in secure environments.

TEMPEST protocols exemplify layered security, where physical, technical, and procedural controls combine to mitigate the risk of unintended information leaks through EM emissions. These measures are fundamental for protecting classified information against interception by adversarial entities and maintaining secure communication within and from classified environments.
