### Material Requirements Planning (MRP)

Material Requirements Planning (MRP) is a [[production planning]] and inventory control system used to manage manufacturing processes. MRP ensures that materials are available for production and products are available for delivery to customers. It helps maintain the lowest possible material and product levels in inventory, plan manufacturing activities, delivery schedules, and purchasing activities.

#### Key Concepts

1. **Bill of Materials (BOM)**: A comprehensive list of raw materials, components, and assemblies required to produce a finished product.
2. **Master Production Schedule (MPS)**: A detailed plan that states how many of each product will be produced and when.
3. **Inventory Records**: Detailed information about the quantities of materials and products in stock, on order, and allocated to production.
4. **Lead Time**: The time required to procure or produce an item.
5. **Lot Sizing**: Determining the quantity of items to order or produce at one time.
6. **Safety Stock**: Extra inventory kept to mitigate the risk of stockouts due to uncertainties in demand and supply.

#### Steps in MRP

1. **Demand Forecasting and MPS**:
   - Forecast future demand for finished products.
   - Develop the Master Production Schedule (MPS) based on the forecast and customer orders.

2. **BOM Explosion**:
   - Break down the finished product requirements into raw materials and components using the Bill of Materials (BOM).
   - Determine the quantities of each material required to meet the production schedule.

3. **Inventory Status Checking**:
   - Check current inventory levels, including on-hand stock, scheduled receipts, and allocated inventory.
   - Calculate the net requirements by subtracting the available inventory from the gross requirements.

4. **Lead Time Offsetting**:
   - Adjust the schedule to account for the lead times of each material and component.
   - Ensure that materials are ordered or produced in time to meet the production schedule.

5. **Order Release**:
   - Generate purchase orders for raw materials and production orders for components and subassemblies.
   - Schedule orders to ensure timely arrival and availability of materials.

6. **Monitor and Update**:
   - Continuously monitor inventory levels, production progress, and order status.
   - Update the MRP system to reflect changes in demand, production delays, and inventory discrepancies.

#### Example Problem

Suppose a company manufactures bicycles. Each bicycle requires:
- 1 frame
- 2 wheels
- 1 handlebar

Current inventory levels are:
- Frames: 50 units
- Wheels: 100 units
- Handlebars: 40 units

The company plans to produce 100 bicycles next month, and it takes 2 weeks to receive frames, 1 week to receive wheels, and 1 week to receive handlebars.

**Step-by-Step Solution**:

1. **Demand Forecasting and MPS**:
   - The company plans to produce 100 bicycles next month.

2. **BOM Explosion**:
   - For 100 bicycles, the required materials are:
     - Frames: 100 units
     - Wheels: 200 units
     - Handlebars: 100 units

3. **Inventory Status Checking**:
   - Current inventory:
     - Frames: 50 units
     - Wheels: 100 units
     - Handlebars: 40 units
   - Net requirements:
     - Frames: \( 100 - 50 = 50 \) units
     - Wheels: \( 200 - 100 = 100 \) units
     - Handlebars: \( 100 - 40 = 60 \) units

4. **Lead Time Offsetting**:
   - Considering lead times, the orders should be placed:
     - Frames: 2 weeks before production start
     - Wheels: 1 week before production start
     - Handlebars: 1 week before production start

5. **Order Release**:
   - Generate purchase orders:
     - Frames: 50 units, order 2 weeks in advance
     - Wheels: 100 units, order 1 week in advance
     - Handlebars: 60 units, order 1 week in advance

6. **Monitor and Update**:
   - Continuously monitor inventory and adjust orders as needed based on actual production and inventory changes.

#### Applications of MRP

1. **Manufacturing**: Ensuring timely availability of materials to meet production schedules.
2. **Retail**: Managing inventory levels of products to meet customer demand.
3. **Healthcare**: Managing medical supplies and equipment to ensure availability for patient care.
4. **Construction**: Coordinating the delivery of materials and components to construction sites.

#### Challenges in MRP

1. **Data Accuracy**: Accurate data on inventory levels, BOM, and lead times are crucial for effective MRP.
2. **Demand Variability**: Fluctuations in demand can complicate planning and require frequent adjustments.
3. **Lead Time Variability**: Changes in supplier lead times can disrupt production schedules.
4. **Complexity**: Managing a large number of components and products can be complex and requires robust systems.
5. **Integration**: Integrating MRP with other systems like ERP and [[supply chain management]] is essential for comprehensive planning.

#### Conclusion

Material Requirements Planning (MRP) is a vital tool for managing manufacturing processes, ensuring that materials are available when needed, and optimizing inventory levels. By leveraging accurate demand forecasts, detailed BOMs, and precise inventory records, businesses can efficiently plan production, reduce costs, and meet customer demand. Despite its challenges, MRP remains a cornerstone of effective production and [[inventory management]].
