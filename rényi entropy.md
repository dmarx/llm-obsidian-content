# Rényi Entropy

[[Rényi entropy]] is a generalization of [[Shannon entropy]] that introduces a parametric family of entropies. It was introduced by [[Alfréd Rényi]] in 1961 as a mathematical measure of information that extends traditional information-theoretic concepts.

## Mathematical Definition

For a discrete random variable $X$ with probability mass function $p(x)$, the Rényi entropy of order $\alpha$ (where $\alpha \geq 0, \alpha \neq 1$) is defined as:

$$H_\alpha(X) = \frac{1}{1-\alpha} \log_2 \left( \sum_{x \in \mathcal{X}} p(x)^\alpha \right)$$

where $\mathcal{X}$ is the support of $X$.

For a continuous random variable with probability density function $f(x)$, the Rényi entropy is:

$$H_\alpha(X) = \frac{1}{1-\alpha} \log_2 \left( \int_{\mathcal{X}} f(x)^\alpha \, dx \right)$$

## Special Cases

The parameter $\alpha$ controls the sensitivity of the entropy to the shape of the probability distribution:

1. **Min-entropy** ($\alpha = \infty$): 
   $$H_\infty(X) = -\log_2(\max_x p(x))$$
   
   This represents the worst-case predictability of a random variable.

2. **Collision entropy** ($\alpha = 2$):
   $$H_2(X) = -\log_2 \sum_{x \in \mathcal{X}} p(x)^2$$
   
   This is related to the probability of two independent samples colliding.

3. **Shannon entropy** ($\alpha \rightarrow 1$):
   $$H_1(X) = -\sum_{x \in \mathcal{X}} p(x) \log_2 p(x)$$
   
   The limit of Rényi entropy as $\alpha$ approaches 1 is the [[Shannon entropy]].

4. **Hartley entropy** ($\alpha = 0$):
   $$H_0(X) = \log_2 |\mathcal{X}|$$
   
   This measures the size of the support of $X$.

## Properties

1. **Monotonicity**: For fixed $X$, $H_\alpha(X)$ is a non-increasing function of $\alpha$.

2. **Concavity**: Rényi entropy is a concave function of the distribution for $0 \leq \alpha \leq 1$.

3. **Additivity**: For independent random variables $X$ and $Y$:
   $$H_\alpha(X,Y) = H_\alpha(X) + H_\alpha(Y)$$

4. **Continuity**: $H_\alpha(X)$ is continuous in $\alpha$ for $\alpha > 0$.

## Applications

### Information Theory
- Quantifies the uncertainty or randomness in a system beyond the standard [[Shannon entropy]]
- Provides a flexible framework for analyzing systems with different sensitivities to rare events

### Machine Learning
- Used in [[Maximum entropy classification]]
- Applied in [[Transfer learning]] frameworks
- Employed in [[Clustering algorithms]] for measuring dissimilarity

### Quantum Information Theory
- Generalized to [[Quantum Rényi entropy]]
- Used in the study of [[Entanglement measures]]

### Cryptography
- Applied in security proofs requiring different entropy measures
- Used in [[Randomness extraction]]

### Statistical Physics
- Connected to [[Thermodynamic free energy]]
- Used in the analysis of [[Multifractal systems]]

## Connection to Other Entropy Measures

Rényi entropy is part of a broader family of generalized entropies that includes:

- [[Tsallis entropy]]: $S_q(X) = \frac{1}{q-1}\left(1-\sum_x p(x)^q\right)$
- [[Sharma-Mittal entropy]]: Combines aspects of both Rényi and Tsallis entropies
- [[Escort entropy]]: Based on escort distributions derived from the original distribution

## Mathematical Representations

The Rényi entropy can be expressed in terms of the [[Rényi divergence]] between a distribution and the uniform distribution:

$$H_\alpha(X) = \log_2 |\mathcal{X}| - D_\alpha(p || u)$$

where $D_\alpha(p || u)$ is the Rényi divergence and $u$ is the uniform distribution over $\mathcal{X}$.

## Estimation from Samples

Practical estimation of Rényi entropy from finite samples can be challenging. Common approaches include:

- [[k-nearest neighbor statistics]]
- [[Kernel density estimation]]
- [[Histogram-based methods]]

These methods have different bias-variance tradeoffs depending on the order $\alpha$ and sample size.
