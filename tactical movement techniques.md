tactical movement techniques


**ASSISTANT**

**Tactical movement techniques** are critical for military units to move safely and efficiently through potentially hostile environments. These techniques are designed to minimize exposure to enemy fire, allow for quick responses to threats, and maintain control over the unit’s positioning and actions. Tactical movement is essential in both urban and rural settings, where terrain, enemy presence, and operational objectives require careful planning and execution.

### Common Tactical Movement Techniques

There are several key tactical movement techniques used by military forces, each with specific advantages and disadvantages depending on the situation. These techniques are primarily based on **terrain** and **enemy presence** and can be adapted for use by foot patrols or vehicles.

### 1. **Traveling**
**Traveling** is the fastest tactical movement technique and is used when enemy contact is **not expected** but speed is essential to reach an objective. It involves moving in a relatively relaxed formation without designated overwatch elements. 

- **Formation**: Units typically move in a **column formation**, where one element follows another, maintaining loose spacing.
- **Speed**: Maximum speed is prioritized, allowing the unit to cover ground quickly.
- **Vulnerability**: Traveling exposes the unit to potential ambushes or attacks, as there is minimal overwatch or protection from concealed threats.
  
#### Best Use:
- **Low threat environments**: When enemy contact is not likely, and the goal is to cover ground quickly, such as during long-distance movements or routine patrols.
  
#### Advantages:
- **Speed**: It allows units to move rapidly, saving time and maintaining operational tempo.
  
#### Disadvantages:
- **Lack of security**: Without overwatch or proper spacing, the unit is vulnerable to surprise attacks or ambushes.

### 2. **Traveling Overwatch**
**Traveling overwatch** provides a balance between speed and security. This technique is used when enemy contact is **possible but not imminent**. One element moves forward, while another maintains overwatch from a slight distance, ready to provide covering fire if needed.

- **Formation**: Units move in a **staggered column** or **wedge formation**, with some elements maintaining a greater distance to provide overwatch.
- **Speed**: Faster than bounding overwatch, but slower than traveling.
- **Security**: Provides additional protection compared to traveling, as overwatch elements are positioned to detect and engage threats if they arise.

#### Best Use:
- **Moderate threat environments**: When there is a possibility of enemy contact, but the main priority is still speed. Often used in relatively open terrain with limited cover, such as plains or deserts.
  
#### Advantages:
- **Increased security**: Overwatch elements are in position to detect and react to enemy threats while the main body advances.
  
#### Disadvantages:
- **Moderate speed**: While faster than bounding overwatch, it is still slower than regular traveling.

### 3. **Bounding Overwatch**
**Bounding overwatch** is the most cautious and deliberate tactical movement technique, used when enemy contact is **expected** or **imminent**. It involves one element moving forward (bounding) while the other provides cover (overwatch). This technique ensures that at least one part of the unit is ready to engage the enemy at all times.

- **Formation**: The unit is divided into two or more teams. One team remains stationary and provides overwatch while the other bounds forward, using either **successive** or **alternating bounds**.
- **Speed**: Bounding overwatch is slow but very secure, ensuring that the moving element is always covered by overwatch.
- **Security**: Maximum security, as the overwatch team is positioned to immediately suppress enemy fire if contact is made.

#### Best Use:
- **High threat environments**: When enemy contact is highly likely, such as during an approach to an enemy position, crossing danger areas, or moving through **ambush-prone terrain** (e.g., narrow valleys, urban areas).
  
#### Advantages:
- **High security**: Provides the greatest level of protection against enemy fire and ambushes, as one team is always covering the other.
  
#### Disadvantages:
- **Very slow**: This technique significantly reduces speed, making it impractical for long-distance movements where speed is essential.

### 4. **Wedge Formation**
The **wedge formation** is a flexible and commonly used formation for both **movement** and **combat operations**. It allows for good firepower in multiple directions and facilitates easy transitions between movement techniques.

- **Formation**: The unit is arranged in a **V-shape** or wedge, with the point of the wedge leading the formation. Each squad member has a designated sector of fire, covering different directions.
- **Speed**: Moderate speed, with the ability to engage the enemy from multiple directions.
- **Security**: Provides good all-around security, with each soldier covering a specific sector (left, right, or front).

#### Best Use:
- **Open terrain**: Where maintaining flexibility in firepower and maintaining situational awareness in all directions is important. Wedge formations are commonly used during patrols in open fields or deserts.
  
#### Advantages:
- **Good firepower coverage**: Allows for quick engagement of enemy forces from any direction.
- **Flexibility**: Easy to adjust into other formations or movement techniques (such as bounding overwatch).

#### Disadvantages:
- **Requires spacing discipline**: In tight terrain (e.g., dense forests or urban environments), maintaining proper spacing and orientation can be difficult.

### 5. **File Formation**
The **file formation** is a simple column where soldiers or vehicles move in a straight line, one behind the other. It is commonly used in **tight or restricted terrain** where other formations are not practical, such as dense forests, mountains, or urban alleyways.

- **Formation**: Soldiers or vehicles are arranged in a straight line, following each other.
- **Speed**: Faster than wedge or echelon formations due to the simplicity of the arrangement.
- **Security**: Limited security, especially against flanking attacks, as all soldiers are facing the same direction with limited lateral coverage.

#### Best Use:
- **Dense or restricted terrain**: Used in environments where space is limited, such as narrow trails, dense forests, or urban alleys.
  
#### Advantages:
- **Simplicity**: Easy to form and maintain, especially in environments where visibility and maneuverability are limited.
- **Speed**: Relatively fast compared to more complex formations.

#### Disadvantages:
- **Vulnerable to flanking**: File formations have poor coverage to the sides, making them vulnerable to ambushes from the flanks.
- **Limited firepower**: Soldiers can primarily engage targets to the front, with limited ability to fire to the sides or rear.

### 6. **Echelon Formation**
The **echelon formation** is used to provide firepower in a specific direction, either left or right. This formation is often used when the unit expects contact from one side and wants to orient its firepower accordingly.

- **Formation**: Soldiers or vehicles are arranged in a diagonal line, either left or right, creating a slanted formation. Each element follows the one in front, with the formation angled toward the expected enemy position.
- **Speed**: Slower than wedge or file formations due to the deliberate spacing and orientation required.
- **Security**: Provides strong firepower to one side (the direction of the echelon), but leaves the opposite side more vulnerable.

#### Best Use:
- **Anticipated contact from one direction**: The echelon formation is useful when the unit expects to engage the enemy from a specific direction, such as when advancing along a ridge or through a valley where the enemy is expected on one flank.
  
#### Advantages:
- **Maximizes firepower**: Concentrates firepower on one side, allowing for rapid and overwhelming engagement in that direction.
  
#### Disadvantages:
- **Vulnerability**: The side opposite the direction of the echelon is vulnerable to attack, as fewer soldiers or vehicles are oriented toward that direction.
- **Slower movement**: Requires precise coordination and spacing, slowing the unit’s overall movement.

### 7. **Danger Area Crossing**
Crossing **danger areas**—such as open fields, roads, or rivers—requires careful planning to minimize exposure to enemy fire. There are two common methods for crossing danger areas:

- **Bounding Overwatch Across Danger Areas**: The unit uses **bounding overwatch** to cross danger areas while maintaining security. One team moves across the danger area while the other provides overwatch, and then the roles are reversed.
- **Rushing Across Danger Areas**: In situations where speed is essential, the unit may opt to quickly rush across the danger area without stopping for overwatch. This method minimizes time in the exposed area but increases vulnerability.

#### Best Use:
- **Open terrain or exposed areas**: When moving across roads, rivers, open fields, or other areas where the unit lacks cover and concealment.
  
#### Advantages:
- **Minimizes exposure**: Properly executed bounding overwatch ensures the unit remains covered while crossing dangerous terrain.
  
#### Disadvantages:
- **Slower progress**: Bounding overwatch slows down movement, and rushing across danger areas increases the risk of exposure to enemy fire.

### Conclusion

**Tactical movement techniques** are essential for the survival and effectiveness of military units operating in hostile environments. Whether moving through open terrain, urban environments, or dense forests, units must select the appropriate movement technique based on terrain, the likelihood of enemy contact, and mission objectives. Techniques like **traveling**, **traveling overwatch**, and **bounding overwatch** are foundational skills that ensure units can move while maintaining the necessary balance of speed and security. Proper use of **formations**—such as wedge, file, and echelon—further enhances a unit
