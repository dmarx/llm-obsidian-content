**ASSISTANT**

**Homemade Explosives (HMEs)** are explosive materials crafted from readily available, everyday chemicals. These materials are often used by insurgents or bomb-makers in place of conventional military-grade explosives due to their accessibility and ease of production. However, HMEs are often less stable and more sensitive to external conditions, such as heat, friction, and impact, making them highly dangerous to both the bomb-maker and anyone attempting to handle or disarm them. 

EOD technicians are frequently confronted with these types of explosives, especially in asymmetric warfare and terrorist scenarios. Understanding the composition, properties, and risks associated with HMEs is crucial for both disarmament and public safety.

### Common Types of HMEs

1. **Ammonium Nitrate Fuel Oil (ANFO)**
   **Ammonium nitrate mixed with fuel oil** is one of the most widely used homemade explosives due to the easy availability of ammonium nitrate (commonly used as a fertilizer) and fuel oil (used in agriculture, construction, or transportation).
   
   - **Composition**: Typically, ANFO consists of about 94% ammonium nitrate and 6% fuel oil. The ammonium nitrate acts as an oxidizer, while the fuel oil provides the combustible fuel. The mixture itself is relatively stable but requires a **high-energy initiator**, such as a detonator or booster charge, to trigger detonation.
   
   - **Detonation properties**: ANFO is a low-cost explosive that produces a large volume of gas upon detonation, making it highly effective for demolitions, particularly in mining or large-scale attacks, such as vehicle-borne IEDs (VBIEDs). It has a relatively high **brisance** (shattering capability) compared to other HMEs, but its energy output is not as high as more sophisticated explosives like TNT.
   
   - **Risks**: ANFO is relatively stable during handling and transport, which makes it less dangerous to the bomb-maker than other HMEs. However, improper storage, contamination, or the use of a powerful enough detonator can still cause unintended explosions.

   **Chemical reaction**:  
   $$ NH_4NO_3 \rightarrow N_2 + O_2 + H_2O + CO_2 + \text{heat} $$
   This exothermic reaction results in the rapid expansion of gases that drive the explosion.

2. **Urea Nitrate**
   **Urea nitrate** is another common HME made from urea (a widely available agricultural fertilizer) and nitric acid. It acts as both a **fuel** and an **oxidizer**, which makes it more efficient in terms of energy release compared to ANFO.

   - **Composition**: Urea nitrate is formed by reacting **urea** with **nitric acid**, producing a white crystalline solid. The resulting compound is highly sensitive to **friction**, **shock**, and **heat**.
   
   - **Detonation properties**: Urea nitrate has a higher energy output than ANFO and is often used in smaller, more portable explosive devices. It is less stable than ANFO and requires careful handling. Urea nitrate is relatively easy to synthesize with basic chemical knowledge and access to the necessary ingredients.
   
   - **Risks**: Urea nitrate is highly sensitive to accidental detonation, especially from friction or shock. This makes it very dangerous to handle, and it can easily explode during transport or assembly. 

   **Chemical formula**:  
   $$ CO(NH_2)_2 + HNO_3 \rightarrow CO(NH_2)NO_3 $$

3. **Hydrogen Peroxide-Based Explosives**
   **Hydrogen peroxide** is a powerful oxidizer that can be used to make very sensitive explosives such as **Triacetone Triperoxide (TATP)** and **Hexamethylene Triperoxide Diamine (HMTD)**. These explosives are highly unstable and can be set off by heat, friction, or impact, making them extremely dangerous to both the user and anyone tasked with neutralizing the device.

   - **TATP (Triacetone Triperoxide)**:  
     **TATP** is often referred to as the "Mother of Satan" due to its extreme sensitivity and instability. It is made from **acetone**, **hydrogen peroxide**, and an acid catalyst (usually sulfuric acid). TATP does not require a detonator to explode, as it can be triggered by very low levels of mechanical stress or heat.

     - **Composition**: The basic reaction for synthesizing TATP involves mixing acetone and hydrogen peroxide in the presence of an acid catalyst. The resulting compound is a highly crystalline white powder that is sensitive to friction, shock, and temperature changes.
     
     - **Detonation properties**: TATP is a powerful explosive, with a relatively high **velocity of detonation** (VOD) of around 5,300 meters per second. While it can be used in small quantities in IEDs or suicide vests, its unpredictability makes it dangerous to handle, store, or transport.
     
     - **Risks**: TATP is **extremely sensitive**. Even minor mechanical disturbances (e.g., shaking or grinding) can cause it to detonate. It is particularly dangerous because it does not require a traditional detonator, meaning it can explode during preparation or while being transported.

     **Reaction**:  
     $$ 3C_3H_6O + 3H_2O_2 \rightarrow C_9H_{18}O_6 + 3H_2O $$  
     This forms **TATP** (C₉H₁₈O₆), a highly sensitive peroxide-based explosive.

   - **HMTD (Hexamethylene Triperoxide Diamine)**:  
     **HMTD** is another highly sensitive peroxide-based explosive. Like TATP, it can be synthesized from easily available materials such as **hexamine** (found in fuel tablets), **hydrogen peroxide**, and an acid catalyst.
     
     - **Composition**: HMTD is a white crystalline powder formed from the reaction of hexamine, hydrogen peroxide, and citric acid. It is commonly used as a **primary explosive** due to its high sensitivity and ability to detonate with relatively low energy input.
     
     - **Detonation properties**: HMTD has a lower energy output compared to TATP but is still highly sensitive to heat, friction, and impact. It is often used as an initiator to set off larger secondary charges, such as ANFO or urea nitrate.
     
     - **Risks**: Like TATP, HMTD is extremely dangerous to produce and handle. It can detonate unexpectedly due to minor disturbances and is prone to degradation, which can make it even more unstable over time.

     **Reaction**:  
     $$ C_6H_{12}N_4 + 6H_2O_2 \rightarrow C_6H_{12}O_6N_4 + 6H_2O $$  
     This forms **HMTD** (C₆H₁₂O₆N₄), a primary explosive.

### General Risks Associated with HMEs
HMEs are inherently dangerous due to their instability and the variability in their chemical purity and composition. Specific risks include:
- **Sensitivity to Friction and Impact**: Many HMEs, especially peroxide-based explosives like TATP and HMTD, are highly sensitive to mechanical disturbance. Even a minor bump, shake, or drop can trigger detonation.
- **Thermal Sensitivity**: Many homemade explosives, particularly hydrogen peroxide-based compounds, are sensitive to temperature changes. Heat from sunlight or body warmth can cause spontaneous detonation.
- **Unpredictable Detonation**: Because of the inconsistent quality of materials and the lack of precise control over the chemical reactions during the manufacturing process, the behavior of HMEs is often unpredictable, making them hazardous for both the bomb-maker and those attempting to disarm the device.
  
For **EOD technicians**, handling HMEs requires extreme caution and specialized knowledge of each compound’s sensitivity and behavior under different environmental conditions. In many cases, HMEs are disarmed remotely to avoid the risks associated with close contact.

### Conclusion
**Homemade Explosives (HMEs)** like ANFO, urea nitrate, and hydrogen peroxide-based explosives (e.g., TATP, HMTD) present significant risks due to their accessibility and high sensitivity. Understanding the chemical composition, detonation properties, and associated dangers of each type of HME is essential for EOD technicians tasked with identifying, disarming, and safely disposing of these devices. The unpredictable nature of many HMEs, especially peroxide-based explosives, makes them a particularly dangerous threat in both insurgent and terrorist scenarios.
