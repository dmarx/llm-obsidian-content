**USER**

whats $\tilde{p}$? I think you may have introduced some notation without clearly explaining it.


**ASSISTANT**

The user is right - I introduced $\tilde{p}(x)$ in the score function section without clearly explaining what it represents. Looking back at what I wrote:

"If $p(x) = \frac{\tilde{p}(x)}{Z}$ where $Z = \int \tilde{p}(x) dx$, then..."

I used $\tilde{p}(x)$ to represent the unnormalized density (the numerator before normalizing by the partition function), but I didn't explicitly define this. This is a common notation in statistical mechanics and machine learning, but I should have been clearer about what it represents.

Let me clarify this notation and explain the concept more thoroughly.You're absolutely right - I introduced $\tilde{p}(x)$ without proper definition. Let me clarify this crucial notation:

## Unnormalized Density

$\tilde{p}(x)$ represents the [[unnormalized density]] (also called the [[unnormalized probability mass]]). Many probability models are naturally specified in terms of an unnormalized function that must be normalized to form a proper probability density.

**Formal Definition:**
Given an unnormalized density $\tilde{p}(x) \geq 0$, the corresponding probability density is:

$$p(x) = \frac{\tilde{p}(x)}{Z}$$

where the [[partition function]] (or [[normalization constant]]) is:

$$Z = \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} \tilde{p}(x) dx$$

**Examples of Unnormalized Densities:**

1. **Boltzmann Distribution**: $\tilde{p}(x) = \exp(-E(x)/kT)$ where $E(x)$ is energy
2. **Exponential Family**: $\tilde{p}(x) = \exp(\theta^T T(x))$ where $T(x)$ are sufficient statistics  
3. **Gaussian**: $\tilde{p}(x) = \exp(-\frac{1}{2}(x-\mu)^T\Sigma^{-1}(x-\mu))$

**The Key Insight:**
The score function only depends on the unnormalized density:

$$s(x) = \nabla_x \log p(x) = \nabla_x \log \frac{\tilde{p}(x)}{Z} = \nabla_x \log \tilde{p}(x) - \nabla_x \log Z = \nabla_x \log \tilde{p}(x)$$

Since $Z$ is a constant (independent of $x$), $\nabla_x \log Z = 0$.

This is why score matching can work with models where computing $Z$ is intractable - we only need access to $\tilde{p}(x)$, not the normalized density $p(x)$.
