Generalized entropy index


**ASSISTANT**

The generalized entropy index is a versatile measure of inequality or diversity that extends beyond the more commonly known measures such as the Gini coefficient or Shannon entropy. It is used primarily in economics and social sciences to assess the distribution of income, wealth, or other resources. By tuning its sensitivity parameter, the generalized entropy index can emphasize different parts of the distribution, providing a nuanced understanding of inequality or diversity.

### Definition

The generalized entropy index \( GE(\alpha) \) for a distribution of incomes \( \{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_N\} \) with mean income \(\mu\) is defined as:

$$
GE(\alpha) = \frac{1}{\alpha(\alpha - 1)} \left( \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \left( \frac{x_i}{\mu} \right)^\alpha - 1 \right),
$$

where \(\alpha\) is a parameter that determines the sensitivity of the index to different parts of the income distribution.

### Interpretation

The parameter \(\alpha\) controls the sensitivity of the generalized entropy index to different parts of the distribution:

- **\(\alpha = 0\)**: The measure is sensitive to the lower end of the distribution. This is equivalent to the mean logarithmic deviation (MLD):
  $$
  GE(0) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \log \left( \frac{\mu}{x_i} \right).
  $$

- **\(\alpha = 1\)**: The measure is equally sensitive to all parts of the distribution. This is equivalent to the Theil index:
  $$
  GE(1) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \left( \frac{x_i}{\mu} \right) \log \left( \frac{x_i}{\mu} \right).
  $$

- **\(\alpha = 2\)**: The measure is sensitive to the upper end of the distribution. This is equivalent to half the squared coefficient of variation:
  $$
  GE(2) = \frac{1}{2N} \sum_{i=1}^N \left( \frac{x_i}{\mu} - 1 \right)^2.
  $$

### Properties

1. **Non-negativity**: \( GE(\alpha) \geq 0 \), with \( GE(\alpha) = 0 \) if and only if all incomes are equal.
2. **Symmetry**: The index is symmetric with respect to income distribution.
3. **Decomposability**: The generalized entropy index can be decomposed into within-group and between-group inequality components, making it useful for analyzing the sources of inequality.
4. **Sensitivity**: By adjusting \(\alpha\), the index can be made more sensitive to inequality at different parts of the distribution (e.g., lower, middle, upper).

### Applications

#### Income and Wealth Inequality

The generalized entropy index is widely used to measure economic inequality. Different values of \(\alpha\) can reveal different aspects of the distribution of income or wealth:
- **Lower \(\alpha\) values**: Highlight disparities among lower-income individuals.
- **Higher \(\alpha\) values**: Emphasize differences among higher-income individuals.

#### Health Disparities

In public health, the generalized entropy index can be used to assess disparities in health outcomes or access to healthcare services. It helps to identify which segments of the population are most affected by inequality.

#### Educational Achievement

In education, the generalized entropy index can measure inequality in academic performance or educational attainment across different regions or demographic groups.

### Example: Calculating the Generalized Entropy Index

Consider a simple example with three individuals having incomes \(\{10, 20, 30\}\).

1. **Mean Income**:
   $$
   \mu = \frac{10 + 20 + 30}{3} = 20.
   $$

2. **Generalized Entropy Index for \(\alpha = 1\) (Theil Index)**:
   $$
   GE(1) = \frac{1}{3} \left( \left( \frac{10}{20} \right) \log \left( \frac{10}{20} \right) + \left( \frac{20}{20} \right) \log \left( \frac{20}{20} \right) + \left( \frac{30}{20} \right) \log \left( \frac{30}{20} \right) \right).
   $$
   Simplifying the terms inside the sum:
   $$
   GE(1) = \frac{1}{3} \left( 0.5 \log 0.5 + 1 \log 1 + 1.5 \log 1.5 \right).
   $$
   Using \(\log_2\) (for bits):
   $$
   GE(1) \approx \frac{1}{3} \left( 0.5 \times -1 + 0 + 1.5 \times 0.585 \right) \approx \frac{1}{3} \left( -0.5 + 0 + 0.8775 \right) \approx 0.1258.
   $$

### Conclusion

The generalized entropy index provides a flexible and powerful tool for measuring inequality or diversity within a distribution. By adjusting the sensitivity parameter \(\alpha\), it allows for a detailed analysis of different parts of the distribution, making it applicable in various fields such as economics, public health, and education.
