Distributed Reaction Regime


**ASSISTANT**

The **Distributed Reaction Regime** is a combustion regime that occurs in turbulent flows where the turbulent mixing and eddies significantly disrupt the traditional thin flame structure. In this regime, the turbulence intensity is high enough that the flame front is no longer a distinct, thin sheet but becomes broadened, and the chemical reactions are spread out over a larger volume. This regime is typically characterized by a low Damköhler number (\( Da \)) and a high Karlovitz number (\( Ka \)).

### 1. **Key Characteristics of the Distributed Reaction Regime**

The distributed reaction regime arises when the turbulent mixing scales are on the same order or smaller than the flame thickness. This leads to significant interactions between the turbulence and the flame, causing the flame to thicken and become more diffused.

#### **1.1 Turbulent Mixing and Flame Structure**
- **Thickened Flame**: Unlike in the [[flamelet regime]] where the flame is thin and well-defined, in the distributed reaction regime, the flame is thickened due to the intense mixing caused by small-scale turbulence.
- **Distributed Reaction Zones**: The reactions are not confined to a narrow flame front but occur over a distributed region within the flow, leading to a more homogeneous mixture of reactants and products.

#### **1.2 Damköhler Number (\(Da\))**
- **Low Damköhler Number**: The Damköhler number, defined as the ratio of the chemical reaction time to the turbulent mixing time, is low in this regime. This indicates that the mixing time is comparable to or faster than the reaction time, allowing turbulence to play a significant role in the combustion process.

#### **1.3 Karlovitz Number (\(Ka\))**
- **High Karlovitz Number**: The Karlovitz number, which compares the smallest turbulent eddy time scale to the chemical reaction time scale, is high. This means that the small turbulent eddies can penetrate the flame and affect the reaction zones directly, leading to enhanced mixing and broadened reaction zones.

#### **1.4 Flame-Turbulence Interaction**
- **Intense Interaction**: The turbulence and the flame interact strongly, leading to a scenario where the traditional laminar flame structure is disrupted, and the flame becomes highly wrinkled, fragmented, or even partially extinguished in regions of intense turbulence.

#### **1.5 Homogenization of Reaction Zones**
- **Quasi-Homogeneous Combustion**: The strong mixing by turbulence tends to homogenize the reactants and products, resulting in a more uniform temperature and species distribution across the combustion zone. This can lead to more uniform burning and less localized peak temperatures, potentially reducing the formation of pollutants like NOx.

### 2. **Modeling the Distributed Reaction Regime**

Modeling the distributed reaction regime is challenging due to the complex interactions between turbulence and chemistry. Several approaches have been developed to capture the key features of this regime:

#### **2.1 Large Eddy Simulation (LES)**
- **Resolved Turbulence**: LES is well-suited for simulating the distributed reaction regime because it can resolve the large-scale turbulent structures while modeling the smaller scales that interact with the flame.
- **Sub-Grid Scale (SGS) Models**: In LES, SGS models are used to represent the effects of unresolved turbulence on the combustion process. These models are particularly important in the distributed reaction regime where the interaction between turbulence and chemistry is complex.

#### **2.2 Probability Density Function (PDF) Methods**
- **Turbulence-Chemistry Interaction**: PDF methods model the statistical distribution of turbulent fluctuations in temperature, species concentration, and other flow variables. This approach is effective in capturing the broad range of conditions under which reactions occur in the distributed reaction regime.
- **Joint PDF**: In some cases, a joint PDF of the mixture fraction and temperature or other relevant variables is used to better represent the coupling between turbulence and chemical reactions.

#### **2.3 Thickened Flame Models**
- **Artificial Thickening**: In this approach, the flame is artificially thickened to a scale that can be resolved by the computational grid. The thickened flame model then uses modified transport coefficients to preserve the correct flame propagation speed and structure.
- **Effective Reaction Rate**: The reaction rate is adjusted to account for the thickening, ensuring that the model captures the broadening of the reaction zone due to turbulence.

#### **2.4 Eddy Dissipation Concept (EDC)**
- **Turbulent Micro-Mixing**: The EDC model is based on the concept that chemical reactions occur in small regions where the turbulent eddies dissipate. This model is particularly useful in the distributed reaction regime where reactions occur in the intensely mixed zones created by the smallest turbulent eddies.

### 3. **Challenges in the Distributed Reaction Regime**

Modeling and understanding the distributed reaction regime involves several challenges:

#### **3.1 Complex Turbulence-Chemistry Interaction**
- **Nonlinear Dynamics**: The interaction between turbulence and chemistry is highly nonlinear, leading to complex behaviors that are difficult to predict and model accurately.
- **Multiscale Nature**: The distributed reaction regime involves a wide range of scales, from the large eddies that transport reactants to the small eddies that mix them at the molecular level. Capturing these scales accurately requires high-resolution simulations or sophisticated models.

#### **3.2 Extinction and Reignition**
- **Localized Extinction**: In regions of very high turbulence, the flame can be locally extinguished due to excessive mixing and heat loss. Predicting where and when these extinctions occur is challenging.
- **Reignition**: Following extinction, the flame can reignite in certain conditions. Modeling this process requires capturing the intricate balance between heat release, turbulent mixing, and chemical kinetics.

#### **3.3 Numerical Resolution**
- **Grid Dependence**: The accuracy of simulations in the distributed reaction regime is highly dependent on the grid resolution. Insufficient resolution can lead to inaccurate predictions of the reaction zone structure and dynamics.
- **Computational Cost**: Achieving the necessary resolution to accurately simulate the distributed reaction regime is computationally expensive, particularly in three-dimensional, high Reynolds number flows.

### 4. **Applications of the Distributed Reaction Regime**

The distributed reaction regime is relevant in several practical applications, particularly where intense turbulence interacts with combustion:

#### **4.1 Internal Combustion Engines**
- **Lean-Burn Engines**: In lean-burn internal combustion engines, the fuel-air mixture is often highly turbulent, leading to distributed combustion. Understanding and modeling this regime is crucial for optimizing engine performance and reducing emissions.

#### **4.2 Gas Turbines**
- **High-Pressure Combustors**: In gas turbines, especially in the high-pressure combustors used in power generation and aviation, the distributed reaction regime can occur, affecting flame stability and emissions.
- **Lean Premixed Combustion**: Lean premixed combustion systems in gas turbines operate in a distributed reaction regime to achieve low emissions, making accurate modeling essential for design and operation.

#### **4.3 Industrial Burners**
- **High Turbulence Burners**: Industrial burners that operate under conditions of high turbulence often exhibit distributed combustion. Proper modeling of this regime is important for controlling flame shape, stability, and pollutant formation.

#### **4.4 Safety and Accidental Explosions**
- **Explosion Dynamics**: In safety studies, understanding the distributed reaction regime is important for predicting the behavior of explosions and deflagrations in highly turbulent environments, such as in accidental releases of flammable gases.

### 5. **Conclusion**

The distributed reaction regime represents a complex and challenging aspect of turbulent combustion where traditional flamelet-based models are no longer valid. In this regime, the flame is no longer a thin, well-defined surface but rather a thickened, distributed reaction zone influenced by intense turbulent mixing. Accurately capturing this regime requires advanced modeling techniques, such as LES, PDF methods, and thickened flame models, which can account for the intricate interplay between turbulence and chemical reactions. Understanding and simulating the distributed reaction regime is crucial for optimizing combustion systems in a wide range of engineering applications, from engines and turbines to industrial burners and safety studies.
