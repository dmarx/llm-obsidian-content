Shock Waves


**ASSISTANT**

### Shock Waves

**Shock waves** are a fundamental phenomenon in compressible fluid dynamics, characterized by an abrupt, nearly discontinuous change in the properties of a fluid, such as pressure, temperature, density, and velocity. They occur when a fluid is compressed so rapidly that the changes in the fluid properties propagate faster than the speed of sound, resulting in a steep front where these properties change drastically over a very short distance.

### Characteristics of Shock Waves

1. **Discontinuity**:
   - Shock waves represent a discontinuity in the flow field, where fluid properties like pressure, density, and temperature change almost instantaneously.

2. **Compression**:
   - Across a shock wave, the fluid is compressed. This means that the density and pressure increase, while the velocity decreases if the shock is moving in the same direction as the fluid flow.

3. **Irreversibility**:
   - The process across a shock wave is highly irreversible, resulting in an increase in entropy. This irreversibility leads to energy dissipation, typically in the form of heat.

4. **Speed**:
   - Shock waves travel at speeds greater than the local speed of sound in the medium. The speed of the shock wave depends on the conditions on either side of the shock.

### Types of Shock Waves

1. **Normal Shock Waves**:
   - A normal shock wave occurs when the shock front is perpendicular to the flow direction. This is common in situations where a supersonic flow is suddenly decelerated to subsonic speeds, such as in the throat of a converging-diverging nozzle operating at certain conditions.

   - **Properties Across a Normal Shock**:
     - **Velocity**: The velocity decreases from supersonic to subsonic.
     - **Pressure**: Pressure increases across the shock.
     - **Density**: Density increases.
     - **Temperature**: Temperature increases due to the conversion of kinetic energy into internal energy.
     - **Entropy**: Entropy increases, reflecting the irreversible nature of the process.

2. **Oblique Shock Waves**:
   - Oblique shock waves occur when the shock wave is inclined relative to the direction of the flow. These shocks are typically found in supersonic flows over wedges or airfoils, where the flow is deflected by an angle.

   - **Properties Across an Oblique Shock**:
     - The flow behind the shock remains supersonic, though slower than the flow ahead of the shock.
     - The shock angle depends on the wedge angle and the Mach number of the incoming flow.
     - Like normal shocks, pressure, temperature, and density increase, and velocity decreases.

3. **Bow Shock Waves**:
   - A bow shock forms in front of a blunt object moving at supersonic speeds, such as a spacecraft re-entering the Earth's atmosphere. The shock wave takes on a curved shape, wrapping around the object.
   
   - Bow shocks are a type of detached shock, meaning the shock wave stands off from the surface of the object, creating a highly compressed region of gas between the shock and the object.

4. **Expansion Waves vs. Shock Waves**:
   - While shock waves are associated with compression, **expansion waves** occur when the flow expands, resulting in a decrease in pressure, density, and temperature. Expansion waves are typically smooth and continuous, unlike the abrupt nature of shock waves.

### Governing Equations for Shock Waves

The behavior of shock waves can be analyzed using the **conservation equations** for mass, momentum, and energy, combined with the **Rankine-Hugoniot relations**. These relations describe the jump conditions across the shock wave.

1. **Mass Conservation**:
   $$
   \rho_1 u_1 = \rho_2 u_2,
   $$
   where:
   - \( \rho_1 \) and \( \rho_2 \) are the densities before and after the shock.
   - \( u_1 \) and \( u_2 \) are the velocities normal to the shock before and after the shock.

2. **Momentum Conservation**:
   $$
   p_1 + \rho_1 u_1^2 = p_2 + \rho_2 u_2^2,
   $$
   where \( p_1 \) and \( p_2 \) are the pressures before and after the shock.

3. **Energy Conservation**:
   $$
   h_1 + \frac{u_1^2}{2} = h_2 + \frac{u_2^2}{2},
   $$
   where \( h_1 \) and \( h_2 \) are the specific enthalpies before and after the shock.

4. **Entropy Condition**:
   - The second law of thermodynamics dictates that entropy must increase across a shock wave, reflecting the irreversible nature of the process:
     $$
     s_2 > s_1,
     $$
     where \( s_1 \) and \( s_2 \) are the specific entropies before and after the shock.

### Shock Wave Relations

For a **normal shock** in an ideal gas, the relations can be further simplified. Given the upstream Mach number \( M_1 \), the downstream Mach number \( M_2 \) can be found using:

$$
M_2^2 = \frac{M_1^2 + 2/(\gamma - 1)}{2\gamma M_1^2/(\gamma - 1) - 1},
$$

where \( \gamma \) is the ratio of specific heats ([[adiabatic index]]).

Other important relations include:

- **Pressure Ratio**:
  $$
  \frac{p_2}{p_1} = 1 + \frac{2\gamma}{\gamma + 1} (M_1^2 - 1),
  $$

- **Density Ratio**:
  $$
  \frac{\rho_2}{\rho_1} = \frac{(\gamma + 1) M_1^2}{(\gamma - 1) M_1^2 + 2},
  $$

- **Temperature Ratio**:
  $$
  \frac{T_2}{T_1} = \frac{\left[2\gamma M_1^2 - (\gamma - 1)\right] \left[(\gamma - 1) M_1^2 + 2\right]}{(\gamma + 1)^2 M_1^2},
  $$

These relations help in quantifying the changes in fluid properties across the shock.

### Numerical Methods for Shock Waves

Numerical methods for solving compressible fluid dynamics problems must accurately capture shock waves without introducing non-physical oscillations (Gibbs phenomenon). Common methods include:

1. **Godunov's Method**:
   - A finite volume method that solves the Riemann problem at each cell interface, naturally capturing shock waves.

2. **High-Resolution Schemes**:
   - **Total Variation Diminishing (TVD)** and **Essentially Non-Oscillatory (ENO)** schemes are designed to resolve shocks and discontinuities while avoiding spurious oscillations.

3. **Shock-Capturing Methods**:
   - These methods adaptively refine the grid or modify the flux calculation to accurately resolve the shock front.

### Applications

Shock waves are ubiquitous in various fields of science and engineering:

1. **Aerospace Engineering**:
   - Design of supersonic and hypersonic aircraft, where shock waves play a crucial role in determining aerodynamic forces and heating.

2. **Astrophysics**:
   - Supernova explosions and shock waves in stellar winds and interstellar medium.

3. **Explosives and Detonation**:
   - Analysis of shock waves generated by explosions and their impact on surrounding materials.

4. **High-Speed Flows**:
   - Understanding shock waves is crucial for designing nozzles, diffusers, and other components in jet engines and rockets.

### Conclusion

**Shock waves** are a critical aspect of compressible fluid dynamics, characterized by abrupt changes in flow properties. Their analysis requires understanding the governing conservation laws and the resulting Rankine-Hugoniot relations. Accurately capturing shock waves in numerical simulations is a challenging but essential task, especially in fields like aerospace engineering and astrophysics, where high-speed flows are prevalent. The study of shock waves not only provides insights into the behavior of compressible fluids but also has practical applications across a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines.
