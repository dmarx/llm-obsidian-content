Operator Product Expansion


**ASSISTANT**

The Operator Product Expansion (OPE) is a powerful tool in quantum field theory, particularly in conformal field theory (CFT). It expresses the product of two local operators at nearby points as a series of local operators at a single point. This expansion encodes information about the short-distance behavior of field products and is essential for understanding correlation functions and the structure of the theory.

## Overview

### Basic Concept

The OPE states that for two local operators \(\mathcal{O}_i(x)\) and \(\mathcal{O}_j(y)\), as \(x\) approaches \(y\), their product can be expanded as:

$$
\mathcal{O}_i(x) \mathcal{O}_j(y) = \sum_k C_{ij}^k(x - y) \mathcal{O}_k(y)
$$

Here, \(C_{ij}^k(x - y)\) are the OPE coefficients, which are functions of the separation \(x - y\) and encode the singularity structure of the product. The operators \(\mathcal{O}_k(y)\) are local operators evaluated at point \(y\).

### Convergence and Validity

The OPE is an asymptotic expansion valid in the limit where the separation \( |x - y| \) is small. In conformal field theory, the OPE often converges within correlation functions due to the additional structure provided by conformal symmetry.

## OPE in Conformal Field Theory

### Two-Dimensional CFT

In 2D CFT, the OPE takes a particularly simple and elegant form due to the rich symmetry provided by the Virasoro algebra. Consider two primary fields \(\phi_i(z, \bar{z})\) and \(\phi_j(w, \bar{w})\):

$$
\phi_i(z, \bar{z}) \phi_j(w, \bar{w}) = \sum_k C_{ij}^k(z - w, \bar{z} - \bar{w}) \phi_k(w, \bar{w})
$$

Here, \(C_{ij}^k(z - w, \bar{z} - \bar{w})\) are the OPE coefficients, which in 2D CFT take the form:

$$
C_{ij}^k(z - w, \bar{z} - \bar{w}) = \sum_{m, n} \frac{c_{ij}^{k, (m, n)}}{(z - w)^{h_i + h_j - h_k - m} (\bar{z} - \bar{w})^{\bar{h}_i + \bar{h}_j - \bar{h}_k - n}}
$$

where \(h_i, h_j, h_k\) and \(\bar{h}_i, \bar{h}_j, \bar{h}_k\) are the conformal weights of the fields \(\phi_i, \phi_j, \phi_k\).

### Higher-Dimensional CFT

In higher dimensions, the OPE remains a central tool. For two scalar operators \(\mathcal{O}_i(x)\) and \(\mathcal{O}_j(y)\) in a d-dimensional CFT, the OPE is written as:

$$
\mathcal{O}_i(x) \mathcal{O}_j(y) = \sum_k C_{ij}^k(|x - y|) \mathcal{O}_k(y)
$$

The OPE coefficients \(C_{ij}^k(|x - y|)\) depend on the distance \(|x - y|\) and the scaling dimensions of the operators involved. In general, the form of these coefficients is constrained by the symmetries of the theory.

### Structure Constants

The coefficients \(C_{ij}^k\) in the OPE can be decomposed into numerical structure constants \(C_{ij}^k\) and functions of the separation, often involving powers of \((x - y)\). These structure constants are fundamental parameters of the theory and play a crucial role in determining the dynamics of the system.

### Example: Free Scalar Field

For a free scalar field \(\phi(x)\) in 2D, the OPE is given by:

$$
\phi(x) \phi(y) \sim -\frac{1}{4\pi} \ln |x - y|^2 + :\phi(x) \phi(y):
$$

where the term \(:\phi(x) \phi(y):\) denotes the normal-ordered product of the fields.

## Applications

### Calculation of Correlation Functions

The OPE allows the computation of multi-point correlation functions by reducing them to sums of products of lower-point functions. For example, a four-point function can be analyzed by applying the OPE to pairs of operators, thus reducing the problem to the computation of three-point functions.

### Operator Algebra

The OPE encodes the algebra of local operators in the theory, revealing how different operators interact and contribute to physical observables.

### Conformal Bootstrap

The conformal bootstrap program uses the OPE and crossing symmetry to derive non-perturbative constraints on the operator dimensions and structure constants. By demanding consistency of the OPE in different channels of a four-point function, one can derive powerful constraints on the theory.

## Mathematical Formalism

### Radial Quantization

In radial quantization, the OPE can be interpreted as an expansion in the operator basis around a point. This is particularly useful in 2D CFT, where the complex plane is mapped to a cylinder, and time evolution corresponds to scaling transformations.

### Modular Invariance

In 2D CFT, the torus partition function must be invariant under modular transformations, providing constraints on the spectrum and OPE coefficients.

### Ward Identities

Ward identities derived from conformal symmetry can be used to relate OPE coefficients to correlation functions, further constraining the form of the OPE.
