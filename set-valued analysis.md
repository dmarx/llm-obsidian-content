Set-Valued Analysis

### Set-Valued Analysis

Set-valued analysis extends classical analysis to study set-valued maps (also called multifunctions) where each input is mapped to a set of outputs rather than a single output. This field provides essential tools for dealing with optimization, control theory, economics, and other areas where uncertainty or multiple outcomes are modeled.

### Definitions and Basic Concepts

#### Set-Valued Map

A set-valued map (or multifunction) \( F \) from a set \( X \) to the power set of \( Y \), denoted \( F: X \to 2^Y \), assigns to each point \( x \in X \) a set \( F(x) \subseteq Y \).

#### Graph of a Set-Valued Map

The graph of a set-valued map \( F \) is defined as:
$$
\text{graph}(F) = \{ (x, y) \in X \times Y \mid y \in F(x) \}
$$

#### Image and Inverse Image

- **Image**: The image of a set \( A \subseteq X \) under \( F \) is:
  $$
  F(A) = \bigcup_{x \in A} F(x)
  $$
- **Inverse Image**: The inverse image of a set \( B \subseteq Y \) under \( F \) is:
  $$
  F^{-1}(B) = \{ x \in X \mid F(x) \cap B \neq \emptyset \}
  $$

### Properties of Set-Valued Maps

#### Non-emptiness

A set-valued map \( F: X \to 2^Y \) is non-empty if \( F(x) \neq \emptyset \) for all \( x \in X \).

#### Convexity

A set-valued map \( F: X \to 2^Y \) is convex-valued if \( F(x) \) is a convex set for all \( x \in X \).

#### Compactness

A set-valued map \( F: X \to 2^Y \) is compact-valued if \( F(x) \) is a compact set for all \( x \in X \).

#### Upper and Lower Semicontinuity

- **Upper Semicontinuity**: \( F \) is upper semicontinuous at \( x_0 \in X \) if for every open set \( V \) containing \( F(x_0) \), there exists a neighborhood \( U \) of \( x_0 \) such that \( F(x) \subseteq V \) for all \( x \in U \).
- **Lower Semicontinuity**: \( F \) is lower semicontinuous at \( x_0 \in X \) if for every open set \( V \) that intersects \( F(x_0) \), there exists a neighborhood \( U \) of \( x_0 \) such that \( F(x) \cap V \neq \emptyset \) for all \( x \in U \).

### Operations on Set-Valued Maps

#### Minkowski Sum

The Minkowski sum of two set-valued maps \( F \) and \( G \) is defined by:
$$
(F + G)(x) = \{ y + z \mid y \in F(x), z \in G(x) \}
$$

#### Composition

The composition of two set-valued maps \( F: X \to 2^Y \) and \( G: Y \to 2^Z \) is:
$$
(G \circ F)(x) = \bigcup_{y \in F(x)} G(y)
$$

### Set-Valued Differentiation

#### Contingent Derivative

The contingent derivative (or Bouligand derivative) of a set-valued map \( F \) at \( x \) in the direction \( v \) is:
$$
DF(x; v) = \{ w \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid \exists t_k \downarrow 0, v_k \to v, w_k \to w, \text{ such that } \frac{F(x + t_k v_k) - F(x)}{t_k} \to w \}
$$

#### Clarke Derivative

The Clarke derivative extends the notion of the derivative to nonsmooth functions, generalizing the concept for set-valued maps.

### Applications

#### Optimization

In optimization, set-valued maps describe constraint sets or objective functions that can take multiple values. Techniques from set-valued analysis are used to study feasibility, optimality conditions, and solution algorithms.

#### Control Theory

Set-valued analysis is crucial in control theory for modeling systems with uncertainties or where control actions lead to multiple possible outcomes. Differential inclusions are a key application area.

#### Economic Equilibria

In economics, set-valued maps represent preferences, production possibilities, or feasible trades. Fixed-point theorems for set-valued maps are used to prove the existence of economic equilibria.

### Important Theorems

#### Kakutani Fixed-Point Theorem

An extension of the Brouwer fixed-point theorem to set-valued maps, stating that if \( F: X \to 2^X \) is a non-empty, convex, compact-valued, and upper semicontinuous set-valued map on a compact convex set \( X \), then \( F \) has a fixed point.

#### Michael Selection Theorem

If \( F: X \to 2^Y \) is a lower semicontinuous, convex-valued map with non-empty values, and \( X \) is paracompact, then \( F \) has a continuous single-valued selection \( f: X \to Y \) such that \( f(x) \in F(x) \) for all \( x \in X \).

### Example: Control-Affine System

Consider a control-affine system described by the differential inclusion:
$$
\dot{x}(t) \in Ax(t) + Bu(t)
$$
where \( u(t) \) belongs to a set \( U \subseteq \mathbb{R}^m \). The set-valued map \( F(t, x) = Ax + B(t)U \) models the possible dynamics of the system. 

### Conclusion

Set-valued analysis provides a robust framework for extending classical analysis to systems with multiple outcomes or uncertainties. It underpins many applications in optimization, control theory, economics, and more. For further exploration, refer to [[Nonsmooth Analysis]], [[Optimal Control]], and [[Differential Inclusions]].
