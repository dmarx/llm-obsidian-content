Fisher's Runaway Selection


**ASSISTANT**

### Fisher's Runaway Selection

**Fisher's runaway selection** is a hypothesis proposed by the British geneticist Ronald Fisher to explain the evolution of exaggerated male traits through sexual selection. The theory suggests a positive feedback loop between female preference and male trait expression, leading to increasingly exaggerated traits over generations.

#### Mechanism of Runaway Selection

1. **Initial Advantage**: A male trait initially provides a survival or reproductive advantage. Females develop a preference for this trait because it is associated with high fitness.

   $$ \text{Trait (e.g., long tail)} \longrightarrow \text{Increased survival or reproductive success} $$

2. **Genetic Correlation**: The preference for the trait and the trait itself become genetically linked. Daughters inherit the preference for the trait, and sons inherit the trait.

   $$ \text{Genetic linkage: Preference and Trait} $$

3. **Positive Feedback Loop**: Males with the trait are more attractive and have higher reproductive success. This preference causes the trait to become more common in the population, and as the trait becomes more exaggerated, the preference for it strengthens.

   $$ \text{Trait exaggeration} \longrightarrow \text{Increased mating success} $$

4. **Runaway Process**: The trait and the preference for it become self-reinforcing. This runaway process continues until the cost of the exaggerated trait outweighs the reproductive advantage.

   $$ \text{Runaway selection} \longrightarrow \text{Extremely exaggerated traits} $$

#### Mathematical Model of Fisher's Runaway Selection

Fisher's runaway selection can be modeled using quantitative genetics. Consider two traits: a male trait \( T \) and a female preference \( P \). Let \( T \) and \( P \) have a genetic correlation \( r \). The dynamics of the traits can be described using the following equations:

1. **Change in the Male Trait**:
   $$ \Delta T = h_T^2 \cdot S_T $$
   where \( h_T^2 \) is the heritability of the male trait and \( S_T \) is the selection differential on the male trait.

2. **Change in the Female Preference**:
   $$ \Delta P = h_P^2 \cdot S_P $$
   where \( h_P^2 \) is the heritability of the female preference and \( S_P \) is the selection differential on the female preference.

3. **Genetic Correlation**:
   $$ r = \frac{\text{Cov}(T, P)}{\sigma_T \sigma_P} $$
   where \(\text{Cov}(T, P)\) is the covariance between the male trait and the female preference, and \(\sigma_T\) and \(\sigma_P\) are the standard deviations of the male trait and female preference, respectively.

The change in the male trait due to the genetic correlation with female preference can be expressed as:

   $$ \Delta T = h_T^2 \cdot S_T + r \cdot h_P^2 \cdot S_P $$

Similarly, the change in female preference due to the genetic correlation with the male trait is:

   $$ \Delta P = h_P^2 \cdot S_P + r \cdot h_T^2 \cdot S_T $$

These equations show how the male trait and female preference can co-evolve through the positive feedback mechanism of runaway selection.

#### Implications of Fisher's Runaway Selection

1. **Exaggerated Traits**: Runaway selection can lead to the evolution of extremely exaggerated male traits, such as the peacock's tail or the elaborate displays of birds of paradise.

2. **Sexual Dimorphism**: The process can result in significant sexual dimorphism, where males and females exhibit marked differences in appearance and behavior.

3. **Evolutionary Costs**: The runaway process continues until the cost of maintaining the exaggerated trait (e.g., increased predation risk, energy expenditure) balances the reproductive advantage it confers.

4. **Genetic Diversity**: Runaway selection can maintain genetic diversity in both the male trait and female preference, as different combinations of traits and preferences are favored over time.

#### Examples of Runaway Selection

1. **Peacock's Tail**: The peacock's elaborate tail feathers are a classic example of runaway selection. Females prefer males with larger and more colorful tails, leading to the evolution of these exaggerated traits despite their cost.

   $$ \text{Large, colorful tail} \longrightarrow \text{Higher mating success} $$

2. **Birds of Paradise**: Males exhibit highly elaborate courtship displays and plumage. These traits have evolved through female preference, resulting in extreme sexual dimorphism.

   $$ \text{Elaborate display} \longrightarrow \text{Higher mating success} $$

3. **Stalk-eyed Flies**: In some species of flies, males have eyes on the ends of long stalks. Females prefer males with longer eye stalks, driving the evolution of this exaggerated trait.

   $$ \text{Long eye stalks} \longrightarrow \text{Higher mating success} $$

### Summary

Fisher's runaway selection explains the evolution of exaggerated male traits through a positive feedback loop between female preference and trait expression. This process can lead to significant sexual dimorphism and the development of traits that are highly advantageous for mating success, even if they pose survival costs. Understanding runaway selection provides insights into the mechanisms driving the evolution of complex and elaborate traits in the animal kingdom.
