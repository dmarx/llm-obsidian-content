Joint Planning Process (JPP)


**ASSISTANT**

The **Joint Planning Process (JPP)** is a structured methodology used by joint military forces to develop comprehensive plans and orders for joint operations. The JPP is designed to integrate the efforts of multiple military services (e.g., Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines) and other partners to achieve strategic and operational objectives in a coordinated and unified manner. It ensures that all elements of a joint force are aligned and working toward common goals, and it provides a systematic approach to planning that enhances the effectiveness of joint military operations.

## Objectives of the Joint Planning Process (JPP)

1. **Integrate Efforts Across Services**: Ensure that all branches of the military and other stakeholders (e.g., coalition partners, interagency organizations) are working together seamlessly to achieve unified objectives.
2. **Align Operational Planning with Strategic Goals**: Connect operational-level planning with higher strategic objectives to ensure that all actions contribute to overarching national or coalition goals.
3. **Enhance Coordination and Synchronization**: Foster coordination and synchronization among all components of the joint force to maximize operational effectiveness and prevent fratricide or misallocation of resources.
4. **Support Commander's Decision-Making**: Provide a structured framework for commanders to analyze the operational environment, evaluate options, and make informed decisions.
5. **Promote Flexibility and Adaptability**: Enable planners to develop multiple [[courses of action]] (COAs) and prepare for various contingencies, ensuring flexibility and adaptability in the face of changing conditions.

## Steps of the Joint Planning Process (JPP)

The JPP consists of seven steps, each designed to systematically analyze the situation, develop and evaluate COAs, and produce a comprehensive plan or order. Here is an overview of each step:

### 1. **Initiation**

**Purpose**: To establish the context and foundation for planning by receiving and analyzing strategic guidance from higher authorities.

- **Tasks**:
  - **Receive Strategic Direction**: Obtain strategic guidance and directives from higher authorities, such as the President, Secretary of Defense, or Joint Chiefs of Staff. This includes understanding the desired end state, objectives, and limitations.
  - **Conduct Initial Planning Activities**: Assemble the planning team, review existing plans and orders, and determine the planning timeline and milestones.
  - **Issue Initial Planning Guidance**: Provide initial guidance to the planning team and subordinate commands to start the planning process.

- **Outputs**:
  - Planning team assembled and initial planning timeline established.
  - Initial planning guidance issued to subordinate commands.
  - Clear understanding of strategic objectives and desired end state.

### 2. **Mission Analysis**

**Purpose**: To thoroughly analyze the mission to determine its requirements, constraints, and opportunities, and to develop a clear understanding of the commander’s intent and the desired end state.

- **Tasks**:
  - **Analyze Strategic Guidance**: Review and analyze strategic directives, policies, and higher headquarters orders to understand the mission’s context and purpose.
  - **Identify Specified and Implied Tasks**: Determine tasks explicitly stated in the directive (specified tasks) and those that must be accomplished to achieve the mission (implied tasks).
  - **Determine Constraints and Limitations**: Identify any constraints (actions that must be taken) and limitations (actions that cannot be taken) that impact the mission.
  - **Assess the Operational Environment**: Evaluate the operational environment, including the enemy, terrain, weather, and civil considerations, to identify key factors that could impact the mission.
  - **Develop Initial Risk Assessment**: Identify potential risks to mission success and develop initial mitigation measures.

- **Outputs**:
  - Mission statement developed that clearly defines the who, what, where, when, and why of the operation.
  - Initial commander’s intent and planning guidance.
  - List of specified and implied tasks, constraints, and limitations.
  - Initial risk assessment and mitigation measures.

### 3. **Course of Action (COA) Development**

**Purpose**: To develop multiple COAs that provide different options for achieving the mission objectives, allowing for flexibility and adaptability.

- **Tasks**:
  - **Develop COAs**: Create multiple feasible, acceptable, and suitable COAs that offer distinct approaches to achieving the mission. Each COA should provide a different method for solving the operational problem and achieving the desired end state.
  - **Consider Key Factors**: Ensure that each COA accounts for the operational environment, the enemy, friendly forces, terrain, and other relevant factors.
  - **Incorporate Joint Functions**: Integrate all joint functions (command and control, intelligence, fires, movement and maneuver, protection, sustainment) into each COA to ensure a comprehensive approach.

- **Outputs**:
  - A set of developed COAs, each with a narrative description, sketch, and synchronization matrix.
  - Consideration of joint functions in each COA.

### 4. **Course of Action (COA) Analysis and Wargaming**

**Purpose**: To analyze each COA in detail by simulating its execution to identify potential strengths, weaknesses, risks, and opportunities.

- **Tasks**:
  - **Conduct Wargaming**: Simulate each COA’s execution in a dynamic environment, considering enemy actions, friendly actions, terrain, and other factors. This helps visualize the operation and identify potential challenges and opportunities.
  - **Evaluate the COA**: Assess the effectiveness of each COA by analyzing its feasibility, acceptability, and suitability. Identify decision points, risks, and potential branches and sequels.
  - **Identify Critical Events and Decision Points**: Determine key events and decision points that will influence the success of the operation and require command attention.

- **Outputs**:
  - Refined COAs based on wargaming results.
  - List of decision points, critical events, branches, and sequels.
  - Updated risk assessment and mitigation measures.

### 5. **Course of Action (COA) Comparison**

**Purpose**: To evaluate and compare all COAs against a set of criteria to determine the most effective option for achieving the mission objectives.

- **Tasks**:
  - **Develop Evaluation Criteria**: Establish criteria for comparing COAs, such as risk, feasibility, cost, time, and alignment with the commander’s intent and mission objectives.
  - **Compare COAs**: Use a decision matrix to assess each COA against the established criteria, assigning weights to each criterion based on its importance.
  - **Analyze Results**: Compare the results to determine the relative advantages and disadvantages of each COA and identify the COA that offers the best chance of success.

- **Outputs**:
  - Decision matrix with evaluated COAs.
  - Recommended COA based on the comparison and analysis.
  - Updated risk assessment highlighting the risks associated with each COA.

### 6. **Course of Action (COA) Approval**

**Purpose**: To present the recommended COA to the commander for approval and obtain final guidance.

- **Tasks**:
  - **Present COA Analysis**: Brief the commander on the results of the COA comparison, including the analysis, evaluation criteria, and recommended COA. Highlight key risks, advantages, and disadvantages of each COA.
  - **Obtain COA Approval**: The commander reviews the options and selects the preferred COA based on the analysis and input from the staff. The commander may approve the recommended COA or direct modifications.
  - **Issue Final Guidance**: Provide any additional guidance needed to refine the plan or address specific concerns.

- **Outputs**:
  - Commander’s decision on the selected COA.
  - Final commander’s guidance and intent refined.
  - Updated planning guidance for final plan development.

### 7. **Plan or Order Development**

**Purpose**: To develop a detailed plan or order based on the approved COA and ensure that all subordinate units understand their roles and responsibilities.

- **Tasks**:
  - **Develop the Plan or Order**: Create a detailed operational plan (OPLAN) or operation order (OPORD) based on the selected COA. This includes all necessary annexes, graphics, and supporting documents.
  - **Coordinate with Subordinate Units**: Ensure that all subordinate units and supporting elements understand the plan and their specific tasks and responsibilities.
  - **Disseminate the Plan or Order**: Issue the OPLAN or OPORD to all relevant units and stakeholders, providing clear guidance for execution.

- **Outputs**:
  - Final OPLAN or OPORD with all necessary annexes and graphics.
  - Subordinate units and supporting elements prepared for execution.
  - Finalized synchronization matrix and execution timeline.
