### Laplace’s Law of Succession

[[Pierre-Simon Laplace]]’s **Law of Succession** is a classical result in probability theory that provides a way to estimate the probability of an event occurring based on previous observations. It's often viewed as an early application of Bayesian reasoning, predating modern Bayesian statistics.

### Problem Setup

Consider an experiment that results in either a "success" or a "failure" (a binary outcome), like flipping a coin. Suppose we have observed the experiment $n$ times, where $s$ of these trials resulted in a "success" and $(n - s)$ resulted in a "failure." Now, the key question is: **What is the probability that the next trial will result in a success?**

Laplace’s Law of Succession provides a formula to estimate this probability under the assumption that we have no prior knowledge about the likelihood of success or failure before the observations.

### Laplace's Rule for the Probability of Success

Let’s assume the binary outcomes are governed by some unknown probability $\theta$, where:

$$ \theta = P(\text{success in a single trial}). $$

Using a Bayesian framework, we treat $\theta$ as a random variable and assign it a prior distribution. Laplace assumed a **uniform prior** for $\theta$ over the interval $[0, 1]$, meaning that all values of $\theta$ are equally likely a priori. The uniform prior is represented as:

$$ p(\theta) = 1 \quad \text{for} \quad \theta \in [0, 1]. $$

After observing $s$ successes and $n - s$ failures, the **posterior distribution** for $\theta$ (using Bayes' theorem) follows a **Beta distribution**:

$$ p(\theta | s, n) = \text{Beta}(s + 1, n - s + 1). $$

The **expected value** of $\theta$ under this posterior distribution is the estimate for the probability of success in the next trial:

$$ P(\text{success next trial} | s \text{ successes}, n \text{ trials}) = \mathbb{E}[\theta | s, n] = \frac{s + 1}{n + 2}. $$

### Formula and Interpretation

The formula that Laplace derived for the probability of success in the next trial is:

$$ P(\text{success next trial}) = \frac{s + 1}{n + 2}. $$

Where:
- $s$ is the number of observed successes,
- $n$ is the total number of trials.

This result is called Laplace’s **Law of Succession**.

### Example: Predicting the Sun Rising

Laplace famously applied the Law of Succession to the question of whether the sun will rise tomorrow. Assume that the sun has risen every day for the past $n$ days (so, $s = n$ and no failures have been observed). According to the Law of Succession, the probability that the sun will rise again tomorrow is:

$$ P(\text{sun rises tomorrow}) = \frac{n + 1}{n + 2}. $$

If the sun has risen every day for 5,000 years (roughly $n = 1,825,000$ days), then:

$$ P(\text{sun rises tomorrow}) = \frac{1,825,001}{1,825,002} \approx 0.99999945. $$

This illustrates how the probability of the event (the sun rising tomorrow) becomes very close to 1 as $n$ grows larger.

### Relation to Bayesian Inference

Laplace’s Law of Succession is an early form of **Bayesian inference**. He starts with a **non-informative prior** (a uniform distribution over $\theta$) and updates the prior based on observed data to obtain a posterior distribution. The final result is an estimate for the probability of a future event, incorporating both prior assumptions and empirical observations.

In modern Bayesian terminology, this corresponds to:
- A **Beta(1, 1)** prior for $\theta$ (which is equivalent to a uniform distribution on $[0, 1]$),
- A **Beta(s + 1, n - s + 1)** posterior after $n$ observations, of which $s$ are successes.

The expected value of this posterior distribution gives the probability estimate $\frac{s + 1}{n + 2}$.

### Key Assumptions

1. **Uniform Prior**: Laplace assumes we have no prior knowledge about the success probability $\theta$, and hence assigns it a uniform distribution over $[0, 1]$. This is a crucial assumption that reflects complete ignorance about the process before observing any data.
   
2. **Independent and Identically Distributed (i.i.d.) Trials**: The Law of Succession assumes that each trial is independent and that the probability of success remains the same across trials.

### Generalization

The Law of Succession can be generalized beyond binary outcomes by considering Dirichlet priors instead of Beta distributions. In this general case, Laplace's rule would be adapted to multi-category problems, where there are more than two possible outcomes per trial.

### Limitations

While Laplace’s Law of Succession is elegant, it has some limitations:
- It assumes a uniform prior, which may not always be appropriate. If we have more prior information about the process, other priors (like a Beta distribution with different parameters) may be more suitable.
- The assumption of independence between trials may not hold in many real-world scenarios.

### Summary

Laplace's **Law of Succession** provides a simple Bayesian rule to estimate the probability of success for the next trial in a series of independent binary trials. The estimated probability is:

$$ P(\text{success next trial}) = \frac{s + 1}{n + 2}, $$

where $s$ is the number of successes observed in $n$ trials. This result is an early example of Bayesian inference and reflects the use of prior knowledge (or lack thereof) in estimating future probabilities.

**ASSISTANT**

The **Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution** is a cornerstone of statistical mechanics, describing the distribution of particle velocities in a gas at thermal equilibrium. [[James Clerk Maxwell]] introduced this result in 1859, and later [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] extended it to include energy distributions. Maxwell's derivation used symmetry arguments and implicit probabilistic reasoning to address how particles move in a gas, particularly when considering the random, chaotic nature of their motion.

### Background: Kinetic Theory of Gases

The kinetic theory of gases models a gas as a large collection of particles (atoms or molecules) that move randomly and interact via elastic collisions. The macroscopic properties of gases, such as pressure and temperature, are statistical results of the microscopic behavior of these particles. 

Maxwell sought to describe the **distribution of particle velocities** in such a gas, which he did by considering the following assumptions:
- **Particles are indistinguishable**: The individual identities of gas molecules do not matter. The system is symmetric under permutations of particles.
- **Random, chaotic motion**: The motion of the gas particles is random, and each direction of motion (e.g., $x$, $y$, $z$) is equally likely.
- **Elastic collisions**: When particles collide, they conserve kinetic energy.
- **No preferred direction**: The system is isotropic, meaning the velocities of the particles should be symmetrically distributed with respect to direction.

### Key Symmetry Considerations in Maxwell's Derivation

1. **Isotropy of Space**: Because there is no preferred direction in space, the velocity distribution must be the same in all directions. This means that the probability of finding a particle with a velocity component $v_x$ in the $x$-direction should be the same as that for $v_y$ in the $y$-direction or $v_z$ in the $z$-direction.

    Therefore, the velocity distribution can be written as a function of the magnitude of the velocity, not its individual components:
    $$ f(v_x, v_y, v_z) = f(v). $$

2. **Independence of Velocity Components**: Maxwell assumed that the velocity components along each axis ($v_x$, $v_y$, $v_z$) are independent of each other. This assumption simplifies the problem greatly, as the total velocity distribution $f(v_x, v_y, v_z)$ can be expressed as the product of three separate functions, each depending on one component of the velocity:
    $$ f(v_x, v_y, v_z) = f_x(v_x) f_y(v_y) f_z(v_z). $$

    By symmetry, these functions must be the same, so:
    $$ f_x(v_x) = f_y(v_y) = f_z(v_z) = f_1(v), $$
    where $f_1(v)$ is some common function for the velocity component in each direction.

3. **Form of the Velocity Distribution**: To find the form of $f(v_x)$, Maxwell considered the requirement that the total probability must integrate to 1 over all possible velocities. This leads to the following normalization condition:
    $$ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f_1(v_x) dv_x = 1. $$

    Additionally, the distribution must account for the fact that the total energy of a gas particle is proportional to the square of its velocity components:
    $$ E = \frac{1}{2} m (v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2). $$

    Therefore, the probability of a given velocity should depend on the energy, which leads to the assumption that $f_1(v_x)$ takes an exponential form (since exponential distributions are often tied to energy distributions):
    $$ f_1(v_x) \propto \exp\left(-\frac{m v_x^2}{2 k_B T}\right). $$

    Here, $m$ is the mass of a particle, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. This form reflects the fact that higher velocities (and therefore higher kinetic energies) are less likely.

4. **Final Distribution**: Since the velocity distribution is isotropic, we combine the results for each velocity component to obtain the total distribution in three dimensions. The probability of finding a particle with a total velocity $v = \sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2}$ is:
    $$ f(v) = 4\pi \left(\frac{m}{2\pi k_B T}\right)^{3/2} v^2 \exp\left(-\frac{m v^2}{2 k_B T}\right). $$

    This is the **Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution**, where:
    - The factor $4\pi v^2$ comes from converting the velocity components to spherical coordinates, as we are interested in the magnitude of the velocity.
    - The exponential term $\exp(-mv^2 / 2k_B T)$ ensures that higher velocities are less probable, consistent with the fact that most particles in a gas have kinetic energies near the thermal average, while very high kinetic energies (and hence very high velocities) are rare.

### Physical Interpretation

The **Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution** describes the probability density function for the magnitude of particle velocities in a gas. The distribution has the following key features:
- **Most probable speed**: The most probable speed, or the speed at which the maximum number of particles are moving, is given by:
    $$ v_{\text{mp}} = \sqrt{\frac{2k_B T}{m}}. $$
  
- **Mean speed**: The average speed of the particles is slightly higher than the most probable speed:
    $$ \langle v \rangle = \sqrt{\frac{8k_B T}{\pi m}}. $$

- **Root-mean-square (rms) speed**: The root-mean-square speed, related to the kinetic energy, is:
    $$ v_{\text{rms}} = \sqrt{\frac{3k_B T}{m}}. $$

These quantities illustrate how the particle velocities are distributed around a central value, with most particles having speeds close to the most probable speed, and fewer particles having very low or very high velocities.

### Probabilistic Reasoning in Maxwell's Derivation

Although Maxwell's original derivation did not explicitly invoke modern probability theory, it used implicit probabilistic reasoning:

1. **Independence of variables**: Maxwell assumed that the velocities in each direction are independent random variables, which is a fundamental probabilistic assumption.
  
2. **Symmetry and Isotropy**: The assumption of no preferred direction in space (isotropy) leads to the idea that the velocity distribution must be the same in all directions, a principle that mirrors the probabilistic concept of exchangeability—any one particle’s velocity is as likely as another’s, and any component of velocity behaves the same as another.

3. **Exponential decay of probability**: The form of the distribution, with a Gaussian (exponential) dependence on velocity, reflects probabilistic reasoning related to the behavior of random variables. Higher velocities are exponentially less likely, which is a hallmark of distributions that describe energy dissipation or random motion in large systems.

### Connection to Statistical Mechanics

Maxwell’s derivation laid the foundation for **statistical mechanics**, a field developed by Boltzmann, Gibbs, and others, which describes macroscopic thermodynamic properties using probabilistic methods applied to microscopic systems. In statistical mechanics:
- The **Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution** describes how particles in a gas distribute their velocities and hence their kinetic energies.
- The distribution is a special case of the **Boltzmann distribution**, which gives the probability of a system being in a particular state as a function of its energy.

### Conclusion

Maxwell’s introduction of the velocity distribution was a groundbreaking step in applying probabilistic reasoning to physical systems. His use of symmetry, independence, and isotropy provided a deep insight into how particles behave in a gas, and the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution became a key result in both kinetic theory and statistical mechanics.
