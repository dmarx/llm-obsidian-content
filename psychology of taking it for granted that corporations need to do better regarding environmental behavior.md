# The Psychology of Taking It for Granted That Corporations Need to "Do Better" Regarding Environmental Behavior

In contemporary society, there is a growing expectation that corporations should be held accountable for their environmental impact and should strive to improve their environmental behavior. This expectation is rooted in several psychological, social, and cultural factors that shape public attitudes and beliefs about corporate responsibility. Understanding these factors can help explain why the demand for better environmental behavior from corporations is often taken for granted.

## Key Psychological and Social Factors

### 1. Environmental Awareness and Education
- **Increasing Knowledge:** Greater public awareness and education about environmental issues, such as climate change, pollution, and resource depletion, contribute to the expectation that corporations need to improve their environmental practices.
- **Examples:** Educational programs, documentaries, and media coverage highlighting the environmental impact of corporate activities.

### 2. Social Norms and Values
- **Evolving Norms:** Social norms and values have evolved to place greater importance on environmental sustainability and corporate social responsibility (CSR).
- **Examples:** Cultural shifts towards valuing green practices, such as recycling, renewable energy, and sustainable consumption.

### 3. Moral and Ethical Considerations
- **Moral Responsibility:** There is a widespread belief that corporations have a moral and ethical obligation to protect the environment and reduce their negative impact.
- **Examples:** Ethical consumerism, where individuals prefer to purchase from companies with strong environmental credentials.

### 4. Attribution of Responsibility
- **Perceived Power and Influence:** Corporations are perceived to have significant power and resources to effect positive environmental change, leading to higher expectations for their behavior.
- **Examples:** Expectations that large companies like Google, Amazon, and ExxonMobil should lead in adopting sustainable practices.

### 5. Trust and Credibility
- **Reputation Management:** Corporations are aware that their reputation and credibility can be severely damaged by poor environmental practices, prompting them to strive for better behavior.
- **Examples:** Companies investing in green technologies and sustainability initiatives to maintain a positive public image.

### 6. Social Pressure and Activism
- **Activist Movements:** Environmental activism and advocacy groups apply pressure on corporations to improve their environmental practices.
- **Examples:** Campaigns by organizations like Greenpeace and Fridays for Future demanding corporate accountability.

### 7. Regulatory and Legal Frameworks
- **Government Regulations:** Increasing environmental regulations and legal requirements force corporations to adopt better environmental practices.
- **Examples:** Laws on emissions reductions, waste management, and resource conservation.

## Psychological Theories and Concepts

### 1. Social Cognitive Theory
- **Core Idea:** People learn and adopt behaviors by observing others and modeling their actions, particularly those of influential entities like corporations.
- **Implications:** Corporations adopting better environmental practices can influence public behavior and reinforce social norms around sustainability.

### 2. Theory of Planned Behavior
- **Core Idea:** Behavioral intentions are influenced by attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control.
- **Implications:** Positive attitudes towards environmental responsibility, strong social norms, and the belief that corporations can control their environmental impact drive the expectation for better corporate behavior.

### 3. Moral Foundations Theory
- **Core Idea:** Peopleâ€™s moral judgments are based on different foundations, such as harm/care and fairness/cheating.
- **Implications:** Environmental degradation is seen as causing harm and being unfair, triggering moral outrage and demands for corporate improvement.

### 4. Cognitive Dissonance Theory
- **Core Idea:** People experience discomfort (dissonance) when their beliefs and behaviors are inconsistent, motivating them to change one to match the other.
- **Implications:** Public awareness of corporate environmental harm creates dissonance with values of sustainability, leading to increased pressure on corporations to change.

### 5. Attribution Theory
- **Core Idea:** People attribute responsibility for outcomes to internal (dispositional) or external (situational) factors.
- **Implications:** Corporations are often seen as having internal control over their environmental practices, leading to higher expectations for them to improve.

## Practical Implications and Strategies

### 1. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Initiatives
- **Implementation:** Corporations can develop and implement comprehensive CSR strategies that focus on sustainability and environmental stewardship.
- **Techniques:** Investing in renewable energy, reducing waste and emissions, sustainable sourcing, and transparency in reporting environmental impact.

### 2. Public Engagement and Communication
- **Implementation:** Companies should engage with the public and communicate their environmental efforts effectively.
- **Techniques:** Public awareness campaigns, sustainability reports, and social media engagement.

### 3. Collaboration with Stakeholders
- **Implementation:** Collaborate with governments, NGOs, and communities to enhance environmental initiatives.
- **Techniques:** Partnerships for sustainable development projects, joint research on green technologies, and community engagement programs.

### 4. Regulatory Compliance and Advocacy
- **Implementation:** Ensure compliance with environmental regulations and advocate for stronger environmental policies.
- **Techniques:** Regular environmental audits, participation in policy dialogues, and support for environmental legislation.

### 5. Employee Engagement and Training
- **Implementation:** Engage employees in sustainability efforts and provide training on environmental best practices.
- **Techniques:** Green teams, sustainability training programs, and employee-led environmental initiatives.

### 6. Ethical Marketing and Consumer Education
- **Implementation:** Use ethical marketing practices to promote environmentally friendly products and educate consumers.
- **Techniques:** Eco-labeling, transparent advertising, and consumer education campaigns.

## Conclusion

The expectation that corporations need to "do better" regarding environmental behavior is rooted in a combination of psychological, social, and cultural factors. Increasing environmental awareness, evolving social norms, moral and ethical considerations, perceived corporate responsibility, social pressure, and regulatory frameworks all contribute to this widespread demand. By understanding these factors and applying relevant psychological theories, corporations can develop effective strategies to improve their environmental behavior and meet public expectations. Implementing comprehensive CSR initiatives, engaging with stakeholders, ensuring regulatory compliance, and fostering a culture of sustainability within the organization are essential steps towards achieving better environmental outcomes and maintaining public trust and credibility.
