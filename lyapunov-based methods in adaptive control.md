### Lyapunov-Based Methods in Adaptive Control

Lyapunov-based methods are a foundational approach in [[adaptive control]], providing a systematic way to ensure stability by designing adaptation laws that guarantee the derivative of a Lyapunov function is negative semi-definite. This approach leverages the direct method of Lyapunov to derive stable adaptation laws.

### Key Concepts

1. **Lyapunov Function**: A scalar function \( V(x, \theta) \) that is positive definite and decreases along system trajectories, ensuring system stability.
2. **Stability Criteria**: The derivative of the Lyapunov function \( \dot{V}(x, \theta) \) should be negative semi-definite to ensure stability.
3. **Adaptation Law**: A rule that updates the controller parameters based on the system's state to minimize the Lyapunov function and ensure stability.

### Lyapunov Function

A typical Lyapunov function for [[adaptive control]] consists of terms representing both the tracking error and the parameter estimation error. For example, for a system with state \( x \) and parameter vector \( \theta \), a common choice is:
$$
V(e, \tilde{\theta}) = \frac{1}{2} e^T P e + \frac{1}{2} \tilde{\theta}^T \Gamma^{-1} \tilde{\theta},
$$
where:
- \( e = x - x_m \) is the tracking error between the system state \( x \) and the reference model state \( x_m \).
- \( \tilde{\theta} = \theta - \theta^* \) is the parameter estimation error.
- \( P \) is a positive definite matrix.
- \( \Gamma \) is a positive definite adaptation gain matrix.

### Ensuring Stability

The derivative of the Lyapunov function along the system trajectories should be negative semi-definite:
$$
\dot{V}(e, \tilde{\theta}) \leq 0.
$$

### Example: MRAC for a First-Order System

Consider a first-order system:
$$
\dot{x}(t) = -a x(t) + b u(t),
$$
with unknown parameters \( a \) and \( b \).

#### Reference Model

The desired system behavior is specified by the reference model:
$$
\dot{x}_m(t) = -a_m x_m(t) + b_m r(t),
$$
where \( a_m \) and \( b_m \) are chosen to reflect the desired dynamics.

#### Control Law

The control input is given by:
$$
u(t) = \theta_1(t) r(t) + \theta_2(t) x(t),
$$
where \( \theta_1(t) \) and \( \theta_2(t) \) are adaptive parameters.

#### Adaptation Law

To derive the adaptation law, we define the tracking error:
$$
e(t) = x(t) - x_m(t).
$$

A common choice for the Lyapunov function is:
$$
V(e, \tilde{\theta}) = \frac{1}{2} e^2 + \frac{1}{2\gamma} \tilde{\theta}^T \tilde{\theta},
$$
where \( \tilde{\theta} = \theta - \theta^* \) and \( \gamma \) is a positive adaptation gain.

Taking the time derivative of \( V \):
$$
\dot{V} = e \dot{e} + \frac{1}{\gamma} \tilde{\theta}^T \dot{\tilde{\theta}}.
$$

Using the system dynamics and control law:
$$
\dot{e} = \dot{x} - \dot{x}_m = -a x + b u - (-a_m x_m + b_m r).
$$

Substitute the control law:
$$
\dot{e} = -a x + b (\theta_1 r + \theta_2 x) - (-a_m x_m + b_m r).
$$

To simplify, we use the ideal parameters \( \theta_1^* \) and \( \theta_2^* \) that perfectly match the reference model:
$$
\theta_1^* = \frac{b_m}{b}, \quad \theta_2^* = \frac{a_m}{b} - \frac{a}{b}.
$$

Thus,
$$
\dot{e} = -a x + b (\theta_1 r + \theta_2 x) - b (\theta_1^* r + \theta_2^* x).
$$

Substitute \( \tilde{\theta}_1 = \theta_1 - \theta_1^* \) and \( \tilde{\theta}_2 = \theta_2 - \theta_2^* \):
$$
\dot{e} = b (\tilde{\theta}_1 r + \tilde{\theta}_2 x).
$$

Now,
$$
\dot{V} = e b (\tilde{\theta}_1 r + \tilde{\theta}_2 x) + \frac{1}{\gamma} \tilde{\theta}^T \dot{\tilde{\theta}}.
$$

Choose the adaptation laws:
$$
\dot{\theta}_1 = -\gamma r e, \quad \dot{\theta}_2 = -\gamma x e.
$$

Then,
$$
\dot{\tilde{\theta}}_1 = -\gamma r e, \quad \dot{\tilde{\theta}}_2 = -\gamma x e.
$$

Thus,
$$
\frac{1}{\gamma} \tilde{\theta}^T \dot{\tilde{\theta}} = -\tilde{\theta}_1 r e - \tilde{\theta}_2 x e.
$$

So,
$$
\dot{V} = e b (\tilde{\theta}_1 r + \tilde{\theta}_2 x) - \tilde{\theta}_1 r e - \tilde{\theta}_2 x e.
$$

Simplifying, we get:
$$
\dot{V} = e \left( b (\tilde{\theta}_1 r + \tilde{\theta}_2 x) - (\tilde{\theta}_1 r + \tilde{\theta}_2 x) \right).
$$

Since \( b > 0 \), we can ensure \( b (\tilde{\theta}_1 r + \tilde{\theta}_2 x) - (\tilde{\theta}_1 r + \tilde{\theta}_2 x) \leq 0 \), making \( \dot{V} \leq 0 \).

### Conclusion

Lyapunov-based methods in [[adaptive control]] provide a robust framework for designing adaptation laws that ensure stability. By constructing a Lyapunov function and deriving adaptation laws to make its derivative negative semi-definite, these methods guarantee system stability and robust performance. This approach is widely applicable in [[adaptive control]], particularly in Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC) and other adaptive systems.
