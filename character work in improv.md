## Character Work in Improv

### Definition

**Character work** in improv refers to the development and portrayal of distinct characters with unique personalities, physicalities, voices, and emotional states. Effective character work helps to create depth in scenes, make interactions more dynamic, and engage the audience.

### Key Concepts

1. **Physicality**:
    - How a character carries themselves, their posture, gestures, and movements.
    - Example: A timid character might hunch their shoulders and avoid eye contact, while a confident character stands tall and makes bold gestures.

2. **Voice**:
    - The tone, pitch, pace, and accent of the character's speech.
    - Example: A villainous character might have a deep, slow, and menacing voice, whereas an excited child character might speak quickly with a high-pitched tone.

3. **Emotional State**:
    - The character’s underlying emotions and how they react to situations.
    - Example: A character who is perpetually anxious might wring their hands and speak with a stammer, while a joyful character might have a constant smile and a cheerful tone.

4. **Objectives and Motivations**:
    - What the character wants to achieve and why.
    - Example: A detective character might be motivated by a strong sense of justice, always looking for clues and questioning others.

5. **Background and Relationships**:
    - The character’s history, experiences, and their relationships with other characters.
    - Example: A character who grew up in a wealthy family might have an air of entitlement and speak about high-class experiences, while a character with a close sibling might often reference shared memories.

### Techniques for Developing Characters

1. **Character Walks**:
    - Performers walk around the space embodying different characters, focusing on how their movements change based on their traits.
    - Exercise: Walk as a character who is extremely tired, then switch to a character who is hyperactive. Note how your posture, pace, and gestures change.

2. **Voice Exploration**:
    - Experimenting with different vocal qualities to find a character's voice.
    - Exercise: Read a simple sentence ("I can’t believe it’s already noon!") in various voices: a grumpy old man, an excited teenager, a strict teacher.

3. **Emotional Recall**:
    - Drawing on personal experiences to evoke genuine emotions in character work.
    - Exercise: Recall a time when you felt a strong emotion (joy, anger, fear) and use that feeling to inform a character’s reaction in a scene.

4. **Hot Seating**:
    - One performer sits in character and answers questions from other performers to delve deeper into the character’s background and motivations.
    - Exercise: Answer questions like "What is your biggest fear?" or "What was your happiest memory?" while staying in character.

5. **Status Exercises**:
    - Playing with high and low status to explore power dynamics and character interactions.
    - Exercise: Perform a scene where one character is of high status (a boss) and the other is of low status (an intern), then switch roles and see how it affects behavior and interactions.

### Practical Application in Improv Scenes

1. **Consistent Physicality and Voice**:
    - Maintaining the same physical and vocal traits throughout the scene to ensure character consistency.
    - Example: If a character starts the scene with a limp and a British accent, they should maintain these traits throughout the scene.

2. **Reacting In Character**:
    - Ensuring that all reactions and decisions are true to the character’s established traits and motivations.
    - Example: A cautious character might hesitate and ask many questions before agreeing to a risky plan.

3. **Building Relationships**:
    - Using character backgrounds and relationships to add depth to interactions.
    - Example: Two characters who are siblings might have a playful and teasing dynamic, referencing shared childhood experiences.

4. **Objective-Driven Actions**:
    - Characters pursuing their objectives can drive the plot and create conflict.
    - Example: A character determined to win a bet might take increasingly desperate actions to ensure their victory.

### Exercises to Practice Character Work

1. **Character Interviews**:
    - Performers take turns being interviewed in character, answering questions about their lives, habits, and motivations.
    - Exercise: Interview a character about their typical day, dreams, and fears, delving into specifics to flesh out their personality.

2. **Character Swap**:
    - Performers create a character, then switch roles and portray each other’s characters, focusing on maintaining consistency.
    - Exercise: Develop a character with specific traits, then switch and see how well you can mimic each other's characterizations.

3. **Emotion Underneath**:
    - Performers play a scene where the subtext (underlying emotion) differs from the text (spoken words).
    - Exercise: Perform a scene where characters are arguing about a trivial matter (e.g., where to eat) but the underlying emotion is love and concern.

### Summary

Character work in improv involves developing distinct and believable characters through physicality, voice, emotional states, objectives, and relationships. Techniques such as character walks, voice exploration, emotional recall, hot seating, and status exercises help performers create rich and dynamic characters. Effective character work enhances scenes by ensuring consistency, driving actions through character objectives, and building nuanced relationships, ultimately creating more engaging and immersive performances. Regular practice and exercises help performers refine these skills and bring their characters to life.
