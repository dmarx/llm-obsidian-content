### Longuet-Higgins and Stewart (1962)

The 1962 paper by **Michael S. Longuet-Higgins** and **Robert W. Stewart** is a seminal work in the field of [[oceanography]] and coastal engineering, particularly known for introducing the concept of **radiation stress** and analyzing how waves generate and interact with currents in coastal waters. This paper laid the groundwork for understanding the interactions between surface [[gravity waves]] and the mean flow of water, leading to insights into wave setup, wave-driven currents, and other coastal processes.

### Key Contributions of the Paper

1. **Radiation Stress Concept**:
   - **Definition**: Longuet-Higgins and Stewart introduced the concept of radiation stress to quantify the momentum flux associated with surface [[gravity waves]]. Radiation stress represents the additional momentum transferred through the fluid due to the presence of waves, compared to a situation without waves.
   - **Mathematical Formulation**: They formulated the components of the radiation stress tensor, describing how the wave energy flux and wave-induced momentum interact with the mean flow. This tensor has components corresponding to the normal and tangential forces exerted by the waves on a given area of the fluid surface.

2. **Wave Setup and Setdown**:
   - **Wave Setup**: They analyzed how the gradients in radiation stress lead to changes in the mean water level near the shore, a phenomenon known as wave setup. As waves break and dissipate energy, the radiation stress decreases shoreward, leading to a rise in the mean water level near the coast.
   - **Wave Setdown**: Conversely, in deeper water, before waves begin to break, a reduction in wave height can lead to a decrease in radiation stress, causing a lowering of the mean water level, known as wave setdown.

3. **Wave-Driven Currents**:
   - **Generation of Currents**: The paper detailed how gradients in radiation stress generate wave-driven currents, such as longshore currents and rip currents. These currents are critical in sediment transport and the morphodynamics of beaches and nearshore environments.
   - **Momentum Balance**: They derived equations for the momentum balance in a fluid layer considering the effects of radiation stress. This helped in understanding how wave energy is transferred into the mean flow and how this energy drives currents.

4. **Analytical and Numerical Approaches**:
   - **Wave-Current Interaction**: The paper provided analytical solutions and insights into how waves interact with existing currents, demonstrating the effects of waves on the momentum and energy budgets in coastal waters.
   - **Influence on Coastal Processes**: Their work showed how the interaction between waves and currents could lead to significant changes in coastal processes, such as sediment transport, erosion, and the formation of coastal features like sandbars and rip channels.

### Mathematical Formulation

1. **Radiation Stress Tensor**:
   - **Components**: The radiation stress tensor \( S_{ij} \) has components that describe the flux of momentum due to the waves. For a wave field propagating primarily in the \( x \)-direction, the components are:
     $$
     S_{xx} = \left(E + \frac{1}{2} \rho g H^2\right) \cos^2 \theta + \frac{1}{2} \rho g H^2
     $$
     $$
     S_{yy} = \left(E + \frac{1}{2} \rho g H^2\right) \sin^2 \theta + \frac{1}{2} \rho g H^2
     $$
     $$
     S_{xy} = \left(E + \frac{1}{2} \rho g H^2\right) \sin\theta \cos\theta
     $$
     where:
     - \( E \) is the wave energy density,
     - \( H \) is the wave height,
     - \( \rho \) is the fluid density,
     - \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity,
     - \( \theta \) is the wave propagation angle relative to the \( x \)-axis.
   - **Interpretation**: These equations describe how the wave-induced momentum flux varies with the direction of wave propagation and the wave amplitude.

2. **Wave Setup and Setdown**:
   - **Wave Setup Equation**: The increase in mean water level due to wave setup is derived from the balance between the pressure gradient and the radiation stress gradient. In one dimension:
     $$
     \frac{\partial \zeta}{\partial x} = -\frac{1}{\rho g} \frac{\partial S_{xx}}{\partial x}
     $$
     where \( \zeta(x) \) represents the setup as a function of distance \( x \) from the shore.
   - **Wave Setdown**: In deeper water, where waves might not break, the decrease in radiation stress can cause a wave setdown, where the mean water level lowers before waves reach the breaking point.

3. **Wave-Driven Currents**:
   - **Longshore Currents**: Longuet-Higgins and Stewart showed that gradients in radiation stress along the shore lead to the generation of longshore currents, which flow parallel to the coastline. These currents are driven by the oblique incidence of waves, causing a net transfer of momentum along the shore.
   - **Rip Currents**: The interaction of wave-driven flows can also lead to the formation of rip currents, narrow, fast-flowing channels of water moving away from the shore. These are driven by variations in wave energy and radiation stress along the coast.

### Applications and Impact

1. **Coastal Engineering**:
   - **Design of Coastal Structures**: The insights provided by Longuet-Higgins and Stewart are fundamental in designing coastal structures, such as groynes, breakwaters, and seawalls. These structures must account for wave-induced forces, including radiation stress, to ensure stability and effectiveness.
   - **Beach Nourishment**: Their work also informs beach nourishment projects, where understanding wave setup and the distribution of wave-driven currents is crucial for predicting the movement and deposition of sand along the coast.

2. **Environmental Management**:
   - **Coastal Erosion**: By understanding the role of radiation stress in driving coastal processes, engineers and scientists can better predict and mitigate coastal erosion, especially in areas vulnerable to storm surges and high wave energy.
   - **Flood Risk Assessment**: The concept of wave setup is important in flood risk assessments, particularly in low-lying coastal regions where even small increases in water level can lead to significant flooding during storms.

3. **Oceanographic Research**:
   - **Wave-Current Interactions**: The paper has become a cornerstone in the study of [[wave-current interactions]], providing the basis for understanding how waves influence large-scale ocean currents and coastal circulation patterns.
   - **Numerical Modeling**: The concepts introduced by Longuet-Higgins and Stewart are now integral to numerical models that simulate coastal processes. Models like SWAN and ROMS incorporate radiation stress to predict wave-driven flows and their impacts on coastal environments.

### Conclusion

The 1962 paper by Longuet-Higgins and Stewart represents a major advancement in the understanding of wave-driven coastal processes. By introducing the concept of radiation stress and elucidating its role in wave setup, setdown, and the generation of currents, they provided a theoretical foundation that remains essential in coastal engineering, [[oceanography]], and environmental management. Their work continues to influence the design of coastal structures, the prediction of coastal erosion, and the development of models to simulate the complex interactions between waves and currents in the nearshore environment.
