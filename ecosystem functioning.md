Ecosystem Functioning


**ASSISTANT**

**Ecosystem Functioning** refers to the sum of biological, geochemical, and physical processes and components that take place or occur within an ecosystem. It encompasses a wide range of processes, such as primary production, [[nutrient cycling]], decomposition, and energy flow, which together maintain the structure and services provided by the ecosystem.

### Key Components

1. **Primary Production**: The process by which autotrophs (e.g., plants, algae) convert solar energy into chemical energy through photosynthesis, forming the basis of the food web.
   - **Gross Primary Productivity (GPP)**: The total amount of energy captured by autotrophs.
   - **Net Primary Productivity (NPP)**: The amount of energy remaining after autotrophs meet their metabolic needs (NPP = GPP - \(R_a\), where \(R_a\) is autotrophic respiration).

2. **Secondary Production**: The generation of biomass by heterotrophic organisms (e.g., animals, fungi) as they consume organic material and convert it into their own tissue.

3. **Nutrient Cycling**: The movement and exchange of organic and inorganic matter back into the production of living matter. Key cycles include the carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycles.
   - **Decomposition**: The breakdown of dead organic
