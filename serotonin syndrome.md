**USER**

serotonin syndrome


**ASSISTANT**

**Serotonin syndrome** is a potentially life-threatening condition that results from an excess of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, or 5-HT) in the central nervous system. It is usually triggered by the use of serotonergic drugs, particularly when multiple such drugs are taken together, leading to overstimulation of the [[serotonin receptors|5-HT receptors]].

### Pathophysiology

Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that plays a key role in regulating mood, cognition, thermoregulation, and several other physiological processes. The syndrome occurs when there is an excessive activation of serotonin receptors, particularly **5-HT1A** and **5-HT2A** receptors. The excess serotonin can disrupt normal neurotransmission and lead to dysfunction in autonomic, neuromuscular, and cognitive processes.

### Etiology (Causes)

Serotonin syndrome is most commonly induced by:
- **Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)**, such as fluoxetine or sertraline.
- **Serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)**, such as venlafaxine.
- **Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)**, which prevent the breakdown of serotonin.
- **Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)**, such as amitriptyline, which also increase serotonin levels.
- **5-HT1 receptor agonists**, such as sumatriptan.
- **Serotonin precursors** like tryptophan or supplements that increase serotonin synthesis.
- **Illicit drugs**, like MDMA (ecstasy), cocaine, or amphetamines.

Concomitant use of multiple serotonergic agents, particularly MAOIs with SSRIs, or interactions between certain over-the-counter medications and antidepressants, can precipitate the condition.

### Clinical Features

The clinical presentation of serotonin syndrome is characterized by a triad of symptoms:
1. **Autonomic instability**:
   - Hyperthermia
   - Hypertension or hypotension
   - Tachycardia
   - Diaphoresis (excessive sweating)
   - Pupillary dilation (mydriasis)
   - Flushing

2. **Neuromuscular hyperactivity**:
   - Hyperreflexia (exaggerated reflexes)
   - Tremor
   - Clonus (involuntary muscle contractions)
   - Rigidity
   - Myoclonus (muscle jerks)

3. **Altered mental status**:
   - Agitation
   - Confusion
   - Delirium
   - Hallucinations
   - Coma (in severe cases)

Symptoms generally develop within hours of drug administration or an increase in dosage and can range from mild to severe. Severe cases may involve **life-threatening hyperthermia** (temperatures above 41°C or 106°F), leading to complications such as metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, and multi-organ failure.

### Differential Diagnosis

Serotonin syndrome can be mistaken for other conditions with overlapping symptoms, such as:
- **Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS)**, which is associated with antipsychotic use but evolves more slowly and involves rigidity and elevated creatine kinase levels.
- **Malignant hyperthermia**, typically triggered by anesthetic agents.
- **Anticholinergic toxicity**, which presents with delirium, hyperthermia, and dry skin but lacks hyperreflexia and clonus.

### Diagnosis

There is no specific laboratory test for serotonin syndrome, so diagnosis is clinical and based on the **Hunter Serotonin Toxicity Criteria**, which requires the presence of at least one of the following:
- Spontaneous clonus
- Inducible clonus and agitation or diaphoresis
- Ocular clonus and agitation or diaphoresis
- Tremor and hyperreflexia
- Hypertonia and a temperature above 38°C with ocular or inducible clonus

These criteria help distinguish serotonin syndrome from other similar conditions.

### Treatment

The treatment of serotonin syndrome focuses on:
1. **Discontinuation of the offending agent(s)**: Immediate cessation of serotonergic drugs is the first and most critical step.
2. **Supportive care**: This includes intravenous fluids, oxygen, and monitoring of vital signs. Cooling measures may be required in cases of hyperthermia.
3. **Sedation with benzodiazepines**: This is used to control agitation and muscle rigidity.
4. **Serotonin antagonists**: Drugs like **cyproheptadine**, a non-selective serotonin receptor antagonist, can be administered in moderate to severe cases to mitigate symptoms.
5. **Management of complications**: If severe hyperthermia or seizures occur, more intensive interventions like neuromuscular paralysis or intubation may be needed.

### Prevention

- **Medication review and caution**: Preventing serotonin syndrome involves careful prescription practices, avoiding combinations of serotonergic drugs without medical supervision, and providing patient education about potential drug interactions.
- **Drug interaction monitoring**: Use of resources like drug interaction checkers can reduce the risk, particularly when prescribing MAOIs or switching between different classes of antidepressants.

### Prognosis

When recognized early and treated appropriately, serotonin syndrome generally has a favorable prognosis, with most patients recovering fully within 24 hours after discontinuation of the offending agent. However, severe cases that go untreated can lead to lasting neurological damage or death.

In conclusion, serotonin syndrome is a potentially fatal condition that requires rapid recognition and intervention. Its hallmark features—autonomic instability, neuromuscular excitation, and altered mental status—can often be traced back to the misuse or interaction of serotonergic drugs.
