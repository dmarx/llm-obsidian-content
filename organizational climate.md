### Organizational Climate

**Organizational climate** refers to the shared perceptions and attitudes about the organization’s policies, practices, and procedures. It is a collective view of the organizational environment that influences employees' behavior, motivation, and overall performance. Unlike organizational culture, which deals with underlying values and beliefs, organizational climate is more about the tangible aspects of the work environment and how these are perceived by employees.

   - **Conflict Management**: How conflicts are resolved and whether there is a culture of mutual respect.

#### Measuring Organizational Climate
