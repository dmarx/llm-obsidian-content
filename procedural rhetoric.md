### Procedural Rhetoric

**Procedural rhetoric** is a concept coined by [[Ian Bogost]], a prominent figure in game studies. It refers to the practice of using the rules and mechanics of games to convey ideas, arguments, or perspectives. Unlike traditional rhetoric, which relies on verbal or written communication, procedural rhetoric leverages the processes, interactions, and systems within a game to make a statement or persuade the player.

#### Key Concepts of Procedural Rhetoric

1. **Procedures as Arguments**: In procedural rhetoric, the rules and mechanics of a game are seen as the primary means of making arguments. These procedures dictate how the game world operates, guiding players through a series of actions that implicitly or explicitly communicate a message.

2. **Player Agency**: Procedural rhetoric emphasizes the active role of the player. By engaging with the game’s mechanics, players explore and internalize the underlying arguments through their interactions. This contrasts with passive consumption of traditional media.

3. **Modeling Systems**: Games can model real-world systems and processes, allowing players to experiment with different variables and see the outcomes. This modeling can be used to illustrate complex systems like economic policies, social behaviors, or environmental issues.

4. **Persuasion through Interaction**: The persuasive power of procedural rhetoric lies in the interactive nature of games. Players are not merely told about a concept; they experience and experiment with it firsthand, leading to a deeper understanding and potentially altering their perspectives.

#### Examples of Procedural Rhetoric

1. **"Papers, Please"**: This game places players in the role of an immigration officer in a dystopian setting. Through its mechanics, it explores themes of bureaucracy, power, and moral dilemmas. The procedures of checking documents and making decisions under pressure convey the complexities and ethical challenges of border control.

2. **"SimCity"**: By simulating urban planning, "SimCity" allows players to experiment with different policies and witness their effects on a virtual city. The game’s mechanics illustrate the interconnectedness of economic, social, and environmental factors in urban development.

3. **"McDonald's Videogame"**: This satirical game critiques the practices of the fast-food industry. Players manage the entire supply chain of a McDonald's franchise, dealing with issues like deforestation, animal welfare, and marketing. The game’s procedures highlight the ethical and environmental consequences of the industry’s practices.

#### Mathematical Formalization in Procedural Rhetoric

Mathematical models play a crucial role in procedural rhetoric by providing formal structures for [[game mechanics]] and interactions. Here are some ways mathematical formalization is applied:

1. **Finite State Machines (FSMs)**: Used to represent the different states and transitions within a game. Each state represents a condition or situation, and transitions are triggered by player actions or in-game events.

$$
\delta: S \times I \rightarrow S
$$

where \( S \) is the set of states, \( I \) is the set of inputs, and \( \delta \) is the transition function.

2. **Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)**: Employed to model decision-making in games with probabilistic outcomes. An MDP is defined by a set of states \( S \), a set of actions \( A \), a transition function \( P: S \times A \times S \rightarrow [0,1] \), and a reward function \( R: S \times A \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \).

$$
P(s' \mid s, a) = \Pr(S_{t+1} = s' \mid S_t = s, A_t = a)
$$

3. **Game Theory**: Analyzes strategic interactions in games where the outcome depends on the choices of multiple players. Payoff matrices are used to represent the rewards associated with different strategies.

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1n} \\
a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{2n} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \cdots & a_{mn} \\
\end{pmatrix}
$$

where \( a_{ij} \) denotes the payoff for the \( i \)-th strategy of player 1 and the \( j \)-th strategy of player 2.

#### Application of Procedural Rhetoric

1. **Educational Games**: Games designed to teach specific concepts or skills can use procedural rhetoric to reinforce learning. For example, a game about environmental conservation might use its mechanics to show the impact of different conservation strategies on ecosystems.

2. **Political and Social Commentary**: Games can address political and social issues by embedding arguments within their mechanics. This allows players to explore and understand different viewpoints through gameplay.

3. **Training Simulations**: Simulations for professional training, such as medical or military training, use procedural rhetoric to immerse trainees in realistic scenarios, helping them understand and respond to complex situations.

#### Conclusion

Procedural rhetoric is a powerful tool in game design, enabling creators to embed meaningful arguments and messages within the mechanics of their games. By engaging with these procedures, players can gain a deeper understanding of complex systems and issues, making procedural rhetoric an effective method for education, persuasion, and commentary.
