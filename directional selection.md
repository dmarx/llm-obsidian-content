### Directional Selection

**Directional selection** is a form of natural selection that favors one extreme phenotype over the mean or other extremes. This type of selection causes a shift in the population's phenotypic distribution toward the favored extreme. Directional selection is a primary driver of evolutionary change, as it can significantly alter trait distributions over time.

#### Mechanisms of Directional Selection

1. **Selective Pressure**: In directional selection, environmental changes or other selective pressures favor individuals at one end of the trait spectrum. This could be due to factors like climate change, predation, or resource availability.

   $$ W(x) = e^{s(x - \mu)} $$

   where \( W(x) \) is the fitness of an individual with trait value \( x \), \( \mu \) is the mean trait value, and \( s \) is the selection coefficient.

2. **Fitness Gradient**: The fitness gradient in directional selection is linear, meaning fitness increases or decreases consistently with the trait value.

3. **Shift in Mean Trait Value**: Over generations, the mean trait value shifts in the direction of the favored extreme. This results in a change in the overall trait distribution within the population.

#### Mathematical Modeling of Directional Selection

Directional selection can be modeled using the breeder's equation and concepts from quantitative genetics.

1. **Breeder's Equation**:

   $$ R = h^2 S $$

   where:
   - \( R \) is the response to selection (change in the mean trait value in the next generation).
   - \( h^2 \) is the heritability of the trait (proportion of phenotypic variance due to genetic variance).
   - \( S \) is the selection differential (difference between the mean trait value of selected parents and the mean trait value of the original population).

2. **Selection Differential**:

   $$ S = \bar{z_s} - \bar{z} $$

   where \( \bar{z_s} \) is the mean trait value of the selected parents, and \( \bar{z} \) is the mean trait value of the original population.

#### Examples of Directional Selection

1. **Peppered Moths (Biston betularia)**: During the Industrial Revolution in England, the frequency of dark-colored (melanic) peppered moths increased due to soot-covered trees. The dark-colored moths had a survival advantage in polluted environments as they were better camouflaged from predators.

   $$ \text{Mean Color} \rightarrow \text{Darker} $$

2. **Antibiotic Resistance in Bacteria**: In populations of bacteria exposed to antibiotics, resistant individuals have a survival advantage. Over time, the frequency of antibiotic-resistant bacteria increases, shifting the population toward resistance.

   $$ \text{Resistance Level} \rightarrow \text{Higher} $$

3. **Body Size in Animals**: If larger body size provides a fitness advantage (e.g., in predation or mating success), over generations, the average body size of the population will increase.

   $$ \text{Mean Body Size} \rightarrow \text{Larger} $$

#### Implications of Directional Selection

1. **Evolutionary Change**: Directional selection is a major mechanism driving evolutionary change. By consistently favoring one extreme, it can lead to significant adaptations over relatively short periods.

2. **Adaptation**: Populations under directional selection can rapidly adapt to new environments or changing conditions, enhancing their survival and reproductive success.

3. **Genetic Variation**: While directional selection can reduce genetic variation by favoring certain alleles, it can also increase variation if the selective pressure changes direction or if the favored trait is influenced by multiple genes.

4. **Speciation**: Over long periods, directional selection can contribute to speciation, particularly if different populations experience different selective pressures, leading to divergence in traits and reproductive isolation.

#### Modeling Example

Suppose a population of birds has a mean beak size of 10 mm. Birds with larger beaks (e.g., 12 mm) have a survival advantage because they can crack open larger seeds. The heritability of beak size is 0.5, and the selected birds have a mean beak size of 12 mm.

- **Selection Differential ($S$)**:
  $$ S = 12 - 10 = 2 \text{ mm} $$

- **Heritability ($h^2$)**:
  $$ h^2 = 0.5 $$

- **Response to Selection ($R$)**:
  $$ R = h^2 S = 0.5 \times 2 = 1 \text{ mm} $$

Thus, the expected increase in the mean beak size in the next generation is 1 mm, resulting in a new mean beak size of 11 mm.

### Summary

Directional selection is a powerful evolutionary force that shifts the mean phenotype of a population towards one extreme. It plays a critical role in adaptation and evolutionary change, helping populations respond to environmental pressures and new challenges. By understanding directional selection, scientists can better predict how species will evolve over time in response to natural and artificial selective pressures.
