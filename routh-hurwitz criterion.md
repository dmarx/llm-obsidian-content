### Routh-Hurwitz Criterion

The Routh-Hurwitz Criterion is a mathematical technique used in control theory to determine the stability of a linear time-invariant (LTI) system. It provides a systematic method for checking whether all the roots of the characteristic polynomial of the system have negative real parts, which is a necessary and sufficient condition for the system to be stable.

#### 1. **Characteristic Polynomial**

The stability of an LTI system can be analyzed by examining its characteristic polynomial. For a system described by the differential equation:

$$
a_n s^n + a_{n-1} s^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 s + a_0 = 0,
$$

where \( a_i \) are the coefficients, the polynomial \( P(s) \) is given by:

$$
P(s) = a_n s^n + a_{n-1} s^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 s + a_0.
$$

#### 2. **Routh Array Construction**

The Routh-Hurwitz Criterion involves constructing the Routh array from the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial. The steps are as follows:

1. **First Row**: List the coefficients of the polynomial, starting with the highest degree term, alternating between coefficients:
   \[
   R_1 = [a_n, a_{n-2}, a_{n-4}, \ldots]
   \]

2. **Second Row**: List the remaining coefficients:
   \[
   R_2 = [a_{n-1}, a_{n-3}, a_{n-5}, \ldots]
   \]

3. **Subsequent Rows**: Each element in the rows below is calculated using the determinant of a 2x2 matrix formed from elements above. Specifically, for the $i$-th row and $j$-th column:
   \[
   R_{i,j} = \frac{R_{i-1,1} \cdot R_{i-2,j+1} - R_{i-2,1} \cdot R_{i-1,j+1}}{R_{i-1,1}}
   \]

The array continues until a row of zeros is encountered or all coefficients are determined.

#### 3. **Stability Criterion**

To determine the stability of the system:

- Count the number of sign changes in the first column of the Routh array.
- The number of sign changes indicates the number of roots with positive real parts (unstable poles).
- For the system to be stable, there should be no sign changes in the first column of the Routh array, implying all roots have negative real parts.

#### 4. **Example**

Consider a characteristic polynomial:

$$
P(s) = s^4 + 3s^3 + 3s^2 + 2s + 1.
$$

Construct the Routh array:

\[
\begin{array}{c|cccc}
s^4 & 1 & 3 & 1 & 0 \\
s^3 & 3 & 2 & 0 & 0 \\
s^2 & \frac{3 \cdot 2 - 3 \cdot 1}{3} & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
s^1 & \frac{3 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot 0}{1} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
s^0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\end{array}
\]

Simplifying the entries:

\[
\begin{array}{c|cccc}
s^4 & 1 & 3 & 1 & 0 \\
s^3 & 3 & 2 & 0 & 0 \\
s^2 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
s^1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
s^0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\end{array}
\]

The first column is:

\[
\begin{array}{c}
1 \\
3 \\
1 \\
1 \\
1 \\
\end{array}
\]

Since there are no sign changes in the first column, all roots of the polynomial have negative real parts, indicating that the system is stable.

#### 5. **Special Cases**

##### Zero in the First Column

If a zero appears in the first column but the row is not entirely zero, replace the zero with a small positive number \(\epsilon\) and proceed. After forming the Routh array, take the limit as \(\epsilon \to 0\).

##### Entire Row of Zeros

If an entire row becomes zero, it indicates the presence of symmetrical roots about the origin (purely imaginary roots or pairs of complex conjugates on the imaginary axis). The auxiliary polynomial is formed using the coefficients of the row above the all-zero row, and its derivative is used to replace the zero row.

For example, if a row becomes zero when constructing the array for \( P(s) \):

$$
Q(s) = b_m s^m + b_{m-2} s^{m-2} + \cdots
$$

Replace the all-zero row with the coefficients of \( Q'(s) \) (the derivative of the auxiliary polynomial).

### Conclusion

The Routh-Hurwitz Criterion provides a straightforward yet powerful method for determining the stability of LTI systems by analyzing the characteristic polynomial. It is especially useful for systems with higher-order polynomials, allowing engineers to assess stability without explicitly solving for the roots. Understanding and applying the Routh-Hurwitz Criterion is crucial for ensuring the reliable performance of control systems across various applications.
