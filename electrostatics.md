### Electrostatics

Electrostatics is the branch of physics that studies electric charges at rest. It encompasses the study of electric fields, electric potentials, and the forces between static charges. The fundamental principles of electrostatics are described by Coulomb's law, Gauss's law, and the concept of electric potential.

#### Fundamental Principles

1. **Coulomb's Law:**
   - Coulomb's law quantifies the force between two point charges. The force \( \mathbf{F} \) between two charges \( q_1 \) and \( q_2 \) separated by a distance \( r \) in a vacuum is given by:
     $$
     \mathbf{F} = k_e \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2} \hat{\mathbf{r}}
     $$
     where \( k_e \) is Coulomb's constant (\( k_e \approx 8.9875 \times 10^9 \, \text{N m}^2 \text{C}^{-2} \)), and \( \hat{\mathbf{r}} \) is the unit vector from \( q_1 \) to \( q_2 \).

2. **Electric Field:**
   - The electric field \( \mathbf{E} \) at a point in space is defined as the force \( \mathbf{F} \) per unit charge \( q \) experienced by a small positive test charge placed at that point:
     $$
     \mathbf{E} = \frac{\mathbf{F}}{q}
     $$
   - For a point charge \( q \), the electric field at a distance \( r \) from the charge is:
     $$
     \mathbf{E} = k_e \frac{q}{r^2} \hat{\mathbf{r}}
     $$

3. **Gauss's Law:**
   - Gauss's law relates the electric flux through a closed surface to the charge enclosed by that surface. Mathematically, it is expressed as:
     $$
     \oint_{\partial V} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{A} = \frac{Q_{\text{enc}}}{\epsilon_0}
     $$
     where \( \oint_{\partial V} \) denotes a surface integral over the closed surface \( \partial V \), \( d\mathbf{A} \) is the differential area vector on the surface, \( Q_{\text{enc}} \) is the total charge enclosed, and \( \epsilon_0 \) is the [[permittivity]] of free space (\( \epsilon_0 \approx 8.854 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{F/m} \)).

4. **Electric Potential:**
   - The electric potential \( V \) at a point is the work done per unit charge to move a small positive test charge from infinity to that point in the presence of an electric field:
     $$
     V = - \int_{\infty}^{r} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{l}
     $$
   - For a point charge \( q \), the electric potential at a distance \( r \) is:
     $$
     V = k_e \frac{q}{r}
     $$

#### Applications and Examples

1. **Capacitors:**
   - Capacitors are devices that store electric energy by separating charges on two conductive plates. The capacitance \( C \) of a parallel plate capacitor with area \( A \) and plate separation \( d \) is:
     $$
     C = \epsilon_0 \frac{A}{d}
     $$
   - The energy \( U \) stored in a capacitor with charge \( Q \) and potential difference \( V \) is:
     $$
     U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 = \frac{Q^2}{2C}
     $$

2. **Electrostatic Shielding:**
   - Conductive materials can be used to shield regions from external electric fields. This principle is applied in Faraday cages, which are enclosures made of conducting material that block external electric fields.

3. **Electric Dipoles:**
   - An electric dipole consists of two equal and opposite charges \( \pm q \) separated by a distance \( d \). The dipole moment \( \mathbf{p} \) is defined as:
     $$
     \mathbf{p} = q \mathbf{d}
     $$
   - The electric potential \( V \) and field \( \mathbf{E} \) at a point due to a dipole are more complex and depend on the orientation of the dipole relative to the point.

#### Mathematical Solutions

1. **Poisson's Equation:**
   - For a region with a charge density \( \rho \), the electric potential \( V \) satisfies Poisson's equation:
     $$
     \nabla^2 V = -\frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}
     $$

2. **Laplace's Equation:**
   - In charge-free regions, Poisson's equation reduces to Laplace's equation:
     $$
     \nabla^2 V = 0
     $$

3. **Boundary Conditions:**
   - Solutions to electrostatic problems often involve solving Poisson's or Laplace's equations with appropriate boundary conditions, such as specifying the potential on a conducting surface or the charge distribution.

#### Advanced Topics

1. **Multipole Expansion:**
   - For complex charge distributions, the electric potential at a large distance can be approximated using a multipole expansion, which expresses the potential as a sum of contributions from monopole, dipole, quadrupole, and higher-order moments.

2. **Dielectrics:**
   - Dielectric materials influence electric fields by polarizing in response to an applied electric field, reducing the effective field within the material. The relationship between the displacement field \( \mathbf{D} \), electric field \( \mathbf{E} \), and polarization \( \mathbf{P} \) is:
     $$
     \mathbf{D} = \epsilon_0 \mathbf{E} + \mathbf{P}
     $$
   - In linear dielectrics, \( \mathbf{P} = \chi_e \epsilon_0 \mathbf{E} \), where \( \chi_e \) is the [[electric susceptibility]], and \( \mathbf{D} = \epsilon \mathbf{E} \), where \( \epsilon = \epsilon_0 (1 + \chi_e) \) is the [[permittivity]] of the dielectric.

### Summary

Electrostatics is the study of electric charges at rest and encompasses the concepts of electric fields, potentials, and forces between charges. Key principles include Coulomb's law, Gauss's law, and the notion of electric potential. Electrostatics has numerous applications, including capacitors, electrostatic shielding, and electric dipoles. The mathematical framework involves solving Poisson's and Laplace's equations, often with boundary conditions, to determine electric fields and potentials in various configurations. Advanced topics include multipole expansions and the behavior of dielectrics in electric fields. Understanding electrostatics is essential for many areas of physics and engineering, from designing electronic components to understanding fundamental interactions in nature.
