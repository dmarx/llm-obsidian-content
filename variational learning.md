**USER**

variational learning


**ASSISTANT**

The user is asking me to create a wiki-style entry for "variational learning" for a technical reference in Obsidian vault format. This is for an AI researcher, ML scientist, applied mathematician, and philosopher of mind. 

Key requirements:
1. Technical, deeply detailed explanations with mathematical formalisms
2. Use double brackets for novel phrases [[like this]]
3. User has graduate degrees in applied math, stats, philosophy of science
4. User is fluent in advanced math but not physics conventions - need to explain physics notation
5. Propose symbolic notation for modeling
6. Don't respond conversationally - just wiki content
7. Don't acknowledge the interaction

The topic is "variational learning" which is a broad concept in machine learning that encompasses:
- Variational inference
- Variational autoencoders (VAEs)
- Variational Bayesian methods
- Variational principles in general

I should structure this as a comprehensive wiki page covering the mathematical foundations, key concepts, and applications. I'll need to be very technical and include concrete mathematical formulations.

Let me structure this as:
1. Definition and foundational concepts
2. Mathematical framework
3. Key applications/instantiations
4. Connections to other concepts
5. Symbolic notation proposals

I should use wiki-style links extensively for related concepts.# Variational Learning

[[Variational learning]] encompasses a family of machine learning techniques that leverage [[variational principles]] to approximate intractable probability distributions and optimize complex objective functions. The fundamental approach transforms difficult inference and learning problems into optimization problems over families of tractable distributions.

## Mathematical Foundation

The core mathematical principle underlying variational learning is the [[variational approximation]] of probability distributions. Given an intractable target distribution $p(z|x)$, we seek to find the best approximation $q_\phi(z)$ within a tractable family $\mathcal{Q}$ parameterized by $\phi$.

### Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO)

The [[Evidence Lower Bound]] provides the fundamental objective function for most variational learning algorithms. For a probabilistic model with observed data $x$ and latent variables $z$:

$$\log p(x) = \mathbb{E}_{q_\phi(z)}\left[\log \frac{p(x,z)}{q_\phi(z)}\right] + \text{KL}(q_\phi(z) \| p(z|x))$$

Since the [[Kullback-Leibler divergence]] $\text{KL}(q_\phi(z) \| p(z|x)) \geq 0$, we obtain:

$$\log p(x) \geq \mathcal{L}(\phi) = \mathbb{E}_{q_\phi(z)}\left[\log p(x,z) - \log q_\phi(z)\right]$$

The ELBO $\mathcal{L}(\phi)$ can be decomposed as:

$$\mathcal{L}(\phi) = \mathbb{E}_{q_\phi(z)}[\log p(x|z)] - \text{KL}(q_\phi(z) \| p(z))$$

This decomposition reveals two competing objectives: maximizing the [[reconstruction likelihood]] while minimizing the divergence from the prior.

### Variational Inference Framework

Let $\Theta = (\theta, \phi)$ denote the complete parameter set, where $\theta$ parameterizes the generative model and $\phi$ parameterizes the [[variational posterior]]. The [[joint optimization problem]] becomes:

$$\max_{\theta,\phi} \mathcal{L}(\theta, \phi) = \max_{\theta,\phi} \mathbb{E}_{q_\phi(z|x)}[\log p_\theta(x,z) - \log q_\phi(z|x)]$$

### Gradient Estimation

A critical challenge in variational learning is computing gradients with respect to the variational parameters $\phi$. The [[reparameterization trick]] enables low-variance gradient estimation:

For distributions admitting a reparameterization $z = g_\phi(\epsilon, x)$ where $\epsilon \sim p(\epsilon)$:

$$\nabla_\phi \mathbb{E}_{q_\phi(z|x)}[f(z)] = \mathbb{E}_{p(\epsilon)}[\nabla_\phi f(g_\phi(\epsilon, x))]$$

When reparameterization is not available, the [[REINFORCE estimator]] provides an alternative:

$$\nabla_\phi \mathbb{E}_{q_\phi(z)}[f(z)] = \mathbb{E}_{q_\phi(z)}[f(z) \nabla_\phi \log q_\phi(z)]$$

## Key Instantiations

### Variational Autoencoders

[[Variational Autoencoders]] (VAEs) represent the most prominent application of variational learning to [[generative modeling]]. The architecture consists of:

- **Encoder**: $q_\phi(z|x)$ - the [[recognition network]]
- **Decoder**: $p_\theta(x|z)$ - the [[generative network]]

The VAE objective combines reconstruction and regularization:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{VAE}}(\theta,\phi) = \mathbb{E}_{q_\phi(z|x)}[\log p_\theta(x|z)] - \beta \cdot \text{KL}(q_\phi(z|x) \| p(z))$$

where $\beta$ controls the [[regularization strength]].

### Variational Bayesian Neural Networks

[[Variational Bayesian Neural Networks]] apply variational principles to obtain [[uncertainty quantification]] in neural networks. Instead of point estimates for weights $w$, we maintain distributions $q_\phi(w)$:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{VBNN}} = \mathbb{E}_{q_\phi(w)}[\log p(y|x,w)] - \text{KL}(q_\phi(w) \| p(w))$$

### Normalizing Flows

[[Normalizing flows]] enhance variational learning by constructing more expressive variational families. A normalizing flow $f_\phi$ transforms a simple base distribution $z_0$ through a sequence of [[invertible transformations]]:

$$z_K = f_\phi^{(K)} \circ \cdots \circ f_\phi^{(1)}(z_0)$$

The resulting density follows the [[change of variables formula]]:

$$\log q_\phi(z_K) = \log p(z_0) - \sum_{k=1}^K \log \left|\det \frac{\partial f_\phi^{(k)}}{\partial z_{k-1}}\right|$$

## Symbolic Notation Framework

Let us establish a comprehensive symbolic framework for variational learning:

**Distribution Spaces:**
- $\mathcal{P}$: Space of all probability distributions
- $\mathcal{Q}_\phi \subset \mathcal{P}$: Parameterized variational family
- $\mathcal{M}_\theta$: Generative model family

**Divergence Measures:**
- $D_{\text{KL}}(q \| p)$: Forward KL divergence
- $D_{\text{KL}}(p \| q)$: Reverse KL divergence  
- $D_{\alpha}(q \| p)$: [[Alpha-divergence]]

**Optimization Operators:**
- $\Pi_{\mathcal{Q}}[p] = \arg\min_{q \in \mathcal{Q}} D(q \| p)$: [[Variational projection]]
- $\nabla_\phi^{\text{grad}}$: [[Gradient operator]] with variance reduction
- $\nabla_\phi^{\text{score}}$: [[Score function gradient]]

**Information-Theoretic Quantities:**
- $I_q(x;z) = \mathbb{E}_{q(x,z)}[\log \frac{q(x,z)}{q(x)q(z)}]$: [[Mutual information]]
- $H_q(z|x) = -\mathbb{E}_{q(z|x)}[\log q(z|x)]$: [[Conditional entropy]]

## Theoretical Connections

### Information Theory

Variational learning establishes deep connections with [[information theory]]. The ELBO can be rewritten in information-theoretic terms:

$$\mathcal{L} = I_q(x;z) + H_q(x) - \text{KL}(q(z) \| p(z))$$

This reveals variational learning as maximizing [[mutual information]] between observations and latents while regularizing the marginal latent distribution.

### Statistical Physics

The connection to [[statistical physics]] emerges through the [[free energy principle]]. The ELBO corresponds to the negative [[variational free energy]]:

$$F = \mathbb{E}_{q(z)}[E(x,z)] + T \cdot S(q)$$

where $E(x,z) = -\log p(x,z)$ is the energy function, $S(q) = -\mathbb{E}_{q(z)}[\log q(z)]$ is the entropy, and $T$ represents the temperature parameter.

### Optimal Transport

Recent developments connect variational learning with [[optimal transport theory]]. The [[Wasserstein distance]] provides an alternative to KL divergence:

$$W_2(q,p)^2 = \inf_{\gamma \in \Pi(q,p)} \mathbb{E}_{(z,z') \sim \gamma}[\|z - z'\|^2]$$

This leads to [[Wasserstein autoencoders]] and other transport-based variational methods.

## Computational Considerations

### Scalability

For large-scale applications, [[amortized inference]] is crucial. Rather than optimizing variational parameters for each data point, we learn a mapping $x \mapsto \phi(x)$ through the recognition network.

### Posterior Collapse

A persistent challenge in variational learning is [[posterior collapse]], where $q_\phi(z|x) \approx p(z)$. This phenomenon occurs when the KL regularization overwhelms the reconstruction term, leading to uninformative latent representations.

### Higher-Order Methods

Advanced optimization techniques for variational learning include:
- [[Natural gradients]] using the [[Fisher information matrix]]
- [[Quasi-Newton methods]] adapted for stochastic objectives
- [[Mirror descent]] algorithms for constrained parameter spaces

The framework of variational learning continues to evolve, with ongoing research in [[hierarchical variational models]], [[meta-learning]] applications, and connections to [[causal inference]].
