abelian groups generalize addition: which group generalizes multiplication (inner  product)


**ASSISTANT**

The concept of a group generalizing multiplication in a manner analogous to how abelian groups generalize addition is best associated with the broader concept of **groups** themselves, rather than a specific subtype of groups tailored to multiplication. When discussing operations akin to multiplication, especially those that follow associative and invertible properties, we typically refer to the general structure of groups without necessarily implying commutativity (abelian property). However, certain types of groups and algebraic structures provide a more nuanced framework for understanding "multiplication-like" operations:

### Groups

In the general sense, a **group** $(G, \cdot)$, where $\cdot$ denotes the group operation, can be thought of as generalizing multiplication when the operation is not commutative. For example, matrix multiplication forms a group under certain conditions (specifically, the general linear group of invertible matrices, $GL_n(\mathbb{F})$, over a field $\mathbb{F}$), but it is not commutative, hence not an abelian group.

### Rings and Fields

To capture the essence of multiplication more formally, especially when considering structures that support both "addition" and "multiplication," **rings** and **fields** are more appropriate algebraic structures:

- **Ring**: A set equipped with two binary operations (often thought of as addition and multiplication) that generalize the arithmetic operations of integers. A ring has an abelian group structure under addition, but multiplication need not be commutative. In a **commutative ring**, the multiplication operation is commutative.

- **Field**: A more specialized form of a ring in which both operations behave nicelyâ€”addition forms an abelian group, and multiplication (ignoring the additive identity) also forms an abelian group. Thus, fields generalize both addition and multiplication where both operations are commutative and invertible (except for division by zero).

### Vector Spaces and Inner Product Spaces

While not groups per se in the context of multiplication, **vector spaces** and **inner product spaces** (a specialization of vector spaces) incorporate multiplication-like operations through scalar multiplication and the inner product, respectively:

- **Vector Space**: An algebraic structure consisting of vectors, where vector addition forms an abelian group, and scalar multiplication generalizes the idea of "multiplying" vectors by elements of a field.

- **Inner Product Space**: Enhances a vector space by introducing an inner product, a generalization of the dot product, which allows for measuring angles and lengths within the space. The inner product itself is not a group operation, but it is a multiplication-like operation that provides a rich geometric structure.

### Conclusion

While abelian groups directly generalize addition by emphasizing commutativity, the concept of groups, along with the structures of rings and fields, more closely aligns with the generalization of multiplication, particularly when considering the properties of associativity, identity, and invertibility. Inner product spaces, by introducing a multiplication-like operation that captures geometric and algebraic properties, further illustrate the broad applicability of multiplication concepts in abstract algebra and beyond.
