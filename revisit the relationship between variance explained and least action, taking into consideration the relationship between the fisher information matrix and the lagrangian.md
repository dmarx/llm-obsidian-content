revisit the [[relationship between variance explained and least action]], taking into consideration the relationship between the fisher information matrix and the lagrangian


**ASSISTANT**

Given the profound relationships between the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) and the Lagrangian as explored in the context of information geometry and statistical physics, revisiting the connection between variance explained in statistics and the principle of least action in physics, now through this lens, offers a richer and more complex perspective. This relationship can be approached by examining how each concept minimizes a certain quantity—variance and action, respectively—while also considering how informational principles potentially unify these concepts.

### Variance Explained and Its Informational Context

In statistics, variance explained—often quantified in methods like PCA or regression analysis—measures how much of the uncertainty (variance) in the data is accounted for by the model. In the language of information theory, reducing variance is akin to reducing entropy (uncertainty) about the data's structure given the model. The FIM provides a way to measure how sensitive a probability model is to changes in its parameters, thus quantifying the amount of information each parameter contributes about the observed data.

### Principle of Least Action Through Informational Principles

In physics, the principle of least action involves finding the path that minimizes the action integral, a quantity derived from the Lagrangian. When considering the FIM within a physical context, especially where parameters or states of a system evolve according to probabilistic laws (as in quantum mechanics or statistical mechanics), the action could be conceptually related to minimizing a form of informational entropy or divergence across the evolution of the system.

### Bridging the Concepts

1. **Informational Optimization**: Both variance explained and the principle of least action can be thought of as optimization problems. In statistics, models are optimized to maximize the variance explained; in physics, trajectories are optimized to minimize the action. When considering the FIM and Lagrangian, one might speculate about a unified framework where the "action" minimized in a statistical model is akin to a divergence or entropy measure, which is directly related to the information the parameters convey about the observed data.

2. **Geometric Interpretation**: The geometric interpretation offered by information geometry—where the FIM defines a metric on the parameter space—suggests a method to explore paths (or parameter evolutions) that are not only statistically optimal (in terms of information provided) but also physically minimal (in terms of an action-like quantity). This could potentially align the statistical paths that maximize variance explained with those that minimize an informational action.

3. **Variational Principles and Statistical Estimation**: Variational principles are central in both contexts. In physics, they determine the dynamics of systems via least action. In statistics, especially in a Bayesian framework, variational methods are used to approximate posterior distributions, essentially minimizing a form of KL-divergence (informational action) between the true posterior and the approximation.

4. **Unified Theoretical Constructs**: Theoretical constructs that involve both Fisher information and action (such as the path integral formulation in quantum mechanics or stochastic control theory in engineering) might provide a mathematical basis for relating these concepts. These constructs often involve an integral over exponentials of actions or entropies, hinting at a deeper connection between minimizing informational divergence and physical action.

### Conclusion

Through the lens of information theory and geometry, variance explained and the principle of least action may be viewed as different manifestations of a broader principle of informational economy—minimizing uncertainty or entropy along a trajectory, whether it be in parameter space or physical space. This approach not only enriches our understanding of each concept but also highlights the universal applicative nature of variational principles across disciplines.
