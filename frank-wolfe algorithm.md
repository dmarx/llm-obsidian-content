**Frank-Wolfe Algorithm**

### Definition
The Frank-Wolfe algorithm, also known as the **Convex Combination Algorithm**, is an iterative optimization technique used to solve convex optimization problems. It is particularly useful in transportation planning to solve the traffic assignment problem under the framework of Wardrop's First Principle.

### Problem Formulation
Consider the problem of minimizing a convex objective function $f(x)$ over a convex set $X$. In the context of traffic assignment, $f(x)$ represents the total travel cost, and $x$ denotes the flow on the network.

Mathematically, the problem is:

$$
\min_{x \in X} f(x)
$$

### Steps of the Frank-Wolfe Algorithm
1. **Initialization:**
   - Start with an initial feasible solution \( x^0 \in X \).

2. **Direction-Finding Step:**
   - At iteration \( k \), solve the linear approximation of $f$ at \( x^k \):

     $$
     s^k = \arg\min_{s \in X} \nabla f(x^k)^T (s - x^k)
     $$

   - Here, \( \nabla f(x^k) \) is the gradient of \( f \) at \( x^k \).

3. **Line Search:**
   - Determine the optimal step size \( \alpha_k \) by solving:

     $$
     \alpha_k = \arg\min_{\alpha \in [0,1]} f(x^k + \alpha (s^k - x^k))
     $$

4. **Update:**
   - Update the solution:

     $$
     x^{k+1} = x^k + \alpha_k (s^k - x^k)
     $$

5. **Convergence Check:**
   - Check if the algorithm has converged. If not, return to Step 2.

### Convergence
The Frank-Wolfe algorithm converges to an optimal solution under mild conditions due to the convexity of the objective function. The rate of convergence is sublinear, specifically $O(1/k)$, where $k$ is the iteration number.

### Application in Traffic Assignment
In the context of the traffic assignment problem, the objective function $f(x)$ is typically the total travel time on the network, which is convex. The feasible set $X$ represents all possible flow distributions that satisfy demand constraints.

#### Step-by-Step Example

1. **Initialization:**
   - Start with an initial feasible flow \( x^0 \) (e.g., all traffic assigned to the shortest path).

2. **Direction-Finding Step:**
   - Solve the linearized problem to find the shortest path based on the current marginal travel costs.

3. **Line Search:**
   - Perform a line search to find the optimal step size \( \alpha_k \) that minimizes the total travel cost along the direction found.

4. **Update:**
   - Update the flow using the step size and the direction found.

5. **Convergence Check:**
   - Check if the change in flow or travel cost is below a certain threshold. If not, repeat the steps.

### Pseudocode
Here is a pseudocode representation of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm for traffic assignment:

```markdown
Initialize x^0 to a feasible solution
k = 0

while not converged:
    Calculate current travel costs based on x^k
    Find shortest paths (direction-finding step) to get s^k
    Perform line search to determine optimal step size α_k
    Update flow: x^{k+1} = x^k + α_k (s^k - x^k)
    k = k + 1

return x^k
```

### Advantages and Disadvantages
#### Advantages:
- **Simplicity:** The algorithm is conceptually straightforward and easy to implement.
- **Iterative Nature:** It can handle large-scale problems by iteratively improving the solution.
- **Flexibility:** It works well for a wide range of convex optimization problems.

#### Disadvantages:
- **Slow Convergence:** The sublinear rate of convergence can be slow for large-scale problems.
- **Dependent on Initialization:** The quality of the initial solution can affect the number of iterations needed.

### Conclusion
The Frank-Wolfe algorithm is a powerful tool for solving convex optimization problems, especially in transportation planning for traffic assignment. By iteratively improving the flow distribution based on current travel costs, it ensures that the traffic network reaches a user equilibrium as described by Wardrop's First Principle.
