# Bond Graph Theory

[[Bond graph theory]] provides a unified graphical and mathematical framework for modeling [[dynamic systems]] across multiple physical domains. This approach emphasizes [[energy flow]] and [[power transfer]] relationships through a standardized notation.

## Fundamental Concepts

### Power Variables
Every [[power bond]] carries two conjugate variables:
- [[Effort]] (e): force, voltage, pressure, temperature, etc.
- [[Flow]] (f): velocity, current, volumetric flow, entropy flow, etc.

The [[instantaneous power]] (P) through any bond is:
P = ef

### Basic Elements
1. [[Storage Elements]]:
   - [[Capacitive]] (C): stores effort (∫f dt)
   - [[Inductive]] (I): stores flow (∫e dt)

2. [[Dissipative Elements]]:
   - [[Resistive]] (R): relates e and f directly

3. [[Source Elements]]:
   - [[Effort Source]] (Se): imposes effort
   - [[Flow Source]] (Sf): imposes flow

4. [[Junction Elements]]:
   - [[0-junction]]: common effort
   - [[1-junction]]: common flow

## Mathematical Framework

### State Space Formulation
For a system with n storage elements, the [[state vector]] x contains the [[generalized momentum]] (p) and [[generalized displacement]] (q):

x = [p₁, ..., pₙ, q₁, ..., qₙ]ᵀ

The [[state equations]] take the form:

dx/dt = f(x, u)

where u represents external inputs.

### Causality Assignment
[[Computational causality]] determines the direction of effort-flow computation. The [[causality stroke]] indicates which variable (e or f) is imposed on the connected element:

- Integral causality: preferred for simulation
- Derivative causality: may arise in constraints

## Systematic Modeling Process

1. Identify system components and their interconnections
2. Draw bond graph with power bonds
3. Assign causality following [[sequential causality assignment procedure]] (SCAP)
4. Derive system equations through [[junction structure analysis]]
5. Obtain [[state space representation]]

## Multi-Domain Applications

Bond graphs naturally handle:
- [[Electromechanical systems]]
- [[Hydraulic-mechanical systems]]
- [[Thermodynamic systems]]
- [[Chemical processes]]

Through unified representation of [[power flow]] and [[energy storage]], enabling systematic analysis of complex, coupled systems.

## Advanced Concepts

### Multiport Elements
[[Multiport components]] represent complex subsystems with multiple power interactions:
- [[Transformers]] (TF): conserve power with fixed ratio
- [[Gyrators]] (GY): exchange effort and flow domains

### Modulated Elements
[[Modulated components]] have properties controlled by external signals:
- [[Modulated transformer]] (MTF)
- [[Modulated gyrator]] (MGY)

This formalism provides a rigorous foundation for [[automated modeling]] and [[numerical simulation]] of complex physical systems.
