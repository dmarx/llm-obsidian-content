Geometric interpretation


**ASSISTANT**

Understanding the geometric interpretation of the Jacobian determinant and its role in [[normalizing flows]], specifically RealNVP, provides deeper insights into how these transformations manipulate the probability densities and volumes in the input space.

## Geometric Interpretation of the Jacobian Determinant

### Volume Transformation

The Jacobian determinant quantifies how a transformation scales volumes in the input space. Given a function \( f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n \), the Jacobian matrix \( \mathbf{J} \) at a point \( \mathbf{z} \) describes the local linear approximation of \( f \) around \( \mathbf{z} \). For an infinitesimal volume element \( d\mathbf{z} \) around \( \mathbf{z} \), the transformation \( f \) maps it to a new volume element \( d\mathbf{x} \) in the output space. The relationship between these volume elements is given by the Jacobian determinant:

$$
d\mathbf{x} = \left| \det(\mathbf{J}) \right| d\mathbf{z}
$$

Thus, the Jacobian determinant represents the factor by which the transformation \( f \) scales the volume at each point.

### Change of Density

When transforming a probability distribution, the density function must account for this volume scaling to ensure that probabilities are preserved. For a transformation \( \mathbf{x} = f(\mathbf{z}) \), the density \( p_X(\mathbf{x}) \) in the output space relates to the density \( p_Z(\mathbf{z}) \) in the input space as follows:

$$
p_X(\mathbf{x}) = p_Z(\mathbf{z}) \left| \det \left( \frac{\partial f(\mathbf{z})}{\partial \mathbf{z}} \right) \right|^{-1}
$$

Here, the Jacobian determinant ensures that the transformed density \( p_X(\mathbf{x}) \) correctly reflects how the transformation \( f \) stretches or compresses the space.

## Geometric Interpretation in RealNVP

### Coupling Layer Transformation

In RealNVP, the transformation is performed using affine coupling layers. Consider an input vector \( \mathbf{z} \) split into two parts \( \mathbf{z}_A \) and \( \mathbf{z}_B \). The transformation applied to \( \mathbf{z}_B \) is conditioned on \( \mathbf{z}_A \):

$$
\mathbf{z}_A' = \mathbf{z}_A \\
\mathbf{z}_B' = \mathbf{z}_B \odot \exp(s(\mathbf{z}_A)) + t(\mathbf{z}_A)
$$

#### Visualization

1. **Affine Transformation**: The transformation of \( \mathbf{z}_B \) involves scaling by \( \exp(s(\mathbf{z}_A)) \) and translating by \( t(\mathbf{z}_A) \). Geometrically, this means that each component of \( \mathbf{z}_B \) is stretched or compressed and then shifted according to the values in \( \mathbf{z}_A \).

2. **Volume Scaling**: The Jacobian determinant for this transformation is:

   $$
   \det(\mathbf{J}) = \exp\left( \sum_i s(\mathbf{z}_A)_i \right)
   $$

   This determinant indicates how the transformation scales the volume of an infinitesimal region around \( \mathbf{z} \). If \( s(\mathbf{z}_A) \) has positive components, the volume is expanded; if negative, the volume is contracted.

3. **Invertibility**: The transformation is invertible, meaning there is a one-to-one correspondence between \( \mathbf{z} \) and \( \mathbf{z}' \). This invertibility ensures that no information is lost during the transformation, and the density can be correctly computed in both directions.

### Impact on Density

The geometric interpretation of the Jacobian determinant in RealNVP highlights its role in adjusting the density under the transformation. Since the determinant quantifies volume changes, it ensures that the probability mass is preserved. For example, if the transformation compresses a region of the space (volume decreases), the density in that region increases proportionally to maintain the total probability.

## Example

Consider a simple 2-dimensional case where \( \mathbf{z} = (z_1, z_2) \) and we apply a single affine coupling layer:

1. **Initial Split**:
   \[
   \mathbf{z}_A = z_1, \quad \mathbf{z}_B = z_2
   \]

2. **Transformation**:
   \[
   z_1' = z_1
   \]
   \[
   z_2' = z_2 \cdot \exp(s(z_1)) + t(z_1)
   \]

   Suppose \( s(z_1) = \log 2 \) and \( t(z_1) = 3 \):

   \[
   z_2' = z_2 \cdot 2 + 3
   \]

3. **Jacobian Matrix**:
   \[
   \mathbf{J} = \begin{pmatrix}
   1 & 0 \\
   0 & 2
   \end{pmatrix}
   \]

4. **Jacobian Determinant**:
   \[
   \det(\mathbf{J}) = 1 \cdot 2 = 2
   \]

5. **Density Transformation**:
   If \( p_Z(z_1, z_2) \) is the density of the base distribution, the transformed density \( p_X(x_1, x_2) \) is:

   \[
   p_X(x_1, x_2) = p_Z(z_1, z_2) \cdot \frac{1}{2}
   \]

   Here, the factor \( \frac{1}{2} \) accounts for the doubling of the volume (since \( \det(\mathbf{J}) = 2 \)).

## Conclusion

The Jacobian determinant provides a geometric interpretation of how transformations in [[normalizing flows]], including RealNVP, scale volumes in the input space. By quantifying volume changes, it ensures that probability densities are correctly transformed, preserving the total probability mass. In RealNVP, the efficient computation of the Jacobian determinant through affine coupling layers enables scalable and expressive density modeling, facilitating various applications in generative modeling and probabilistic inference.
