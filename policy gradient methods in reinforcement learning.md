## Policy Gradient Methods in Reinforcement Learning

### Overview

Policy gradient methods are a class of [[reinforcement learning]] (RL) algorithms that optimize the policy directly by adjusting its parameters in the direction that maximizes expected cumulative reward. Unlike value-based methods, which estimate the value function, policy gradient methods focus on finding the optimal policy by performing gradient ascent on the policy's performance objective.

### Key Concepts

1. **Policy**: A mapping from states to actions, parameterized by \(\theta\), denoted as \(\pi_\theta(a|s)\).
2. **Objective Function**: The expected cumulative reward, which the algorithm aims to maximize.
3. **Gradient Ascent**: An optimization technique used to adjust policy parameters to maximize the objective function.

### Objective Function

The objective in policy gradient methods is to maximize the expected return (cumulative reward) from the start state, often expressed as:

\[
J(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_\pi [G_t] = \mathbb{E}_\pi \left[ \sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t R(s_t, a_t) \right]
\]

where:
- \(G_t\) is the return at time step \(t\).
- \(\gamma\) is the discount factor.
- \(R(s_t, a_t)\) is the reward received after taking action \(a_t\) in state \(s_t\).

### Policy Gradient Theorem

The policy gradient theorem provides the foundation for policy gradient methods by expressing the gradient of the objective function \(J(\theta)\) with respect to the policy parameters \(\theta\):

\[
\nabla_\theta J(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_\pi \left[ \nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a|s) Q^\pi(s, a) \right]
\]

where:
- \(\nabla_\theta\) denotes the gradient with respect to \(\theta\).
- \(Q^\pi(s, a)\) is the action-value function, representing the expected return after taking action \(a\) in state \(s\) under policy \(\pi\).

### REINFORCE Algorithm

The REINFORCE algorithm is a Monte Carlo policy gradient method that uses sampled trajectories to update the policy parameters. The key steps are:

1. **Sample Trajectories**: Generate a set of trajectories by running the current policy \(\pi_\theta\).
2. **Compute Returns**: Calculate the return \(G_t\) for each time step \(t\) in the trajectory.
3. **Update Policy**: Update the policy parameters \(\theta\) using the gradient estimate:

\[
\theta \leftarrow \theta + \alpha \sum_{t=0}^\infty \nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a_t | s_t) G_t
\]

where \(\alpha\) is the learning rate.

### Algorithm Steps

1. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize policy parameters \(\theta\).
   - Set learning rate \(\alpha\).

2. **Sampling**:
   - For each episode:
     - Initialize state \(s_0\).
     - For each time step \(t\):
       - Select action \(a_t\) according to policy \(\pi_\theta(a_t | s_t)\).
       - Execute action \(a_t\), observe reward \(R_{t+1}\) and next state \(s_{t+1}\).
       - Store \((s_t, a_t, R_{t+1})\).

3. **Return Calculation**:
   - For each time step \(t\) in the episode:
     - Compute the return \(G_t = \sum_{k=t}^\infty \gamma^{k-t} R_{k+1}\).

4. **Policy Update**:
   - For each time step \(t\) in the episode:
     - Update policy parameters \(\theta\) using:

     \[
     \theta \leftarrow \theta + \alpha \nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a_t | s_t) G_t
     \]

### Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C)

The Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm is an extension of policy gradient methods that combines policy gradient (actor) and value function (critic) approaches. The advantage function \(A^\pi(s, a)\) is used to reduce variance in the gradient estimate.

#### Advantage Function

The advantage function \(A^\pi(s, a)\) represents how much better an action is compared to the average action at a given state:

\[
A^\pi(s, a) = Q^\pi(s, a) - V^\pi(s)
\]

#### A2C Algorithm Steps

1. **Initialize**:
   - Initialize actor parameters \(\theta\).
   - Initialize critic parameters \(\phi\).

2. **Sampling**:
   - For each episode:
     - Initialize state \(s_0\).
     - For each time step \(t\):
       - Select action \(a_t\) according to policy \(\pi_\theta(a_t | s_t)\).
       - Execute action \(a_t\), observe reward \(R_{t+1}\) and next state \(s_{t+1}\).
       - Store \((s_t, a_t, R_{t+1})\).

3. **Return and Advantage Calculation**:
   - For each time step \(t\) in the episode:
     - Compute the return \(G_t = \sum_{k=t}^\infty \gamma^{k-t} R_{k+1}\).
     - Estimate value \(V^\pi(s_t)\) using the critic.
     - Compute advantage \(A^\pi(s_t, a_t) = G_t - V^\pi(s_t)\).

4. **Policy and Value Update**:
   - For each time step \(t\) in the episode:
     - Update actor parameters \(\theta\):

     \[
     \theta \leftarrow \theta + \alpha \nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a_t | s_t) A^\pi(s_t, a_t)
     \]

     - Update critic parameters \(\phi\) by minimizing the loss:

     \[
     L(\phi) = \left( G_t - V^\pi(s_t) \right)^2
     \]

### Example: REINFORCE Algorithm in Python

```python
import numpy as np
import gym

env = gym.make('CartPole-v1')
n_actions = env.action_space.n
state_dim = env.observation_space.shape[0]

# Policy network
class PolicyNetwork:
    def __init__(self, state_dim, n_actions):
        self.state_dim = state_dim
        self.n_actions = n_actions
        self.theta = np.random.rand(state_dim, n_actions)

    def policy(self, state):
        z = state.dot(self.theta)
        exp = np.exp(z)
        return exp / np.sum(exp)

    def get_action(self, state):
        probs = self.policy(state)
        return np.random.choice(self.n_actions, p=probs)

    def update(self, grad_log_probs, returns, alpha):
        for grad, G in zip(grad_log_probs, returns):
            self.theta += alpha * grad * G

policy_net = PolicyNetwork(state_dim, n_actions)
alpha = 0.01
gamma = 0.99

def compute_returns(rewards, gamma):
    returns = []
    G = 0
    for r in reversed(rewards):
        G = r + gamma * G
        returns.insert(0, G)
    return returns

# Training loop
for episode in range(1000):
    state = env.reset()
    states = []
    actions = []
    rewards = []
    grad_log_probs = []
    
    done = False
    while not done:
        action = policy_net.get_action(state)
        next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
        
        # Store transition
        states.append(state)
        actions.append(action)
        rewards.append(reward)
        
        # Compute gradient of log-probability
        probs = policy_net.policy(state)
        grad_log_prob = -probs
        grad_log_prob[action] += 1
        grad_log_probs.append(grad_log_prob)
        
        state = next_state
    
    # Compute returns
    returns = compute_returns(rewards, gamma)
    
    # Update policy network
    policy_net.update(grad_log_probs, returns, alpha)

    if episode % 100 == 0:
        print(f'Episode {episode}: Total Reward: {sum(rewards)}')
```

### Applications of Policy Gradient Methods

### Conclusion

Policy gradient methods are powerful tools in [[reinforcement learning]] that optimize policies directly by performing gradient ascent on the expected cumulative reward. By leveraging techniques such as REINFORCE and actor-critic methods, policy gradient algorithms can handle complex, high-dimensional action spaces and learn sophisticated policies for a wide range of applications. Implementing these methods requires a deep understanding of the underlying mathematical principles and careful tuning of hyperparameters to achieve optimal performance.
