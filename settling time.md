# Settling Time

Settling time is a fundamental concept in [[control theory]] and [[dynamical systems]] that quantifies how quickly a system stabilizes to its [[steady-state]] behavior after experiencing a [[transient response]]. It is a critical performance metric in engineering design, particularly for [[control systems]], [[electronic circuits]], and [[mechanical systems]].

## Mathematical Definition

For a time-varying signal $y(t)$ with final value $y_{\infty}$, the settling time $T_s$ is defined as:

$$T_s = \min\{T \geq 0 : |y(t) - y_{\infty}| \leq \epsilon |y_{\infty}| \text{ for all } t \geq T\}$$

where $\epsilon$ is a specified tolerance, typically expressed as a percentage of the final value. Common values include:
- 5% settling time: $\epsilon = 0.05$
- 2% settling time: $\epsilon = 0.02$
- 1% settling time: $\epsilon = 0.01$

For signals that settle to zero, an absolute tolerance is used instead:

$$T_s = \min\{T \geq 0 : |y(t)| \leq \delta \text{ for all } t \geq T\}$$

where $\delta$ is a small positive constant.

## Analytical Expressions for Linear Systems

### Second-Order Systems

For a standard second-order system with transfer function:

$$G(s) = \frac{\omega_n^2}{s^2 + 2\zeta\omega_n s + \omega_n^2}$$

where $\omega_n$ is the [[natural frequency]] and $\zeta$ is the [[damping ratio]], the settling time can be approximated as:

$$T_s \approx \frac{-\ln(\epsilon)}{\zeta\omega_n}$$

For the commonly used 2% criterion, this becomes:

$$T_s \approx \frac{4}{\zeta\omega_n}$$

This approximation is valid for underdamped systems ($0 < \zeta < 1$).

### First-Order Systems

For a first-order system with transfer function:

$$G(s) = \frac{K}{\tau s + 1}$$

where $\tau$ is the [[time constant]], the settling time is approximately:

$$T_s \approx -\tau\ln(\epsilon)$$

For the 2% criterion, this gives:

$$T_s \approx 4\tau$$

## Factors Affecting Settling Time

1. **Damping**: Increasing damping reduces oscillations but may increase settling time
   - Underdamped systems ($\zeta < 1$): Oscillate around the steady-state
   - Critically damped ($\zeta = 1$): Fastest return to steady-state without oscillation
   - Overdamped ($\zeta > 1$): Slow approach without oscillation

2. **Natural frequency**: Higher natural frequencies generally lead to faster settling times

3. **Zeros and additional poles**: Modify the transient response and can significantly affect settling time

4. **Nonlinearities**: Introduce complexity that often requires numerical analysis

## Measurement Techniques

### Experimental Determination

1. Apply a [[step input]] to the system
2. Record the output response
3. Identify the final steady-state value
4. Calculate the tolerance band around the final value
5. Determine the last time the response exits this band

### Numerical Calculation

For simulated systems:
```python
def calculate_settling_time(time_array, response, final_value, tolerance=0.02):
    # Calculate the tolerance band
    band_upper = final_value * (1 + tolerance)
    band_lower = final_value * (1 - tolerance)
    
    # Find all times when response is outside the band
    outside_band_indices = [i for i, y in enumerate(response) 
                            if y > band_upper or y < band_lower]
    
    if not outside_band_indices:
        return 0  # Already within band
    
    # Return the last time response exits the band
    last_exit_index = max(outside_band_indices)
    return time_array[last_exit_index]
```

## Trade-offs with Other Performance Metrics

Settling time is often in tension with other key performance metrics:

1. **[[Rise time]]**: Faster rise times can lead to increased overshoot and longer settling times
2. **[[Overshoot]]**: Minimizing overshoot typically increases rise time
3. **[[Steady-state error]]**: Aggressive control to reduce settling time may increase steady-state error
4. **[[Control effort]]**: Reducing settling time often requires greater actuator effort

These trade-offs can be visualized in a [[Pareto frontier]] that shows the achievable combinations of performance metrics.

## Applications in Different Fields

### Control Engineering

- [[PID controller]] tuning prioritizes settling time for processes requiring quick stabilization
- [[Model predictive control]] explicitly considers settling time in its performance objective
- [[Servo systems]] designed for precise positioning with minimal settling time

### Electronic Circuit Design

- [[Filter design]] balances settling time with frequency response characteristics
- [[Power supply]] regulators need fast settling after load changes
- [[Analog-to-digital converters]] require predictable settling for accurate readings

### Mechanical Systems

- [[Vibration damping]] targets reduced settling time after disturbances
- [[Positioning systems]] (robotics, CNC machines) optimize for minimal settling time
- [[Structural dynamics]] analysis considers settling time after impact or environmental forces

## Advanced Concepts

### Guaranteed Settling Time

Some [[nonlinear control]] techniques provide guaranteed finite settling time, where the system reaches steady-state exactly (not asymptotically) within a provable time bound.

### Minimum-Time Control

[[Optimal control]] theory can determine control inputs that minimize settling time, often leading to [[bang-bang control]] strategies that saturate actuators.

### Robust Settling Time

[[Robust control]] examines how settling time is affected by model uncertainties and external disturbances, ensuring performance across a range of operating conditions.

## Mathematical Extensions

### Discrete-Time Systems

For discrete-time systems, settling time is defined in terms of samples:

$$N_s = \min\{N \in \mathbb{N} : |y[n] - y_{\infty}| \leq \epsilon |y_{\infty}| \text{ for all } n \geq N\}$$

### Stochastic Systems

For systems with random disturbances, settling time becomes a random variable, often characterized by:
- Expected settling time: $E[T_s]$
- Probabilistic bounds: $P(T_s \leq T_{max}) \geq 1-\alpha$

### Practical Settling Time

In some applications, a relaxed definition allows for occasional excursions outside the tolerance band after the settling time:

$$T_s^p = \min\{T \geq 0 : P(|y(t) - y_{\infty}| \leq \epsilon |y_{\infty}| \text{ for } t \geq T) \geq 1-\delta\}$$

# Dominant Pole

A dominant pole is a key concept in [[linear systems theory]] that refers to a specific [[pole]] (or pair of complex conjugate poles) in a [[transfer function]] that predominantly determines the system's [[transient response]]. The concept is fundamental to understanding and approximating the dynamic behavior of complex systems, particularly in [[control systems]], [[signal processing]], and [[electrical engineering]].

## Mathematical Formalization

Consider a linear time-invariant (LTI) system with transfer function:

$$G(s) = \frac{K \prod_{i=1}^{m} (s-z_i)}{\prod_{j=1}^{n} (s-p_j)}$$

where:
- $K$ is a constant gain
- $z_i$ are the [[zeros]] of the system
- $p_j$ are the [[poles]] of the system

A pole $p_k$ is considered dominant if it satisfies these conditions:

1. It is closer to the imaginary axis than other poles (has the least negative real part in a stable system)
2. Its residue in the [[partial fraction expansion]] has significant magnitude compared to other poles
3. It is not "canceled" or nearly canceled by a nearby zero

## Identifying Dominant Poles

For a stable system (all poles in the left half-plane), the poles can be ranked by their dominance using the following criteria:

### Distance from Imaginary Axis

The time constant associated with each pole is inversely proportional to the magnitude of its real part:

$$\tau_i = \frac{1}{|\text{Re}(p_i)|}$$

Poles with smaller $|\text{Re}(p_i)|$ (longer time constants) have more persistent effects on the system response.

### Residue Magnitude

In the partial fraction expansion:

$$G(s) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{R_i}{s-p_i}$$

The residue $R_i$ for each pole is calculated as:

$$R_i = \lim_{s \to p_i} (s-p_i)G(s)$$

Poles with larger residue magnitudes contribute more significantly to the overall response.

### Pole-Zero Proximity

A pole $p_i$ that is close to a zero $z_j$ experiences [[pole-zero cancellation]]:

$$\text{If } |p_i - z_j| \ll |\text{Re}(p_i)|, \text{ then the effect of } p_i \text{ is diminished}$$

## Dominant Pole Approximation

The dominant pole approximation simplifies a higher-order system by retaining only the dominant poles and adjusting the gain to maintain the same steady-state behavior. This results in a lower-order model that approximates the original system's essential dynamics.

For a system with a single dominant real pole $p_1$:

$$G_{approx}(s) = \frac{G(0)}{1 - \frac{s}{p_1}}$$

For a system with a dominant complex conjugate pair $p_{1,2} = \sigma \pm j\omega$:

$$G_{approx}(s) = \frac{G(0)\omega_n^2}{s^2 + 2\zeta\omega_n s + \omega_n^2}$$

where:
- $\omega_n = \sqrt{\sigma^2 + \omega^2}$ is the [[natural frequency]]
- $\zeta = -\sigma/\omega_n$ is the [[damping ratio]]

## Properties of Systems with Different Dominant Poles

### Single Real Dominant Pole

A system with a single real dominant pole $p = -a$ (where $a > 0$) has:

- Transfer function approximation: $G(s) \approx \frac{K}{s+a}$
- Step response: $y(t) \approx K(1-e^{-at})$
- [[Time constant]]: $\tau = \frac{1}{a}$
- [[Settling time]] (2%): $T_s \approx 4\tau = \frac{4}{a}$
- No [[overshoot]] or oscillation
- [[Rise time]] (10% to 90%): $T_r \approx 2.2\tau = \frac{2.2}{a}$

### Complex Conjugate Dominant Poles

A system with dominant complex conjugate poles $p_{1,2} = -\zeta\omega_n \pm j\omega_n\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}$ has:

- Transfer function approximation: $G(s) \approx \frac{K\omega_n^2}{s^2 + 2\zeta\omega_n s + \omega_n^2}$
- Step response: $y(t) \approx K(1-e^{-\zeta\omega_n t}\cos(\omega_n\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}t + \phi))$
- [[Natural frequency]]: $\omega_n$
- [[Damping ratio]]: $\zeta$
- Percent overshoot: $PO = 100e^{-\pi\zeta/\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}}$
- [[Settling time]] (2%): $T_s \approx \frac{4}{\zeta\omega_n}$
- [[Rise time]] (10% to 90%): $T_r \approx \frac{1.8}{\omega_n}$ (for $\zeta \approx 0.5$)
- [[Oscillation frequency]]: $\omega_d = \omega_n\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}$

## Applications in System Analysis and Design

### Control System Design

1. **Root Locus Design**: Placing dominant poles to achieve desired transient characteristics
2. **PID Controller Tuning**: Adjusting controller parameters to position dominant poles
3. **Lead-Lag Compensation**: Adding zeros and poles to modify the dominant pole location

### Model Reduction

1. **Modal Approximation**: Retaining only modes associated with dominant poles
2. **Balanced Truncation**: Identifying and preserving dominant poles based on [[controllability]] and [[observability]] properties
3. **Hankel Singular Value Decomposition**: Quantifying the energy contribution of different modes

### Signal Processing

1. **Filter Design**: Positioning dominant poles to achieve desired frequency response characteristics
2. **Audio and Speech Processing**: Modeling formants and resonances using dominant poles
3. **Image Processing**: Designing spatial filters with specific transient properties

## Limitations and Considerations

1. **Non-Minimum Phase Systems**: Zeros in the right half-plane can significantly influence behavior despite dominant pole analysis
2. **Closely Spaced Poles**: When multiple poles have similar real parts, the dominant pole approximation may be inadequate
3. **Large-Scale Systems**: In high-order systems, clusters of poles may behave collectively rather than individually
4. **Nonlinear Systems**: The concept applies only to linearized models around operating points

## Symbolic Notation for Dominance Analysis

We can formalize a dominance metric $D(p_i)$ for each pole $p_i$:

$$D(p_i) = \frac{|R_i|}{\text{Re}(p_i)} \prod_{j=1}^{m} \frac{|p_i - z_j|}{|p_i| + |z_j|}$$

This metric incorporates:
- Residue magnitude $|R_i|$
- Proximity to the imaginary axis via $\text{Re}(p_i)$
- Distance from zeros through the product term

Poles with larger values of $D(p_i)$ are more dominant.
