**USER**

does the concept of a "dual group" have application outside of LCA? is there a more general definition of "dual group" that isn't LCA specific?


**ASSISTANT**

The concept of a "dual group" is most naturally and prominently developed in the context of locally compact abelian (LCA) groups, where it plays a fundamental role in harmonic analysis through Pontryagin duality. However, the idea of duality, and dual structures more broadly, does have applications and interpretations outside of the strictly LCA framework, extending to various areas of mathematics including non-abelian groups, algebraic groups, and beyond. The generalizations and other notions of "dual" involve extending the core idea of examining the structure of a group through the lens of homomorphisms defined on it, though these generalizations may not always carry the label "dual group" explicitly.

### Dual Objects in Non-abelian Groups

For non-abelian groups, the notion of a dual group in the sense of Pontryagin duality does not apply directly due to the lack of commutativity. However, there are concepts that capture some aspects of duality:

- **Representation Theory**: One can study the dual space of a group representation, which consists of linear functionals that are invariant under the action induced by the group. This forms the basis for understanding dualities in the representation theory of non-abelian groups.
  
- **Character Theory**: For finite groups, character theory plays a role analogous to that of Pontryagin duality in LCA groups, studying group representations through the trace function of matrices. Characters offer insight into the structure of the group similar to how characters (homomorphisms to $S^1$) do for LCA groups.

### Generalized Duality Concepts

- **Algebraic Groups and Schemes**: In algebraic geometry, the concept of duality exists for algebraic groups, especially over fields. The dual of an algebraic group, particularly for groups like elliptic curves, involves considering the group of divisors modulo rational equivalence, leading to the theory of abelian varieties and their duals.
  
- **Category Theory**: Duality principles in category theory abstract the notion of dual objects through the concept of opposite categories. While this is a more abstract and generalized form of duality, it captures the essence of "opposite" or "dual" structures across mathematics, including groups.

- **Quantum Groups**: In the study of quantum groups, a form of non-commutative duality exists between Hopf algebras and their duals, reflecting a generalized notion of symmetry in quantum and non-commutative spaces.

### Applications Beyond Traditional Dual Groups

While the specific construct of a dual group as understood in the context of LCA groups might not directly generalize to non-abelian groups or other structures, the underlying principles of duality manifest in various forms across mathematics, often playing crucial roles in the study of symmetries, dualities, and inverse problems in different settings. These generalized notions of duality continue to influence the development of theoretical physics, algebraic geometry, category theory, and beyond, highlighting the deep interconnectedness of the concept of duality in mathematics.
