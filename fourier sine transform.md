fourier sine transform


**ASSISTANT**

The Fourier sine transform is a specific form of the Fourier transform that is used for functions defined on the half-line, typically $[0, \infty)$. It decomposes a function into an integral of sine waves, capturing the function's frequency content. This transform is particularly useful for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with specific boundary conditions, such as the Dirichlet boundary condition where the function vanishes at the origin.

### Definition

Given a function \( f(x) \) defined for \( x \geq 0 \), the Fourier sine transform \( \mathcal{F}_s \{f(x)\}(k) \) is defined as:

$$
\mathcal{F}_s \{f(x)\}(k) = \int_{0}^{\infty} f(x) \sin(kx) \, dx
$$

Here, \( k \) represents the frequency variable, and the transform maps the function \( f(x) \) to its frequency domain representation \( \hat{f}(k) \).

### Inverse Fourier Sine Transform

The inverse Fourier sine transform is used to recover the original function \( f(x) \) from its sine transform \( \hat{f}(k) \). It is given by:

$$
f(x) = \frac{2}{\pi} \int_{0}^{\infty} \hat{f}(k) \sin(kx) \, dk
$$

### Properties

1. **Linearity**: The Fourier sine transform is a linear operator. For any functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) and scalars \( a \) and \( b \):

$$
\mathcal{F}_s \{ a f(x) + b g(x) \}(k) = a \mathcal{F}_s \{ f(x) \}(k) + b \mathcal{F}_s \{ g(x) \}(k)
$$

2. **Derivatives**: If \( f(x) \) is sufficiently smooth, the sine transform of its derivative is:

$$
\mathcal{F}_s \left\{ \frac{d f}{dx} \right\}(k) = k \mathcal{F}_c \{ f(x) \}(k)
$$

where \( \mathcal{F}_c \{ f(x) \}(k) \) denotes the Fourier cosine transform, defined as:

$$
\mathcal{F}_c \{ f(x) \}(k) = \int_{0}^{\infty} f(x) \cos(kx) \, dx
$$

3. **Parsevalâ€™s Theorem**: For functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \):

$$
\int_{0}^{\infty} f(x) g(x) \, dx = \frac{2}{\pi} \int_{0}^{\infty} \mathcal{F}_s \{ f(x) \}(k) \mathcal{F}_s \{ g(x) \}(k) \, dk
$$

### Applications

The Fourier sine transform is used in various fields, including:

- **Solving PDEs**: Particularly for the heat equation, wave equation, and Laplace's equation in domains where the function satisfies Dirichlet boundary conditions.
- **Signal Processing**: In analyzing signals that are zero or symmetric around the origin.
- **Optics and Quantum Mechanics**: For problems involving wave functions and potential wells.

### Example

Consider the function \( f(x) = e^{-ax} \) for \( x \geq 0 \) with \( a > 0 \). The Fourier sine transform is:

$$
\mathcal{F}_s \{ e^{-ax} \}(k) = \int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-ax} \sin(kx) \, dx
$$

Using integration by parts, we get:

$$
\mathcal{F}_s \{ e^{-ax} \}(k) = \frac{k}{a^2 + k^2}
$$

Inverting this transform would retrieve the original function \( f(x) = e^{-ax} \).

The Fourier sine transform provides a powerful tool for analyzing and solving problems in mathematical physics and engineering, particularly when dealing with semi-infinite domains and specific boundary conditions.
