**USER**

Harry Frankfurt’s Model


**ASSISTANT**

**Harry Frankfurt's model** of free will, often referred to as the **theory of second-order desires**, provides a sophisticated framework for understanding human agency and moral responsibility, particularly in the context of conflicting desires and compulsive behavior. Frankfurt's model distinguishes between different types of desires and introduces the concept of **higher-order volitions**, which are central to his account of free will.

### 1. **First-Order Desires and Second-Order Desires**

At the core of Frankfurt's model is the distinction between **first-order** and **second-order desires**:

#### **First-Order Desires**
- These are **basic desires** that prompt us to act. They represent the desires or urges we experience in our everyday life, such as the desire to eat, sleep, watch pornography, or avoid pain. 
- **Example**: A person might have a **first-order desire** to eat a slice of cake or to consume pornography when they feel a strong urge.

First-order desires are present in both humans and animals. They drive behavior at a fundamental level, but **acting on a first-order desire** alone doesn’t imply that a person has free will. In Frankfurt's view, free will involves more than just acting on any desire that arises—it involves reflection and choice.

#### **Second-Order Desires**
- **Second-order desires** are **desires about desires**. They reflect our capacity to **reflect on our first-order desires** and make decisions about whether or not we want those desires to move us to action.
- **Example**: A person might have a **second-order desire** to avoid eating unhealthy food, even though they have a first-order desire to eat cake. Similarly, a person may have a **second-order desire** to stop consuming pornography, even though they feel a strong urge to do so.

What distinguishes humans from non-human animals, according to Frankfurt, is this ability to **evaluate our desires** at a higher level. This reflective capacity gives rise to questions of **authenticity**: Which desires do we *want* to define us? Which desires do we endorse, and which do we reject?

### 2. **Second-Order Volitions and Free Will**

A critical part of Frankfurt's model is the distinction between **second-order desires** and **second-order volitions**:

#### **Second-Order Volitions**
- A **second-order volition** is not just a desire about a desire; it is the desire that a specific first-order desire becomes **effective** in leading to action.
- In other words, a second-order volition is when you not only have a desire to act in a certain way, but you also **want** that desire to move you to act. This is central to **free will**, as it reflects the desire to be motivated by certain desires and not others.

Frankfurt argues that having free will involves aligning our **effective first-order desires** (those that move us to act) with our **second-order volitions** (our reflective endorsement of those desires). In his view:
- **Free will** occurs when we want to act on a first-order desire, and we also *want* that desire to move us to action.
- **Lack of free will** arises when a person is **moved by desires** that they do **not endorse** at the level of second-order volitions.

#### **Example**: The Addict
Frankfurt’s famous example involves an addict:
- The **addict** has a strong **first-order desire** to take drugs. However, they may have a **second-order desire** to quit drugs because they recognize the harmful effects.
- If the addict **wants to stop** taking drugs but finds themselves compelled to act on the first-order desire (to take drugs), they experience a **conflict** between their first-order desire and second-order volition.
  - In this case, the addict lacks **free will** because their first-order desire to take drugs is **not endorsed** by their second-order volition (they don’t want this desire to motivate them).

This distinction allows Frankfurt to explain how someone can act on an **uncontrollable urge** (like addiction or compulsive behavior) but **not act freely**. The person may not be able to align their actions with their second-order volitions, meaning their behavior does not reflect their true self or what they rationally endorse.

### 3. **Freedom of Action vs. Freedom of Will**

Frankfurt’s model distinguishes between **freedom of action** and **freedom of will**:

- **Freedom of Action**: The ability to act according to one’s first-order desires. This is a basic form of freedom that is shared with animals. Even an addict has freedom of action in the sense that they can still take drugs.
- **Freedom of Will**: The ability to **make the desires you endorse effective in leading to action**. This is the deeper form of freedom that involves second-order volitions. In the case of the addict, they may have freedom of action (they can still take drugs) but lack **freedom of will** because they are not able to act in accordance with their second-order volition to stop using drugs.

### 4. **Implications for Compulsive Behavior and Addiction**

Frankfurt’s model is highly applicable to cases of **compulsive behavior**, such as compulsive pornography use, addiction, or other behaviors driven by **strong urges**. In such cases, individuals may experience:
- A strong **first-order desire** (e.g., to watch pornography).
- A **second-order desire** to **stop acting** on that first-order desire (e.g., to resist the urge to watch pornography).
- A **lack of control** where they feel unable to make their second-order volition effective, meaning they are unable to act in line with their reflective self.

This lack of control suggests that while individuals may still have **freedom of action** (they act on their first-order desires), they lack **freedom of will** because their actions do not align with their higher-order reflective desires.

### 5. **Relevance to Free Will and Moral Responsibility**

Frankfurt’s model has profound implications for **free will** and **moral responsibility**:
- **Moral Responsibility**: Frankfurt argues that we are morally responsible for our actions when our first-order desires align with our second-order volitions. When we are unable to align our actions with what we reflectively endorse (e.g., in the case of compulsive behavior or addiction), our moral responsibility might be mitigated because our will is not truly free.
- **Degrees of Control**: Even when people feel they cannot control their first-order desires in the short term, they may still retain **some control** at the level of second-order volitions (e.g., they can seek help, undergo treatment, or engage in therapy to realign their desires).

This helps to explain why individuals struggling with addiction or compulsive behaviors can still be seen as **agents** capable of making choices, even if their ability to control specific urges is diminished.

### 6. **Criticisms and Extensions of Frankfurt’s Model**

While Frankfurt’s theory of second-order desires has been influential, it has also faced several criticisms and extensions:
- **Infinite Regress Problem**: Critics argue that there could be an infinite regress of higher-order desires (i.e., second-order, third-order, etc.). How do we stop at second-order desires as the final measure of free will? Frankfurt responds that second-order desires suffice because they reflect our capacity for reflection and rational evaluation.
- **External Constraints**: Some have pointed out that Frankfurt’s model may not adequately account for **external constraints** on freedom, such as social, economic, or political factors that limit an individual's ability to act on their desires.
  
Despite these criticisms, Frankfurt's model remains a powerful tool for understanding free will in cases where **internal conflicts of desires** play a central role in human behavior, especially in cases of addiction, compulsive behavior, or situations where individuals struggle to align their actions with their reflective selves.

### Conclusion

Harry Frankfurt’s model of free will, centered around the concepts of **first-order desires**, **second-order desires**, and **second-order volitions**, offers a nuanced understanding of **human agency**. It provides a way to think about free will that allows for the possibility of internal conflicts between what we want and what we endorse at a higher level of reflection. In cases of addiction or compulsive behavior, individuals may lack **freedom of will** (because they act on desires they do not endorse), but they still have **degrees of agency** and responsibility based on their capacity to reflect on and potentially reshape their desires over time.
