**USER**

Partition of Unity


**ASSISTANT**

A **partition of unity** is a mathematical tool used in [[differential topology]] and analysis to construct global objects from local data. It allows for the extension of locally defined functions to the entire space in a smooth manner. This concept is particularly useful in the study of manifolds, where it helps in defining smooth functions, integrating over manifolds, and working with sheaves and cohomology.

### Definition

A partition of unity on a topological space \(X\) is a collection of continuous functions \(\{ \varphi_i \}_{i \in I}\) from \(X\) to \([0,1]\) such that:

1. **Locally Finite Cover**: Each point \(x \in X\) has a neighborhood that intersects only finitely many of the supports of the functions \(\varphi_i\). The support of \(\varphi_i\), denoted by \(\text{supp}(\varphi_i)\), is the closure of the set where \(\varphi_i\) is non-zero.
2. **Sum to One**: The functions \(\{ \varphi_i \}\) satisfy:
   $$
   \sum_{i \in I} \varphi_i(x) = 1 \quad \text{for all} \ x \in X.
   ```

### Properties

- **Subordinate to an Open Cover**: If \(\{ U_i \}_{i \in I}\) is an open cover of \(X\), the partition of unity \(\{ \varphi_i \}\) is said to be subordinate to this cover if each \(\text{supp}(\varphi_i)\) is contained in some \(U_i\).
- **Smooth Partition of Unity**: On a smooth manifold, a partition of unity can be chosen to consist of smooth functions.

### Existence

The existence of partitions of unity is guaranteed on paracompact spaces, which include all manifolds. This result is fundamental in [[differential topology]] and analysis.

### Construction

Here is an outline of how a partition of unity can be constructed:

1. **Open Cover and Locally Finite Refinement**: Start with an open cover \(\{ U_i \}_{i \in I}\) of a paracompact space \(X\). Find a locally finite open refinement \(\{ V_j \}_{j \in J}\) of this cover, such that each \(V_j\) is contained in some \(U_i\).
2. **Bump Functions**: Construct a smooth bump function \( \psi_j \) for each \( V_j \), such that \(\psi_j\) is non-negative and has support within \(V_j\).
3. **Normalization**: Define the functions \(\varphi_j\) by normalizing the bump functions:
   $$
   \varphi_j(x) = \frac{\psi_j(x)}{\sum_{k \in J} \psi_k(x)} \quad \text{for all} \ x \in X.
   ```

### Example: Partition of Unity on \(\mathbb{R}\)

Consider the open cover of \(\mathbb{R}\) given by \( U_n = (n-1, n+1) \) for \( n \in \mathbb{Z} \).

1. Define bump functions \(\psi_n: \mathbb{R} \to [0, 1]\) such that \(\psi_n(x)\) is 1 at \(x = n\) and smoothly tapers to 0 outside \((n-1, n+1)\).
2. Normalize these bump functions:
   $$
   \varphi_n(x) = \frac{\psi_n(x)}{\sum_{k \in \mathbb{Z}} \psi_k(x)}.
   $$
3. The resulting functions \(\{ \varphi_n \}\) form a partition of unity subordinate to the open cover \(\{ U_n \}\).

### Applications

1. **Smooth Functions on Manifolds**: Partitions of unity are used to extend locally defined smooth functions to the entire manifold, ensuring they remain smooth.
2. **Integration on Manifolds**: Used to define integrals of differential forms over manifolds by breaking the integral into locally manageable pieces.
3. **Sheaf Theory**: Partitions of unity help in the construction of global sections from local sections, a key concept in sheaf cohomology.
4. **Riemannian Geometry**: Used to construct global metrics from local data, ensuring the smoothness of the resulting metric.

### Conclusion

Partitions of unity are powerful tools in [[differential topology]] and analysis, enabling the construction of global objects from local data. They provide a way to smoothly extend functions, integrate over manifolds, and work with sheaves and cohomology. For further study, refer to [[Differential Topology]], [[Manifold Theory]], and [[Sheaf Theory]].
