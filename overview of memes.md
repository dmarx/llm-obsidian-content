### Overview of Memes

The term "meme" was first introduced by Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book *The Selfish Gene*. Dawkins coined the term to describe a unit of cultural transmission or imitation, analogous to the gene in biological evolution. In this context, a meme refers to an idea, behavior, or style that spreads from person to person within a culture. Much like genes, memes undergo variation, competition, and inheritance, influencing human behavior and cultural evolution.

### Formalization of Memes

A meme can be thought of as a pattern or a piece of information that is encoded in the human mind and replicated through communication or imitation. Memes manifest in various forms: images, phrases, symbols, gestures, or rituals, all of which are passed from one individual to another through social interaction.

Mathematically, memes can be modeled using frameworks from population dynamics and information theory. If we define a meme as a piece of information $m$ that spreads through a population $P$ over time $t$, the prevalence of a meme within the population can be modeled by differential equations similar to those used in epidemiology. For example:

$$
\frac{dM(t)}{dt} = \beta M(t) (N - M(t)) - \gamma M(t)
$$

Here:
- $M(t)$ represents the number of people in the population $P$ who have adopted the meme by time $t$.
- $N$ is the total population size.
- $\beta$ represents the transmission rate of the meme (analogous to infection rate in epidemiology).
- $\gamma$ represents the rate at which people forget the meme or cease to propagate it.

This is a simple model and can be extended by considering more complex factors like network topology, meme competition, and mutation (variation in the meme).

### Memes in Cultural Evolution

In the context of [[Cultural Evolution]], memes play a crucial role similar to that of genes in biological evolution. Cultural evolution refers to the process by which culture is transmitted, modified, and evolved over time. Memes are the building blocks of culture, influencing everything from language and art to social norms and technological practices.

- **Variation**: Memes can change or mutate as they are transmitted from one individual to another. For instance, a joke may evolve as it spreads, with different people adding their twist to it.
- **Selection**: Not all memes are equally successful; some are more "fit" in the cultural environment and therefore spread more widely. Selection pressures can include social relevance, humor, simplicity, or emotional impact.
- **Inheritance**: Memes are passed from one generation to another, often through [[Social Learning]]. This process can be vertical (from parent to child) or horizontal (among peers).

### Internet Memes

In contemporary usage, the term "meme" often refers to internet memes, a subset of memes that spread rapidly through online communities. Internet memes are typically humorous images, videos, or text that go viral across social media platforms. While the format of internet memes is specific to the digital age, they still follow the same principles of variation, selection, and inheritance.

### Mathematical Modelling of Internet Memes

The spread of internet memes can be analyzed using models similar to those used in [[Epidemiology]]. For instance, if $M(t)$ represents the number of people who have shared a meme at time $t$, a basic model might include:

$$
\frac{dM(t)}{dt} = \beta M(t) (N - M(t)) - \gamma M(t)
$$

Where $\beta$ is the transmission rate (how likely a person is to share the meme) and $\gamma$ is the rate of forgetting or losing interest in the meme.

In more complex models, factors such as the network structure of social media platforms, the meme's inherent appeal (virality factor), and external events can be included to predict how and why certain memes spread faster or become more influential.

### Conclusion

Memes are a fundamental concept in understanding cultural evolution, functioning as units of information that replicate and evolve through human interaction. Whether viewed through the lens of cultural transmission or internet virality, memes exhibit dynamics that can be mathematically modeled and analyzed to provide insight into their spread and impact.

### Memes as Patterns of Information

When we describe a meme as a "pattern or piece of information," we are acknowledging that memes are not tangible objects but rather abstract constructs that exist in the minds of individuals. These constructs can be encoded in various forms—images, phrases, behaviors, ideas, or even emotions—that people recognize, remember, and transmit to others. 

#### Encoding in the Human Mind

In cognitive terms, a meme is stored as a mental representation—a cognitive structure that encapsulates the essential features of the meme. This representation could be visual (such as the image of a popular meme template), auditory (like a catchy phrase or song), or conceptual (an idea or belief). The mental encoding of a meme involves processes like perception, attention, memory, and categorization.

For instance, consider the well-known internet meme format "Distracted Boyfriend." The pattern of this meme is not just the image itself but also the relationship between the elements within the image (the boyfriend looking at another woman while his girlfriend looks on in disapproval). This pattern is encoded in the viewer's mind as a recognizable template, which can then be applied to various contexts (e.g., labeling the characters with different concepts).

#### Replication through Communication and Imitation

Once a meme is encoded in an individual's mind, it becomes a candidate for replication. Replication can occur in two primary ways:

1. **Communication**: When a person shares a meme with others, they are essentially transmitting the encoded information from their mind to another person's mind. This transmission can occur through language, writing, visual media, or any other communicative medium. For example, when you share a meme on social media, you are enabling others to encode that same pattern in their minds.

2. **Imitation**: Imitation involves the direct copying of behavior or ideas from one individual to another. This is common in the replication of social behaviors, rituals, or fashions. For example, the "wave" at sports events is a meme that spreads through the crowd by imitation—people see others performing the action and replicate it themselves.

#### Stability and Mutation

For a meme to be successfully replicated, it must maintain a certain degree of stability—its essential features must be preserved during transmission. However, like genes, memes are also subject to mutation. Variations in the meme may arise due to errors in transmission, intentional modifications, or adaptation to different cultural contexts.

For example, a popular internet meme might be recontextualized or altered to fit new situations or to convey different meanings. These variations, if successful, may spread further, leading to the evolution of the meme.

### Cognitive and Cultural Dynamics

The replication of memes is driven by cognitive processes within individuals and cultural dynamics at the population level.

- **Cognitive Dynamics**: On the individual level, factors like memory retention, cognitive biases, and emotional impact play significant roles in determining which memes are successfully encoded and later transmitted. For example, a meme that elicits a strong emotional response (like humor or outrage) is more likely to be remembered and shared.

- **Cultural Dynamics**: At the cultural level, social networks, media platforms, and group behaviors influence the spread and evolution of memes. The meme's "fitness" in a cultural environment depends on how well it resonates with the values, norms, and interests of the community.

#### Memes and Information Theory

Memes can also be analyzed using the principles of information theory. In this framework, a meme is viewed as a piece of information $m$ that can be encoded into a message and transmitted through a communication channel to a receiver, who decodes it back into a mental representation.

- **Entropy**: The diversity of a meme's possible variants can be measured using entropy, which quantifies the uncertainty or variability of the meme's form. High entropy indicates a wide range of possible variations, while low entropy suggests a more stable, easily recognizable meme.

- **Transmission Fidelity**: The accuracy with which a meme is transmitted from one individual to another can be likened to the concept of transmission fidelity in information theory. High-fidelity transmission preserves the meme's original structure, whereas low fidelity leads to greater mutation or distortion.

### Conclusion

In summary, memes are patterns of information that are encoded in the human mind, where they exist as mental representations that guide behavior, communication, and cultural evolution. Their replication through communication and imitation, combined with cognitive and cultural dynamics, drives the spread and evolution of these memes. This understanding links the concept of memes to broader frameworks like information theory and cognitive science, providing a rich basis for exploring how ideas and behaviors propagate within societies.
