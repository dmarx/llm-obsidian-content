# Nakajima-Zwanzig Equation

The Nakajima-Zwanzig equation is a fundamental mathematical framework in [[non-equilibrium statistical mechanics]] that provides a formal approach to deriving reduced dynamical descriptions for complex many-body systems. Developed independently by [[Sadao Nakajima]] and [[Robert Zwanzig]] in the early 1960s, it offers a rigorous method for projecting the full dynamics of a system onto a subset of relevant degrees of freedom while accounting for the influence of the remaining degrees of freedom through memory effects and noise terms.

## Mathematical Foundation

### Projection Operator Formalism

The Nakajima-Zwanzig equation relies on the concept of [[projection operators]] to separate the relevant from irrelevant parts of a system's dynamics:

$$\mathcal{P} + \mathcal{Q} = \mathcal{I}$$

Where:
- $\mathcal{P}$ is the projection operator onto the relevant subspace
- $\mathcal{Q} = \mathcal{I} - \mathcal{P}$ is the complementary projection onto the irrelevant subspace
- $\mathcal{I}$ is the identity operator

A common choice for the projection operator in quantum statistical mechanics is:

$$\mathcal{P}\rho = \rho_B \otimes \text{Tr}_B(\rho)$$

Where:
- $\rho$ is the total [[density matrix]]
- $\rho_B$ is the reference state of the bath (often thermal equilibrium)
- $\text{Tr}_B$ denotes the partial trace over the bath degrees of freedom

### Derivation of the Equation

Starting from the [[Liouville-von Neumann equation]] for the density matrix:

$$\frac{d\rho}{dt} = -\frac{i}{\hbar}[H, \rho] \equiv \mathcal{L}\rho$$

Where $\mathcal{L}$ is the [[Liouville superoperator]], the Nakajima-Zwanzig equation is derived by separating the dynamics into relevant ($\mathcal{P}\rho$) and irrelevant ($\mathcal{Q}\rho$) components:

$$\frac{d}{dt}\mathcal{P}\rho(t) = \mathcal{P}\mathcal{L}\mathcal{P}\rho(t) + \mathcal{P}\mathcal{L}e^{\mathcal{Q}\mathcal{L}t}\mathcal{Q}\rho(0) + \int_0^t ds \, \mathcal{P}\mathcal{L}e^{\mathcal{Q}\mathcal{L}(t-s)}\mathcal{Q}\mathcal{L}\mathcal{P}\rho(s)$$

This integro-differential equation is the Nakajima-Zwanzig equation, which decomposes the dynamics into three distinct terms:

1. **[[Markovian term]]**: $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{L}\mathcal{P}\rho(t)$ - describes the direct influence of the relevant subspace on itself
2. **[[Inhomogeneous term]]**: $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{L}e^{\mathcal{Q}\mathcal{L}t}\mathcal{Q}\rho(0)$ - represents the effect of initial correlations between relevant and irrelevant variables
3. **[[Memory term]]**: $\int_0^t ds \, \mathcal{P}\mathcal{L}e^{\mathcal{Q}\mathcal{L}(t-s)}\mathcal{Q}\mathcal{L}\mathcal{P}\rho(s)$ - accounts for the history-dependent influence of the irrelevant variables

### Time-Convolutionless Form

The [[Time-Convolutionless]] (TCL) version of the Nakajima-Zwanzig equation eliminates the time-convolution integral:

$$\frac{d}{dt}\mathcal{P}\rho(t) = \mathcal{K}(t)\mathcal{P}\rho(t) + \mathcal{I}(t)$$

Where $\mathcal{K}(t)$ is a time-dependent superoperator and $\mathcal{I}(t)$ is an inhomogeneous term. This form is often more tractable for numerical implementation.

## Relation to Other Formalisms

### Comparison with Mori-Zwanzig Formalism

The Nakajima-Zwanzig equation is closely related to the [[Mori-Zwanzig formalism]], with key differences:

1. **Domain of application**: Nakajima-Zwanzig primarily works with density operators in quantum systems, while Mori-Zwanzig traditionally applies to classical observables
2. **Projection choice**: Nakajima-Zwanzig typically uses projections onto reduced density matrices, while Mori-Zwanzig often uses projections onto linear spaces of observables
3. **Mathematical structure**: Despite these differences, both formalisms yield similar integro-differential equations with memory kernels

### Connection to Quantum Master Equations

The Nakajima-Zwanzig equation provides a foundation for deriving various [[quantum master equations]]:

1. **[[Redfield equation]]**: Derived under the [[Born-Markov approximation]]
2. **[[Lindblad equation]]**: Obtained with additional secular approximation to ensure complete positivity
3. **[[Quantum Fokker-Planck equation]]**: Applicable to quantum Brownian motion

### Relation to Classical Transport Equations

Through appropriate limits, the Nakajima-Zwanzig equation connects to classical transport theories:

1. **[[Boltzmann equation]]**: Emerges in the classical limit with specific projection choices
2. **[[Langevin equations]]**: Can be derived for particular system-bath models
3. **[[Generalized Langevin Equation]]**: Classical analog with memory kernels

## Approximation Methods

### Born Approximation

The [[Born approximation]] assumes weak system-bath coupling, allowing the factorization:

$$\rho(t) \approx \rho_S(t) \otimes \rho_B$$

Where $\rho_S(t) = \text{Tr}_B(\rho(t))$ is the reduced system density matrix.

### Markov Approximation

The [[Markov approximation]] assumes the bath correlation functions decay rapidly compared to the system dynamics, leading to:

$$\int_0^t ds \, \mathcal{P}\mathcal{L}e^{\mathcal{Q}\mathcal{L}(t-s)}\mathcal{Q}\mathcal{L}\mathcal{P}\rho(s) \approx \int_0^\infty ds \, \mathcal{P}\mathcal{L}e^{\mathcal{Q}\mathcal{L}s}\mathcal{Q}\mathcal{L}\mathcal{P}\rho(t)$$

This transforms the integro-differential equation into a differential equation.

### Perturbative Expansions

Various [[perturbative expansions]] of the memory kernel can be employed:

1. **[[Dyson series]]**: Expansion in powers of the interaction Hamiltonian
2. **[[Cumulant expansion]]**: Systematic treatment of correlation functions
3. **[[TCL expansion]]**: Perturbative approach to the time-convolutionless form

### Projection Operator Choices

Different projection operators lead to different reduced descriptions:

1. **[[Argyres-Kelley projection]]**: Projects onto diagonal elements of the density matrix
2. **[[Correlated projection operators]]**: Include certain system-bath correlations
3. **[[Time-dependent projections]]**: Adapt the relevant subspace as the system evolves
