Martingale Representation Theorem

### Martingale Representation Theorem

The **Martingale Representation Theorem** is a fundamental result in stochastic calculus which states that any martingale can be represented as a stochastic integral with respect to a Brownian motion. This theorem is crucial in the theory of financial mathematics, particularly in the context of hedging and pricing derivatives.

### Statement of the Martingale Representation Theorem

Let \( W_t \) be a standard Brownian motion on a probability space \( (\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P) \) with a filtration \( \{ \mathcal{F}_t \} \) satisfying the usual conditions (right-continuity and completeness). If \( M_t \) is a square-integrable martingale with respect to \( \{ \mathcal{F}_t \} \), then there exists a unique predictable process \( \phi_t \) such that:

$$
M_t = M_0 + \int_0^t \phi_s \, dW_s,
$$

where \( \phi_t \) is an \( \mathcal{F}_t \)-adapted process and the stochastic integral \( \int_0^t \phi_s \, dW_s \) is well-defined.

### Interpretation

The theorem states that every square-integrable martingale can be decomposed into a deterministic initial value and a stochastic integral with respect to a Brownian motion. This representation is unique, and the integrand \( \phi_t \) can be interpreted as the sensitivity of the martingale to the Brownian motion.

### Proof Sketch

A full proof of the Martingale Representation Theorem is quite technical, but here is a sketch of the main ideas:

1. **Step 1: Construction of the Integrand**: The goal is to construct a predictable process \( \phi_t \) such that \( M_t \) can be written as \( M_t = M_0 + \int_0^t \phi_s \, dW_s \).

2. **Step 2: Orthogonal Projection**: The process \( M_t \) can be approximated by simple processes, and we can use the orthogonal projection theorem in Hilbert spaces to find the best approximation in terms of \( W_t \).

3. **Step 3: Limit and Uniqueness**: By taking limits of these approximations, we can show the existence of \( \phi_t \) and establish the uniqueness of the representation.

### Applications in Finance

#### 1. **Hedging**

The Martingale Representation Theorem is fundamental in hedging theory. In the context of financial markets, it implies that any contingent claim (payoff) that is a martingale can be replicated by a dynamic trading strategy involving the underlying asset and the risk-free asset.

#### 2. **Pricing**

In risk-neutral pricing, the price of a derivative is often expressed as an expectation under a risk-neutral measure. The Martingale Representation Theorem ensures that the price process can be represented in terms of the underlying asset price process.

### Example: Derivation of the Black-Scholes Formula

Consider a European call option with payoff \( (S_T - K)^+ \) at maturity \( T \). Under the risk-neutral measure \( Q \), the discounted stock price process \( \hat{S}_t = e^{-rt} S_t \) is a martingale.

1. **Representation**: By the Martingale Representation Theorem, there exists a process \( \phi_t \) such that:
   \[
   \hat{S}_t = S_0 + \int_0^t \phi_s \, dW_s^Q.
   \]

2. **Pricing Formula**: The price of the European call option at time \( t \) is given by:
   \[
   C(S_t, t) = e^{-r(T-t)} E^Q \left[ (S_T - K)^+ \mid \mathcal{F}_t \right].
   \]

3. **Delta Hedging**: The process \( \phi_t \) represents the delta of the option, i.e., the sensitivity of the option price to the underlying asset price.

### Detailed Example

Consider a simple martingale \( M_t \) under the filtration generated by a Brownian motion \( W_t \):

$$
M_t = \int_0^t \theta_s \, dW_s,
$$

where \( \theta_t \) is a predictable process. According to the Martingale Representation Theorem, if \( M_t \) is a martingale, there exists a process \( \phi_t \) such that:

$$
M_t = M_0 + \int_0^t \phi_s \, dW_s.
$$

If \( M_t \) is already in the form of a stochastic integral, then \( \phi_t = \theta_t \).

### Conclusion

The Martingale Representation Theorem is a cornerstone of modern stochastic calculus and financial mathematics. It ensures that any martingale can be expressed as a stochastic integral with respect to a Brownian motion, providing a powerful tool for the analysis and implementation of hedging strategies and derivative pricing. This theorem underpins many key results and techniques in financial engineering, making it essential for anyone working in the field of quantitative finance.
