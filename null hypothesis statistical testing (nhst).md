## Null Hypothesis Statistical Testing (NHST)

### Introduction

Null Hypothesis Statistical Testing (NHST) is a framework used in statistics to make inferences about population parameters based on sample data. It provides a structured methodology for testing whether there is enough evidence to reject a null hypothesis in favor of an alternative hypothesis. NHST is widely used in various scientific fields to validate experimental results and draw conclusions about the effects observed in studies.

### Key Concepts

1. **Null Hypothesis (\(H_0\))**: The null hypothesis is a statement that there is no effect or no difference in the population. It serves as the default or starting assumption in NHST.
   - Example: In a clinical trial testing a new drug, \(H_0\) might state that the drug has no effect on the disease.

2. **Alternative Hypothesis (\(H_1\))**: The alternative hypothesis is a statement that there is an effect or a difference in the population. It represents what the researcher aims to support.
   - Example: In the same clinical trial, \(H_1\) might state that the drug does have an effect on the disease.

3. **Test Statistic**: A test statistic is a standardized value calculated from sample data during a hypothesis test. It is used to determine whether to reject the null hypothesis.
   - Example: Common test statistics include the \(t\)-statistic, \(z\)-statistic, and \(\chi^2\)-statistic.

4. **P-value**: The p-value is the probability of obtaining a test statistic at least as extreme as the one observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true. A low p-value indicates that the observed data is unlikely under the null hypothesis.
   - Conventional thresholds: 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001.

5. **Significance Level (\(\alpha\))**: The significance level is a pre-determined threshold for deciding whether to reject the null hypothesis. It represents the probability of making a Type I error (false positive).
   - Example: A common significance level is \(\alpha = 0.05\).

6. **Type I and Type II Errors**:
   - **Type I Error**: Rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true.
   - **Type II Error**: Failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is false.

### Steps in NHST

1. **State the Hypotheses**: Formulate the null and alternative hypotheses.
   - \(H_0\): The mean difference between groups is zero.
   - \(H_1\): The mean difference between groups is not zero.

2. **Choose the Significance Level**: Select a significance level (\(\alpha\)), such as 0.05.

3. **Collect Data**: Gather sample data through experiments or observations.

4. **Calculate the Test Statistic**: Use the appropriate statistical test to compute the test statistic based on the sample data.

5. **Determine the P-value**: Find the p-value corresponding to the test statistic.

6. **Make a Decision**: Compare the p-value to the significance level (\(\alpha\)):
   - If \(p \leq \alpha\), reject \(H_0\).
   - If \(p > \alpha\), fail to reject \(H_0\).

### Example: Two-Sample \(t\)-Test

#### Scenario

Suppose researchers want to compare the effectiveness of two teaching methods on students' test scores. They collect scores from two independent samples of students, one using Method A and the other using Method B.

#### Steps

1. **State the Hypotheses**:
   - \(H_0\): \(\mu_A = \mu_B\) (The means of the two groups are equal.)
   - \(H_1\): \(\mu_A \neq \mu_B\) (The means of the two groups are not equal.)

2. **Choose the Significance Level**: \(\alpha = 0.05\).

3. **Collect Data**: 
   - Sample A: \(n_A = 30\), \(\bar{X}_A = 75\), \(s_A = 10\).
   - Sample B: \(n_B = 30\), \(\bar{X}_B = 80\), \(s_B = 12\).

4. **Calculate the Test Statistic**:
   - Use the two-sample \(t\)-test formula:
     $$
     t = \frac{\bar{X}_A - \bar{X}_B}{\sqrt{\frac{s_A^2}{n_A} + \frac{s_B^2}{n_B}}}
     $$
     Substituting the values:
     $$
     t = \frac{75 - 80}{\sqrt{\frac{10^2}{30} + \frac{12^2}{30}}} = \frac{-5}{\sqrt{\frac{100}{30} + \frac{144}{30}}} = \frac{-5}{\sqrt{8.13}} = \frac{-5}{2.85} \approx -1.75
     $$

5. **Determine the P-value**:
   - Use a \(t\)-distribution table or software to find the p-value for \(t = -1.75\) with \(df = 58\) (assuming equal variances and using \(df = n_A + n_B - 2\)).
   - P-value â‰ˆ 0.085 (two-tailed).

6. **Make a Decision**:
   - Since the p-value (0.085) > \(\alpha\) (0.05), we fail to reject \(H_0\).
   - Conclusion: There is not enough evidence to suggest a significant difference in mean test scores between the two teaching methods at the 0.05 significance level.

### Conclusion

Null Hypothesis Statistical Testing is a fundamental tool in inferential statistics, providing a systematic approach to testing hypotheses and making data-driven decisions. By comparing the p-value to a pre-determined significance level, researchers can determine whether to reject the null hypothesis and infer the presence of an effect or difference.
