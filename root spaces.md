### Root Spaces

Root spaces are a fundamental concept in the structure theory of semisimple Lie algebras. They arise from the decomposition of a Lie algebra relative to a chosen Cartan subalgebra. This decomposition helps in understanding the algebra's structure and in classifying its representations.

### Definitions

#### Cartan Subalgebra

A **Cartan subalgebra** $\mathfrak{h}$ of a Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ is a maximal abelian subalgebra where all elements are simultaneously diagonalizable over the complex numbers. For a semisimple Lie algebra, a Cartan subalgebra is also nilpotent and often used to facilitate the decomposition of $\mathfrak{g}$.

#### Roots

Given a Cartan subalgebra $\mathfrak{h}$ of a semisimple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, a **root** $\alpha$ is a linear functional in the dual space $\mathfrak{h}^*$ such that there exists a non-zero element $X \in \mathfrak{g}$ satisfying:
$$ [H, X] = \alpha(H)X \quad \text{for all } H \in \mathfrak{h}. $$
The set of all roots is denoted by $\Delta$.

#### Root Space

For each root $\alpha \in \Delta$, the **root space** $\mathfrak{g}_\alpha$ is defined as:
$$ \mathfrak{g}_\alpha = \{ X \in \mathfrak{g} \mid [H, X] = \alpha(H)X \text{ for all } H \in \mathfrak{h} \}. $$

### Properties

1. **Dimensionality**: Each root space $\mathfrak{g}_\alpha$ is a vector space. For semisimple Lie algebras, $\mathfrak{g}_\alpha$ is typically one-dimensional.
2. **Direct Sum Decomposition**: The Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ decomposes into a direct sum of the Cartan subalgebra $\mathfrak{h}$ and the root spaces $\mathfrak{g}_\alpha$:
   $$ \mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{h} \oplus \bigoplus_{\alpha \in \Delta} \mathfrak{g}_\alpha. $$
3. **Commutation Relations**: The commutation relations between elements in different root spaces are given by:
   $$ [\mathfrak{g}_\alpha, \mathfrak{g}_\beta] \subseteq \mathfrak{g}_{\alpha + \beta}, $$
   where $\mathfrak{g}_{\alpha + \beta}$ is the root space corresponding to the root $\alpha + \beta$, if $\alpha + \beta$ is a root. If $\alpha + \beta$ is not a root, then the commutator is zero.

### Example

Consider the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbb{C})$, which consists of all $2 \times 2$ complex matrices with trace zero. A Cartan subalgebra $\mathfrak{h}$ can be taken as the span of the diagonal matrix $H = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}$. The roots are $\alpha(H) = 2$ and $-\alpha(H) = -2$.

The corresponding root spaces are:
$$ \mathfrak{g}_{\alpha} = \text{span} \left\{ E = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \right\}, \quad \mathfrak{g}_{-\alpha} = \text{span} \left\{ F = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \right\}. $$

### Root System

The set of all roots $\Delta$ forms a **root system**, which satisfies the following properties:
1. **Symmetry**: If $\alpha \in \Delta$, then $-\alpha \in \Delta$.
2. **Reflection**: For any root $\alpha$, the reflection $\sigma_\alpha$ defined by
   $$ \sigma_\alpha(\beta) = \beta - 2\frac{(\beta, \alpha)}{(\alpha, \alpha)}\alpha $$
   maps roots to roots, where $(\cdot, \cdot)$ is a bilinear form on $\mathfrak{h}^*$.

### Applications

#### Structure and Classification

Root spaces and root systems are crucial in the classification of semisimple Lie algebras. The Cartan classification uses the structure of the root system to classify these algebras into distinct types (e.g., $A_n$, $B_n$, $C_n$, $D_n$).

#### Representation Theory

In representation theory, weights play a similar role to roots. Weights are eigenvalues of the Cartan subalgebra acting on a representation space, and the corresponding weight spaces decompose the representation into simpler components.
