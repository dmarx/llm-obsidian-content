Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) Model

### Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) Model

The Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) model is a fundamental [[inventory management]] tool used to determine the optimal order quantity that minimizes the total inventory costs. These costs typically include ordering costs, holding costs, and stockout costs. By finding the optimal order quantity, businesses can achieve cost efficiency and effective inventory control.

#### Key Concepts

1. **Ordering Costs**: The costs associated with placing and receiving an order, including administrative expenses, transportation, and handling costs.
2. **Holding Costs**: The costs of holding inventory over time, including warehousing, insurance, and opportunity costs of capital.
3. **Stockout Costs**: The costs incurred when inventory is insufficient to meet demand, such as lost sales, backorder costs, and customer dissatisfaction.

#### EOQ Formula

The EOQ model calculates the optimal order quantity by balancing ordering and holding costs. The basic EOQ formula is:
$$
EOQ = \sqrt{\frac{2DS}{H}}
$$
where:
- \( D \) = Annual demand (units)
- \( S \) = Ordering cost per order
- \( H \) = Holding cost per unit per year

#### Components of EOQ

1. **Annual Demand (D)**: The total quantity of units required per year.
2. **Ordering Cost (S)**: The fixed cost incurred every time an order is placed, regardless of the order size.
3. **Holding Cost (H)**: The cost to hold one unit of inventory for one year, including storage, insurance, and capital costs.

#### Derivation of EOQ

The EOQ formula is derived from the total cost function, which includes ordering and holding costs.

1. **Total Ordering Cost (TOC)**:
$$
TOC = \frac{D}{Q} \times S
$$
where \( Q \) is the order quantity.

2. **Total Holding Cost (THC)**:
$$
THC = \frac{Q}{2} \times H
$$

3. **Total Cost (TC)**: The sum of ordering and holding costs.
$$
TC = TOC + THC = \frac{D}{Q} \times S + \frac{Q}{2} \times H
$$

To find the EOQ, take the derivative of \( TC \) with respect to \( Q \) and set it to zero:
$$
\frac{d(TC)}{dQ} = -\frac{DS}{Q^2} + \frac{H}{2} = 0
$$
Solve for \( Q \):
$$
Q^2 = \frac{2DS}{H}
$$
$$
Q = \sqrt{\frac{2DS}{H}}
$$

Thus, the EOQ is:
$$
EOQ = \sqrt{\frac{2DS}{H}}
$$

#### Example Calculation

Suppose a company has the following data:
- Annual demand (\( D \)) = 10,000 units
- Ordering cost (\( S \)) = \$50 per order
- Holding cost (\( H \)) = \$2 per unit per year

Plugging these values into the EOQ formula:
$$
EOQ = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 10000 \times 50}{2}} = \sqrt{500000} \approx 707 \text{ units}
$$

The optimal order quantity is approximately 707 units.

#### Advanced Considerations

1. **Reorder Point (ROP)**: The inventory level at which a new order should be placed to avoid stockouts. It can be calculated as:
$$
ROP = d \times L
$$
where \( d \) is the average daily demand and \( L \) is the [[lead time]] in days.

2. **Quantity Discounts**: When suppliers offer discounts for larger order quantities, the EOQ model can be adjusted to incorporate the price breaks. The total cost function is modified to include the discounted price.

3. **Safety Stock**: Additional inventory held to protect against variability in demand and [[lead time]]. The EOQ model can incorporate safety stock by adjusting the reorder point.

4. **Multiple Products**: In practice, companies often manage multiple products. The EOQ model can be extended to consider the interactions between products, such as shared storage space and budget constraints.

5. **Stochastic Demand**: When demand is uncertain, probabilistic models are used to determine the EOQ, considering the distribution of demand.

#### Conclusion

The EOQ model is a powerful tool for optimizing [[inventory management]] by minimizing the total costs associated with ordering and holding inventory. By understanding the components and derivation of the EOQ formula, businesses can effectively manage their inventory levels, reduce costs, and improve overall efficiency. Advanced considerations such as reorder points, quantity discounts, safety stock, and stochastic demand further enhance the model's applicability in real-world scenarios.
