### Lyapunov Stability Theory

Lyapunov stability theory is a fundamental mathematical framework used to analyze the stability of dynamic systems. Named after the Russian mathematician Aleksandr Lyapunov, this theory provides tools for determining whether the state of a dynamic system remains close to an equilibrium point over time.

### Key Concepts

1. **Equilibrium Point**: A state \( x^* \) is an equilibrium point of a dynamic system if, when the system is in this state, it remains there indefinitely, i.e., \( \dot{x}(t) = 0 \) when \( x(t) = x^* \).
2. **Stability**: An equilibrium point is stable if small perturbations in the initial conditions result in system states that remain close to the equilibrium point.
3. **Asymptotic Stability**: An equilibrium point is asymptotically stable if it is stable, and if perturbations not only remain close but also tend to the equilibrium point as time goes to infinity.
4. **Lyapunov Function**: A scalar function \( V(x) \) that provides a measure of system energy or distance from the equilibrium point. It is used to assess stability.

### Lyapunov's Direct Method

Lyapunov's direct method involves finding a suitable Lyapunov function to prove stability. The method does not require solving the differential equations describing the system's dynamics.

#### Lyapunov Function

A function \( V: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R} \) is called a Lyapunov function for the system \( \dot{x} = f(x) \) if it satisfies the following conditions:
1. \( V(x) \) is positive definite: \( V(x) > 0 \) for all \( x \neq 0 \) and \( V(0) = 0 \).
2. The time derivative \( \dot{V}(x) = \frac{dV(x)}{dt} = \nabla V \cdot f(x) \) is negative semi-definite: \( \dot{V}(x) \leq 0 \) for all \( x \neq 0 \).

#### Stability Criteria

- **Stable**: The equilibrium point \( x = 0 \) is stable if there exists a Lyapunov function \( V(x) \) such that \( V(x) \) is positive definite and \( \dot{V}(x) \) is negative semi-definite.
- **Asymptotically Stable**: The equilibrium point \( x = 0 \) is asymptotically stable if there exists a Lyapunov function \( V(x) \) such that \( V(x) \) is positive definite and \( \dot{V}(x) \) is negative definite.
- **Globally Asymptotically Stable**: The equilibrium point \( x = 0 \) is globally asymptotically stable if \( V(x) \) is radially unbounded (i.e., \( V(x) \to \infty \) as \( \|x\| \to \infty \)) and \( \dot{V}(x) \) is negative definite.

### Example: Stability of a Linear System

Consider a linear system:
$$
\dot{x} = Ax,
$$
where \( A \) is a constant matrix.

#### Lyapunov Function for Linear Systems

A common Lyapunov function candidate for linear systems is:
$$
V(x) = x^T P x,
$$
where \( P \) is a positive definite matrix. The time derivative of \( V \) along the trajectories of the system is:
$$
\dot{V}(x) = \frac{d}{dt}(x^T P x) = x^T (A^T P + P A) x.
$$

To ensure stability, choose \( P \) such that \( A^T P + P A \) is negative definite. This can be done by solving the Lyapunov equation:
$$
A^T P + P A = -Q,
$$
where \( Q \) is a given positive definite matrix. If such a \( P \) exists, then \( V(x) = x^T P x \) is a valid Lyapunov function, and the equilibrium point \( x = 0 \) is asymptotically stable.

### Example: Nonlinear System

Consider a nonlinear system:
$$
\dot{x}_1 = x_2, \\
\dot{x}_2 = -x_1 - x_2 + x_1^3.
$$

#### Lyapunov Function

A candidate Lyapunov function for this system could be:
$$
V(x) = \frac{1}{2} (x_1^2 + x_2^2).
$$

The time derivative of \( V \) along the system's trajectories is:
$$
\dot{V}(x) = x_1 \dot{x}_1 + x_2 \dot{x}_2 = x_1 x_2 + x_2 (-x_1 - x_2 + x_1^3) = x_1 x_2 - x_1 x_2 - x_2^2 + x_1^3 x_2.
$$

Simplifying, we get:
$$
\dot{V}(x) = -x_2^2 + x_1^3 x_2.
$$

For small \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \), \( -x_2^2 \) dominates \( x_1^3 x_2 \), making \( \dot{V}(x) \leq 0 \). Hence, \( V(x) \) is a valid Lyapunov function, indicating the system is stable around the origin.

### Conclusion

Lyapunov stability theory provides powerful tools for analyzing the stability of dynamic systems without solving the differential equations explicitly. By constructing an appropriate Lyapunov function, one can determine whether an equilibrium point is stable, asymptotically stable, or globally asymptotically stable. This theory is fundamental in control engineering, especially in the design and analysis of adaptive and robust control systems.
