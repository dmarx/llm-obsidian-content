### **Training Custom LoRA with Hugging Face: Overview of Common LLM Training Data Formats**

In this assignment, we will explore two key aspects of working with **large language models (LLMs)**:
1. **Common LLM Training Data Formats**: Understanding the structure of the datasets typically used to train large language models (LLMs).
2. **Training a Custom LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) Model**: Using the **Hugging Face** ecosystem, we’ll walk through training a custom LoRA model to fine-tune an LLM for a specific task.

### **Part 1: Common LLM Training Data Formats**

Before training an LLM or fine-tuning one with techniques like **LoRA**, we must understand the common data formats used to train such models. Most LLMs are trained on large corpora of text, often in **structured** or **semi-structured** formats, ensuring compatibility with various tasks like language modeling, instruction-following, and dialogue generation.

#### **1. Text-Based Formats**
The most straightforward and widely used format for LLM training is raw text. This format is typically used for unsupervised training where the model learns patterns in the text itself without explicit labels.

- **Plain Text**: Raw text files (.txt) where sentences and paragraphs are just lines of text.
  
  **Example**:
  ```
  The capital of France is Paris.
  AI is transforming various industries by automating tasks.
  ```
  
- **Tokenized Text**: Text that is tokenized and stored in a format like **JSON** where each token is represented by its index in the model's vocabulary.

  **Example (Tokenized JSON)**:
  ```json
  {
    "text": [1234, 5678, 91011, 1213]
  }
  ```

#### **2. JSON-Based Instructional Data**
For models fine-tuned to follow instructions or chat models, JSON-like formats are often used to provide more structured examples. This data is highly structured and often contains **prompts** and **responses** for supervised training, especially for instruction-tuned models like **InstructGPT**.

- **Instruction Data Format (JSON)**: This format is used to structure tasks, queries, or instructions, followed by an expected model response.

  **Example (Instruction Tuning Format)**:
  ```json
  [
    {
      "instruction": "Translate the following sentence to French.",
      "input": "The weather is nice today.",
      "output": "Il fait beau aujourd'hui."
    },
    {
      "instruction": "Summarize the following paragraph.",
      "input": "The stock market has been volatile in recent months due to uncertainties in global trade.",
      "output": "Global trade uncertainties have caused stock market volatility."
    }
  ]
  ```

#### **3. Dialogue Data Formats**
For models that engage in dialogue (like chat models), training data often consists of structured conversations where each message has a specific **role** (e.g., user, assistant, system).

- **Chat-Based JSON Format**: Each conversation includes a sequence of messages, each with a role indicating who is speaking and the content of the message.

  **Example (Chat Format)**:
  ```json
  [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "You are a helpful assistant."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "What's the capital of Italy?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "The capital of Italy is Rome."
    }
  ]
  ```

#### **4. Fine-Tuning Data Formats (Supervised Data)**
For specific tasks, like text classification or sequence-to-sequence models, datasets can include labels or target outputs in addition to the text input.

- **Supervised Text Data (CSV/JSON)**: Each row in the dataset corresponds to an input-output pair for supervised fine-tuning tasks such as translation, summarization, or classification.

  **Example (CSV for Text Classification)**:
  ```csv
  input_text, label
  "The product is excellent.", "positive"
  "The service was terrible.", "negative"
  ```

### **Part 2: Training a Custom LoRA Model Using the Hugging Face Ecosystem**

**LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** is a technique for fine-tuning large models by freezing most of the model's parameters and injecting trainable low-rank matrices. This greatly reduces the computational and memory costs, making it possible to fine-tune large models on smaller devices.

In this part, we’ll go through the steps for fine-tuning a pre-trained model using **LoRA** with the Hugging Face ecosystem.

#### **Step 1: Install the Required Libraries**
First, we need to install Hugging Face's **Transformers**, **Accelerate**, and **PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning)** libraries.

```bash
pip install transformers datasets accelerate peft
```

#### **Step 2: Load the Pre-Trained Model**
We’ll load a pre-trained model from the Hugging Face model hub. For this example, we’ll use **GPT-2**, but LoRA can be applied to any large model (e.g., GPT-3, T5, BERT).

```python
from transformers import GPT2Tokenizer, GPT2Model

# Load pre-trained model and tokenizer
model_name = "gpt2"
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = GPT2Model.from_pretrained(model_name)
```

#### **Step 3: Prepare the Dataset**
We will prepare a small dataset for fine-tuning. This can be loaded from Hugging Face's **datasets** library or custom JSON data that matches a format like instruction-based data.

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

# Load a dataset from Hugging Face datasets (e.g., for fine-tuning)
dataset = load_dataset("tatsu-lab/alpaca")  # Example of an instruction-tuning dataset
```

For custom datasets, you can load your own JSON/CSV data:

```python
import json

# Load your custom dataset from JSON
with open("custom_dataset.json", "r") as file:
    custom_data = json.load(file)
```

#### **Step 4: Apply LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) to the Model**
Using the **PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning)** library, we can apply LoRA to the model. This involves adding small trainable matrices to the attention layers of the pre-trained model.

```python
from peft import LoraConfig, get_peft_model

# Define the LoRA configuration
lora_config = LoraConfig(
    r=8,  # Rank of the low-rank approximation
    lora_alpha=32,  # Scaling factor for LoRA layers
    lora_dropout=0.1,  # Dropout for the LoRA layers
    target_modules=["q_proj", "v_proj"],  # Target the attention projection layers
    bias="none"
)

# Apply LoRA to the model
lora_model = get_peft_model(model, lora_config)
```

#### **Step 5: Fine-Tune the Model with LoRA**
Now we fine-tune the LoRA model using **Hugging Face’s Trainer API**. We first tokenize the dataset, then use the trainer to run the fine-tuning process.

```python
from transformers import TrainingArguments, Trainer

# Tokenize the dataset
def tokenize_function(examples):
    return tokenizer(examples['instruction'], truncation=True, padding='max_length')

tokenized_datasets = dataset.map(tokenize_function, batched=True)

# Set up training arguments
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./lora-finetuned-gpt2",
    per_device_train_batch_size=8,
    num_train_epochs=3,
    logging_dir="./logs",
    save_total_limit=1,
    save_steps=1000,
)

# Initialize the Trainer
trainer = Trainer(
    model=lora_model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=tokenized_datasets["train"],
    eval_dataset=tokenized_datasets["validation"],
)

# Fine-tune the model
trainer.train()
```

#### **Step 6: Save the Fine-Tuned Model**
After fine-tuning, the final model can be saved and uploaded back to the Hugging Face hub or used locally.

```python
# Save the LoRA fine-tuned model
lora_model.save_pretrained("./lora-finetuned-gpt2")

# Optionally, push the model to the Hugging Face hub
lora_model.push_to_hub("my-lora-finetuned-gpt2")
```

---

### **Step 7: Evaluating the Fine-Tuned LoRA Model**

Once the model is fine-tuned, you can evaluate it by passing new instructions or prompts.

```python
# Generate a response using the fine-tuned LoRA model
input_text = "Explain the importance of renewable energy."
input_ids = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt").input_ids

# Generate the model's output
output = lora_model.generate(input_ids, max_length=100)
generated_text = tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
print(generated_text)
```

### **Advantages of LoRA**

1. **Efficient Fine-Tuning**: LoRA reduces the number of trainable parameters, making it possible to fine-tune large models using limited computational resources.
2. **Task Specialization**: By fine-tuning only small, low-rank matrices, you can specialize a large language model for a specific task without retraining the entire model.
3. **Resource Efficiency**: LoRA requires less GPU memory compared to full model fine-tuning, making
