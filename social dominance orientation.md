## Social Dominance Orientation

### Introduction

[[Social Dominance Orientation]] (SDO) is a personality trait reflecting an individual's preference for hierarchy within any social system and the domination of lower-status groups by higher-status groups. It plays a central role in [[Social Dominance Theory]] (SDT), which explains how and why group-based social hierarchies are established and maintained.

### Conceptual Framework

SDO is conceptualized as a continuum, with high SDO individuals favoring strong group hierarchies and endorsing beliefs and policies that maintain social inequality. Conversely, low SDO individuals prefer more egalitarian structures and support policies that reduce social inequality.

### Measurement

SDO is typically measured using the Social Dominance Orientation Scale, which consists of statements to which respondents indicate their level of agreement or disagreement on a Likert scale. The scale items are designed to capture the extent to which an individual endorses group-based hierarchy and dominance.

Example items from the SDO scale include:
- "Some groups of people are just more deserving than others."
- "It's probably a good thing that certain groups are at the top and other groups are at the bottom."
- "No one group should dominate in society" (reverse-scored).

The overall SDO score is calculated as:

$$
SDO = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i}{n}
$$

where \( X_i \) represents the score for each item, and \( n \) is the total number of items.

### Dimensions of SDO

Recent research suggests that SDO comprises two distinct but related dimensions:
1. **SDO-Dominance (SDO-D)**: This dimension reflects a desire for active oppression and dominance over lower-status groups.
2. **SDO-Egalitarianism (SDO-E)**: This dimension reflects opposition to equality and support for maintaining group-based inequality.

### Psychological and Behavioral Correlates

#### Attitudes and Beliefs

High SDO is associated with:
- Endorsement of hierarchy-enhancing ideologies (e.g., meritocracy, social Darwinism).
- Prejudicial attitudes toward out-groups.
- Support for policies that sustain social inequality (e.g., harsher criminal justice policies, reduced welfare spending).

Low SDO is associated with:
- Endorsement of hierarchy-attenuating ideologies (e.g., human rights, social justice).
- Greater empathy and tolerance toward out-groups.
- Support for policies that promote social equality (e.g., affirmative action, wealth redistribution).

#### Social and Political Behavior

Individuals with high SDO tend to:
- Prefer social and political environments that maintain existing hierarchies.
- Engage in behaviors that reinforce social dominance (e.g., discriminatory practices).
- Align with conservative and right-wing political parties and policies.

Individuals with low SDO tend to:
- Advocate for social change and reforms aimed at reducing inequality.
- Engage in behaviors that promote social justice (e.g., volunteering for human rights organizations).
- Align with liberal and left-wing political parties and policies.

### Theoretical Implications

#### Maintenance of Social Hierarchies

SDO is a crucial individual difference variable that helps explain the persistence of social hierarchies. High SDO individuals are more likely to occupy and strive for positions of power, thereby reinforcing hierarchical structures.

#### Intergroup Relations

SDO influences intergroup relations by shaping attitudes and behaviors toward out-groups. High SDO individuals are more likely to exhibit intergroup hostility and support policies that disadvantage out-groups, while low SDO individuals are more likely to exhibit intergroup solidarity and support inclusive policies.

### Empirical Evidence

#### Cross-Cultural Validity

Studies across diverse cultural contexts have validated the construct of SDO, demonstrating consistent relationships between SDO, hierarchy-enhancing beliefs, and prejudicial attitudes. However, the expression and impact of SDO can vary depending on cultural norms and societal structures.

#### Longitudinal Studies

Longitudinal research indicates that SDO is relatively stable over time, suggesting that it is a robust personality trait. Changes in SDO can occur due to significant life events or shifts in social context, but these changes are typically gradual.

### Criticisms and Challenges

#### Measurement Issues

Critics argue that the SDO scale may not fully capture the complexity of individuals' attitudes toward hierarchy and equality. Efforts to refine the scale and develop multi-dimensional measures are ongoing.

#### Contextual Influences

While SDO is a significant predictor of attitudes and behaviors, it does not operate in isolation. Contextual factors such as socio-economic status, cultural background, and immediate social environment also play crucial roles in shaping individuals' preferences for social hierarchy.

### Conclusion

Social Dominance Orientation is a foundational concept in understanding the dynamics of social hierarchies and intergroup relations. By examining individual differences in SDO, researchers can gain insights into the psychological underpinnings of social inequality and the perpetuation of group-based dominance.
