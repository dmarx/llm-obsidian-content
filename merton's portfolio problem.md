Merton's portfolio problem

### Merton's Portfolio Problem

Merton's portfolio problem is a foundational model in continuous-time [[finance]], developed by economist Robert C. Merton. It provides a framework for optimal investment and consumption decisions over time, considering the trade-offs between current consumption, future wealth, and risk. This model is a cornerstone of modern financial theory, particularly in the context of dynamic portfolio optimization.

#### Key Concepts and Assumptions

1. **Investment Horizon**: The model assumes an infinite or finite investment horizon over which an individual makes consumption and investment decisions.
2. **Asset Dynamics**: The financial market consists of a risk-free asset (e.g., a bond) and one or more risky assets (e.g., stocks), with their prices following stochastic processes.
3. **Preferences**: The investor has preferences over consumption and wealth, typically represented by a utility function that captures their risk aversion and intertemporal preferences.
4. **Utility Function**: Commonly used [[utility functions]] in Merton's problem include the Constant Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA) utility function and the Constant Absolute Risk Aversion (CARA) utility function.

#### Mathematical Formulation

1. **Wealth Dynamics**: The wealth process \( W(t) \) evolves according to the investment in risky and risk-free assets. Let \( \pi(t) \) denote the proportion of wealth invested in the risky asset, and \( c(t) \) denote the consumption rate at time \( t \).

   $$ dW(t) = \left[ W(t) (r + \pi(t) (\mu - r)) - c(t) \right] dt + \pi(t) W(t) \sigma dB(t) $$

   where:
   - \( W(t) \): Wealth at time \( t \).
   - \( r \): Risk-free rate.
   - \( \mu \): Expected return on the risky asset.
   - \( \sigma \): Volatility of the risky asset.
   - \( B(t) \): Standard Brownian motion.

2. **Utility Function**: The objective is to maximize the expected utility of consumption and terminal wealth. For CRRA utility, the utility function is:

   $$ U(c) = \frac{c^{1-\gamma}}{1-\gamma} $$

   where \( \gamma \) is the relative risk aversion coefficient.

3. **Objective**: The optimization problem is to maximize the expected discounted utility of consumption and terminal wealth:

   $$ \max_{\pi(t), c(t)} E \left[ \int_0^T e^{-\rho t} U(c(t)) dt + e^{-\rho T} U(W(T)) \right] $$

   where \( \rho \) is the subjective discount rate.

#### Solution to Merton's Problem

Merton's problem can be solved using dynamic programming and the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. The value function \( V(W, t) \) represents the maximum expected utility given the wealth \( W \) at time \( t \).

1. **Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Equation**: The HJB equation for this problem is:

   $$ \rho V(W, t) = \max_{\pi, c} \left[ U(c) + V_W(W, t) (W (r + \pi (\mu - r)) - c) + \frac{1}{2} V_{WW}(W, t) (\pi W \sigma)^2 \right] $$

2. **Optimal Policies**:
   - **Optimal Consumption**: The optimal consumption rate is proportional to wealth:

     $$ c^*(t) = \frac{W(t)}{1/\gamma} $$

   - **Optimal Portfolio**: The optimal proportion of wealth invested in the risky asset is:

     $$ \pi^*(t) = \frac{\mu - r}{\gamma \sigma^2} $$

3. **Interpretation**:
   - The optimal consumption strategy implies that the individual consumes a constant fraction of their wealth.
   - The optimal investment strategy implies that the proportion of wealth invested in the risky asset depends on the risk premium (\( \mu - r \)), the individual's risk aversion (\( \gamma \)), and the volatility of the risky asset (\( \sigma \)).

#### Extensions and Generalizations

1. **Multiple Risky Assets**: Merton's model can be extended to multiple risky assets by incorporating a vector of returns and a covariance matrix of returns.
2. **Stochastic Interest Rates**: The model can be adapted to include stochastic interest rates, allowing for a more realistic representation of the financial market.
3. **Labor Income**: Extensions can include labor income, where the individual receives a stream of income in addition to investment returns.
4. **Constraints**: Real-world constraints, such as borrowing limits and transaction costs, can be incorporated into the model to make it more applicable.

#### Practical Applications

1. **Retirement Planning**: Merton's problem provides a theoretical foundation for retirement planning, helping individuals determine optimal savings and investment strategies.
2. **Wealth Management**: Financial advisors use insights from Merton's model to tailor investment strategies to clients' risk preferences and financial goals.
3. **Dynamic Asset Allocation**: The model guides dynamic asset allocation, adjusting investment proportions in response to changing market conditions and investor circumstances.

### Summary

Merton's portfolio problem is a dynamic optimization framework for determining the optimal consumption and investment strategies over time. By modeling the evolution of wealth and considering preferences over consumption and wealth, the problem provides insights into the trade-offs between risk and return. The solution involves maximizing the expected utility of consumption and terminal wealth, leading to explicit strategies for consumption and investment. Extensions of the model accommodate multiple assets, stochastic interest rates, labor income, and real-world constraints, making it a versatile tool for financial planning and wealth management.
