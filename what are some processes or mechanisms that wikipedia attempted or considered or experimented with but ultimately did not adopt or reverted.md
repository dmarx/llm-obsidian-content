what are some processes or mechanisms that wikipedia attempted or considered or experimented with but ultimately did not adopt or reverted?


**ASSISTANT**

Wikipedia, as a large and dynamic community-driven project, has experimented with numerous processes and mechanisms to manage its content and community. Not all of these initiatives have been successful or sustainable. Below are some notable processes and mechanisms that were attempted, considered, or experimented with but ultimately not adopted or reverted:

### Flagged Revisions

**Description**: 
- Flagged Revisions (or Pending Changes) was a system where edits made to certain pages would not be visible to the general public until they were reviewed and approved by experienced editors.

**Experimentation and Outcome**:
- **Implementation**: First introduced on the German Wikipedia and later tested on the English Wikipedia.
- **Reversion**: While the system remains in limited use, particularly for highly vandalized or controversial pages, it was not widely adopted across all pages due to the backlog it created and the additional workload on editors. The English Wikipedia opted for a more selective use of Pending Changes rather than a blanket application.

### Superprotect

**Description**: 
- Superprotect was a user right that allowed Wikimedia Foundation staff to protect pages in a way that even administrators could not override.

**Experimentation and Outcome**:
- **Implementation**: Introduced in 2014 during a conflict over the implementation of the Media Viewer feature.
- **Reversion**: The feature was highly controversial as it was seen as undermining community autonomy. After significant backlash from the community, including a request from the German Wikipedia to remove it, Superprotect was deprecated in 2015.

### Article Feedback Tool

**Description**: 
- The Article Feedback Tool was designed to allow readers to provide feedback on the quality of Wikipedia articles.

**Experimentation and Outcome**:
- **Implementation**: Deployed on the English Wikipedia and several other language versions.
- **Reversion**: The tool faced issues with low-quality feedback and spam, making it difficult for editors to derive useful insights. It was phased out in 2014, although discussions about alternative feedback mechanisms continue.

### Wikitrust

**Description**: 
- WikiTrust was an experimental tool designed to evaluate the trustworthiness of Wikipedia content by analyzing the reputation of authors and the longevity of their contributions.

**Experimentation and Outcome**:
- **Implementation**: Tested as a browser extension and integrated into a few language versions of Wikipedia.
- **Reversion**: The tool did not gain widespread adoption due to technical challenges and concerns about the accuracy and reliability of the trust metrics. It was eventually discontinued.

### VisualEditor

**Description**: 
- VisualEditor is a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor intended to make editing Wikipedia easier for newcomers by providing a visual editing interface.

**Experimentation and Outcome**:
- **Implementation**: Introduced in 2013 and initially set as the default editor for new and anonymous users.
- **Reversion**: Due to significant bugs, performance issues, and community resistance, it was removed as the default editor but remains available as an opt-in feature. Continuous improvements have been made, but the community largely prefers the classic wikitext editor for its reliability and flexibility.

### Flow (Structured Discussions)

**Description**: 
- Flow is a project aimed at creating a more structured and user-friendly discussion system for Wikipedia talk pages.

**Experimentation and Outcome**:
- **Implementation**: Deployed on a few test pages and project talk pages.
- **Reversion**: The reception was mixed due to the inflexibility compared to traditional talk pages and resistance to change from the community. Development has largely stalled, and Flow is not widely used.

### Knowledge Engine

**Description**: 
- The Knowledge Engine was a project by the Wikimedia Foundation aimed at developing a search engine for Wikipedia and its sister projects.

**Experimentation and Outcome**:
- **Implementation**: Funded and initiated with the aim of improving search capabilities.
- **Reversion**: The project faced transparency issues and community backlash due to concerns over scope, necessity, and potential duplication of efforts with existing search engines. It was eventually shelved.

### Controversial Content Filters

**Description**: 
- Proposed systems to filter controversial content, such as images, based on user preferences.

**Experimentation and Outcome**:
- **Implementation**: Discussed in response to concerns about sensitive content.
- **Reversion**: The proposal faced significant debate over censorship and freedom of information. The community opposed the idea, leading to its abandonment.

### Automated Content Creation (Bots)

**Description**: 
- Various bots were proposed to create content automatically, especially in underrepresented language editions of Wikipedia.

**Experimentation and Outcome**:
- **Implementation**: Some bots were tested to create basic articles using structured data.
- **Reversion**: While some bot-created content remains, extensive use of automated content creation was limited due to concerns about quality, verifiability, and the human touch in content creation.

### Conclusion

Wikipedia's iterative and community-driven approach to governance and process implementation means that many ideas are tested, discussed, and sometimes discarded based on community feedback and practical outcomes. These experiments reflect the project's commitment to balancing innovation with the preservation of core values like reliability, transparency, and community consensus. Understanding these past experiments can provide valuable lessons for future initiatives within the Wikimedia movement. For further study, consider exploring the specifics of each mechanism, such as the [[Superprotect]], [[VisualEditor]], and [[Flow]] projects.
