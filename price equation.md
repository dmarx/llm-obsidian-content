## The Price Equation

The Price equation is a mathematical formulation that describes how the average value of a trait changes from one generation to the next due to natural selection and transmission. It provides a powerful and general framework for understanding evolutionary change, applicable to genetic, cultural, and other forms of inheritance.

### Key Concepts

1. **Trait Value ($z_i$)**: The value of the trait for individual $i$.
2. **Fitness ($w_i$)**: The reproductive success of individual $i$, often measured as the number of offspring.
3. **Average Trait Value ($\bar{z}$)**: The mean value of the trait in the population.

### The Equation

The Price equation can be expressed in its most basic form as:

$$
\Delta \bar{z} = \mathrm{Cov}(w_i, z_i) + \mathbb{E}(w_i \Delta z_i)
$$

where:
- $\Delta \bar{z}$ is the change in the average trait value in the population.
- $\mathrm{Cov}(w_i, z_i)$ is the covariance between fitness and trait value, capturing the effect of selection.
- $\mathbb{E}(w_i \Delta z_i)$ is the expected change in the trait value due to transmission bias.

### Components of the Price Equation

1. **Covariance Term ($\mathrm{Cov}(w_i, z_i)$)**:
   - This term quantifies the association between the trait and fitness. If individuals with higher trait values tend to have higher fitness, this term will be positive, indicating that selection favors higher trait values.
   - Mathematically, it is defined as:
     $$
     \mathrm{Cov}(w_i, z_i) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (w_i - \bar{w})(z_i - \bar{z})
     $$
     where $N$ is the population size, $\bar{w}$ is the average fitness, and $\bar{z}$ is the average trait value.

2. **Expectation Term ($\mathbb{E}(w_i \Delta z_i)$)**:
   - This term accounts for changes in the trait value that are not due to selection, such as mutation, recombination, or cultural transmission biases.
   - $\Delta z_i$ represents the change in the trait value of the offspring of individual $i$ compared to the parent.

### Extensions of the Price Equation

The Price equation can be extended to consider multiple levels of selection, such as individual and group selection, and to decompose evolutionary change into more detailed components.

#### Multilevel Selection

In multilevel selection, we consider selection acting at both the individual level and the group level. The Price equation can be extended to reflect this:

$$
\Delta \bar{z} = \mathrm{Cov}_G(W_G, \bar{z}_G) + \mathbb{E}(W_G \Delta \bar{z}_G)
$$

where:
- $\mathrm{Cov}_G(W_G, \bar{z}_G)$ is the covariance between group fitness and the group average trait value, capturing between-group selection.
- $\mathbb{E}(W_G \Delta \bar{z}_G)$ is the expected change in the group average trait value due to within-group selection and other factors.

### Applications

The Price equation has broad applications in evolutionary biology, including:

- **Natural Selection**: Quantifying how traits associated with higher fitness increase in frequency.
- **Genetic Evolution**: Analyzing changes in allele frequencies in populations.
- **Cultural Evolution**: Studying the transmission and evolution of cultural traits.
- **Epidemiology**: Understanding the evolution of pathogen traits such as virulence.

### Example

Consider a population of organisms where we want to study the evolution of a particular trait, say body size. Let $z_i$ represent the body size of individual $i$, and $w_i$ their fitness.

1. **Calculate the Average Trait Value**:
   $$ \bar{z} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} z_i $$

2. **Calculate the Covariance Term**:
   $$ \mathrm{Cov}(w_i, z_i) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (w_i - \bar{w})(z_i - \bar{z}) $$

3. **Calculate the Expectation Term**:
   $$ \mathbb{E}(w_i \Delta z_i) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i \Delta z_i $$

By plugging these terms into the Price equation, we can determine the change in the average body size of the population from one generation to the next.

### Conclusion

The Price equation provides a unifying framework for understanding evolutionary change. Its ability to decompose the effects of selection and transmission makes it a versatile tool for studying both biological and [[cultural evolution]]. By applying this equation, researchers can gain insights into the dynamics of trait evolution across different contexts and levels of selection.
