skin friction drag


**ASSISTANT**

**Skin friction drag** is the resistive force that results from the friction between a fluid (such as air or water) and the surface of a solid object moving through that fluid. It is one of the primary components of **aerodynamic drag** or **hydrodynamic drag** experienced by objects such as aircraft, vehicles, or ships.

Skin friction drag arises due to the **viscous forces** within the fluid and the **[[no-slip condition]]**, which requires that the fluid in contact with the solid surface has zero velocity relative to the surface. As a result, the fluid velocity gradually increases from zero at the surface to the free-stream velocity in the flow away from the surface, forming a **boundary layer**. Within this boundary layer, the fluid experiences a velocity gradient, leading to **shear stress** along the surface, which manifests as skin friction drag.

### Components of Total Drag

The total drag on an object moving through a fluid can be decomposed into two main components:
1. **Skin friction drag**: Drag due to the shear stress acting on the surface of the object because of the fluid's viscosity.
2. **Pressure drag** (or **form drag**): Drag resulting from the pressure difference between the front and rear of the object, often due to flow separation and [[wake formation]].

For **streamlined bodies**, such as aircraft wings or fish, skin friction drag can be the dominant source of drag. For **bluff bodies**, such as a flat plate or cylinder, pressure drag dominates.

### Mechanism of Skin Friction Drag

Skin friction drag originates from the **shear stress** exerted by the fluid on the surface of the object. This shear stress arises from the **velocity gradient** within the boundary layer, where the fluid velocity transitions from zero (at the surface, due to the [[no-slip condition]]) to the free-stream velocity.

The **shear stress** $\tau_w$ at the wall is given by:
$$
\tau_w = \mu \left. \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} \right|_{y=0}
$$
where:
- $\mu$ is the **dynamic viscosity** of the fluid,
- $\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}$ is the **velocity gradient** perpendicular to the surface,
- $u$ is the velocity in the direction of the flow,
- $y=0$ corresponds to the surface of the object.

This shear stress exerts a resistive force on the object in the flow direction, which is the skin friction drag.

### Boundary Layer and Skin Friction Drag

The development of the **boundary layer** on a surface plays a key role in determining the magnitude of skin friction drag. The behavior of the boundary layer can vary depending on the Reynolds number and flow conditions:

1. **Laminar Boundary Layer**: In the early stages of flow over a surface, the boundary layer is typically **laminar**, meaning the flow is smooth, with fluid layers sliding over each other in an orderly fashion. In a laminar boundary layer, momentum transfer is dominated by molecular diffusion (viscous forces). The skin friction drag in a laminar boundary layer is lower than in a turbulent boundary layer.

2. **Turbulent Boundary Layer**: At higher Reynolds numbers, the flow transitions to a **turbulent boundary layer**, characterized by chaotic fluid motion and mixing. Turbulence enhances momentum transfer within the boundary layer, resulting in **increased shear stress** and, consequently, higher skin friction drag compared to a laminar boundary layer. However, a turbulent boundary layer is less prone to flow separation, which reduces pressure drag.

3. **Transition Region**: Between the laminar and turbulent regimes is a transition region, where disturbances in the laminar flow begin to amplify (e.g., Tollmien-Schlichting waves), eventually leading to turbulence. During this transition, skin friction drag increases as the boundary layer becomes more turbulent.

The boundary layer thickness ($\delta$) grows as fluid moves along the surface. In a laminar boundary layer, the thickness increases as:
$$
\delta \sim \frac{x}{\sqrt{Re_x}}
$$
where $x$ is the distance from the leading edge, and $Re_x$ is the **local Reynolds number** based on the distance $x$.

### Factors Affecting Skin Friction Drag

1. **Reynolds Number** ($Re$):
   The **Reynolds number** is the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces and is a key parameter in determining the nature of the boundary layer:
   $$
   Re = \frac{\rho u L}{\mu}
   $$
   where:
   - $\rho$ is the fluid density,
   - $u$ is the free-stream velocity,
   - $L$ is a characteristic length (e.g., the length of a plate or the diameter of a cylinder),
   - $\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity.

   Higher Reynolds numbers generally lead to an earlier transition to turbulence, increasing skin friction drag. At lower Reynolds numbers, the flow remains laminar, reducing skin friction drag.

2. **Surface Roughness**:
   The **roughness of the surface** affects the development of the boundary layer. A smooth surface promotes a laminar boundary layer, reducing skin friction drag. Conversely, a rough surface can trigger early transition to turbulence, increasing drag. In some cases (such as golf balls), adding roughness can delay flow separation, reducing pressure drag while slightly increasing skin friction drag.

3. **Flow Velocity**:
   Higher flow velocities increase the Reynolds number and promote turbulence, leading to higher skin friction drag.

4. **Fluid Viscosity**:
   Higher viscosity fluids exhibit higher skin friction drag due to increased shear stress. For example, in **oil** or **water**, skin friction drag is much greater than in air, as liquids have higher viscosity than gases.

5. **Surface Area**:
   Skin friction drag is proportional to the surface area exposed to the flow. Larger surface areas increase the total drag experienced by an object.

### Formula for Skin Friction Drag

The total **skin friction drag force** ($F_{d,\text{skin}}$) acting on an object is the integral of the shear stress over the surface area ($A_s$) exposed to the fluid:
$$
F_{d,\text{skin}} = \int_{A_s} \tau_w \, dA
$$
For simple geometries like a flat plate, empirical formulas based on the boundary layer theory provide estimates for skin friction drag.

#### For Laminar Flow over a Flat Plate:
The **drag coefficient** for skin friction drag in a laminar boundary layer is:
$$
C_{f,\text{laminar}} = \frac{1.328}{\sqrt{Re_x}}
$$
where $Re_x = \frac{u x}{\nu}$ is the local Reynolds number based on the distance from the leading edge $x$ and $\nu = \frac{\mu}{\rho}$ is the kinematic viscosity.

#### For Turbulent Flow over a Flat Plate:
For turbulent flow, the skin friction drag coefficient is given by the empirical formula:
$$
C_{f,\text{turbulent}} = \frac{0.074}{Re_x^{1/5}}
$$
These coefficients are used to calculate the skin friction drag force:
$$
F_{d,\text{skin}} = \frac{1}{2} C_f \rho u^2 A_s
$$
where:
- $C_f$ is the skin friction drag coefficient,
- $\rho$ is the fluid density,
- $u$ is the free-stream velocity,
- $A_s$ is the wetted surface area.

### Reducing Skin Friction Drag

In engineering applications, minimizing skin friction drag is essential for improving efficiency and performance. Various strategies are employed to reduce skin friction drag:

1. **Laminar Flow Control**:
   - By maintaining laminar flow over surfaces for as long as possible, engineers can reduce drag. This can be achieved through careful design of aerodynamic surfaces or by using **suction** to stabilize the boundary layer.

2. **Surface Smoothing**:
   - Reducing surface roughness delays the transition to turbulence, minimizing skin friction drag. This is important in aircraft, where smooth surfaces are crucial for drag reduction.

3. **Riblets and Microstructures**:
   - Inspired by sharkskin, **riblets** (small, aligned surface structures) can reduce skin friction drag by channeling fluid and reducing turbulence near the surface.

4. **Superhydrophobic Surfaces**:
   - Surfaces that repel water can reduce drag in fluid flows, particularly in water. These surfaces create a thin layer of air between the fluid and the surface, reducing the contact area and shear stress.

### Summary

**Skin friction drag** arises from the shear stress exerted by a fluid as it flows over the surface of an object. It is a significant component of drag, particularly in streamlined bodies, and is influenced by factors such as **Reynolds number**, **surface roughness**, **flow velocity**, and **fluid viscosity**. Controlling skin friction drag is essential for improving the aerodynamic and hydrodynamic performance of vehicles, aircraft, and ships. Various methods, including laminar flow control, surface treatments, and microstructures, are used to reduce skin friction drag and enhance the efficiency of fluid systems.
