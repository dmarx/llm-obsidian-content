# Intelligence Quotient (IQ)

[[Intelligence Quotient]] (IQ) is a standardized numerical measure derived from performance on [[psychometric tests]] designed to assess human [[cognitive abilities]]. The concept emerged from early work by [[Alfred Binet]] and [[Theodore Simon]] in the early 20th century, who developed tests to identify French schoolchildren needing special educational support.

## Mathematical Formalization

Originally, IQ was calculated using the formula:

$$\text{IQ} = \frac{\text{Mental Age}}{\text{Chronological Age}} \times 100$$

Modern IQ tests use a [[normal distribution]] with:
- Mean ($\mu$) = 100
- Standard deviation ($\sigma$) = 15 (for most tests)

For a given raw score $X$ on an IQ test, the standardized score follows:

$$\text{IQ} = 100 + 15 \times \frac{X - \mu_X}{\sigma_X}$$

Where $\mu_X$ and $\sigma_X$ are the population mean and standard deviation of raw scores.

## Statistical Distribution

IQ scores theoretically follow a [[Gaussian distribution]]:

$$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^2}$$

This yields the following approximate population percentiles:
- IQ 70: 2nd percentile
- IQ 85: 16th percentile
- IQ 100: 50th percentile
- IQ 115: 84th percentile
- IQ 130: 98th percentile
- IQ 145: 99.9th percentile

## Major IQ Tests

Contemporary standardized tests include:
- [[Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale]] (WAIS)
- [[Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale]]
- [[Raven's Progressive Matrices]]
- [[Cattell Culture Fair Intelligence Test]]

## Psychometric Properties

### Reliability
IQ tests demonstrate high [[test-retest reliability]], typically $r > 0.8$, indicating consistency of measurement over time.

### Validity
Various forms of validity have been established:
- [[Construct validity]]: Correlation with other cognitive measures
- [[Predictive validity]]: Correlation with academic and professional outcomes
- [[Concurrent validity]]: Correlation with current achievement metrics

## Factor Structure of Intelligence

IQ tests typically assess multiple cognitive domains that correlate to form a [[hierarchical factor structure]]:

1. **[[g factor]]** (general intelligence): The common variance among all cognitive abilities
2. **[[Broad abilities]]**: 
   - [[Fluid intelligence]] ($G_f$): Novel problem-solving
   - [[Crystallized intelligence]] ($G_c$): Acquired knowledge
   - [[Processing speed]] ($G_s$)
   - [[Working memory]] ($G_{wm}$)
   - [[Visual-spatial processing]] ($G_v$)

This structure is captured in the [[Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory]] (CHC), formalized as:

$$X_i = \lambda_i g + \sum_{j=1}^k \lambda_{ij} f_j + \epsilon_i$$

Where:
- $X_i$ is performance on test item $i$
- $\lambda_i$ is the loading of item $i$ on $g$
- $\lambda_{ij}$ is the loading of item $i$ on broad ability factor $j$
- $\epsilon_i$ is unique variance

## Controversies and Limitations

- **[[Flynn effect]]**: The secular increase in IQ scores over time (approximately 3 points per decade)
- **[[Differential item functioning]]**: Potential measurement bias across demographic groups
- **[[Stereotype threat]]**: Performance decrements due to anxiety about confirming negative stereotypes
- **[[Ecological validity]]**: The extent to which test performance correlates with real-world outcomes

## Mathematical and Computational Extensions

Recent approaches include:
- [[Item Response Theory]] (IRT): Probabilistic models of test item difficulty
- [[Computational cognitive models]]: Formal mechanisms underlying performance
- [[Network psychometrics]]: Intelligence as emergent property of interacting cognitive processes

The IRT model can be formalized as:

$$P(X_{ij} = 1|\theta_i, b_j, a_j) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-a_j(\theta_i - b_j)}}$$

Where:
- $P(X_{ij} = 1|\theta_i, b_j, a_j)$ is the probability of person $i$ correctly answering item $j$
- $\theta_i$ is the latent ability of person $i$
- $b_j$ is the difficulty parameter of item $j$ 
- $a_j$ is the discrimination parameter of item $j$

## Related Concepts

- [[Emotional intelligence]] (EI): The ability to perceive, understand, and manage emotions
- [[Multiple intelligences]]: Theory proposing distinct types of cognitive abilities
- [[Cognitive complexity]]: Multidimensional approach to measuring intellectual sophistication
- [[Metacognition]]: Awareness and understanding of one's thought processes
