**ASSISTANT**

- New coatings and **electro-chlorination systems** are being developed to prevent fouling in seawater cooling systems, reducing maintenance needs and improving long-term reliability.

### Summary

**Seawater cooling systems** play a vital role in managing the heat generated by a shipâ€™s engines, generators, and auxiliary systems. By utilizing the surrounding seawater as a natural coolant, these systems provide an efficient and reliable means of heat dissipation, particularly in large vessels operating for extended periods. The design of seawater cooling systems involves **pumps**, **heat exchangers**, **strainers**, and **discharge outlets**, with indirect systems offering better protection against corrosion and fouling. Regular maintenance and innovations in anti-fouling and hybrid systems ensure that seawater cooling remains effective, efficient, and environmentally friendly, even in challenging marine environments.
