Thickened Flame Regime


**ASSISTANT**

The **Thickened Flame Regime** in turbulent combustion refers to a scenario where the flame front is not a thin sheet as in laminar flames, but is thickened due to the interaction with turbulent eddies. This regime occurs when the turbulence intensity is strong enough to influence the flame structure but not so strong as to completely disrupt the flame front, as in the distributed reaction regime. The thickened flame regime is particularly relevant in modeling and simulating premixed and partially premixed flames in turbulent flows.

### 1. **Characteristics of the Thickened Flame Regime**

In the thickened flame regime, the flame structure is influenced by turbulence, leading to a broader reaction zone compared to a laminar flame. The main characteristics of this regime include:

#### **1.1 Flame Thickening**
- **Broadened Flame Front**: The flame front is thicker than in the laminar case due to the interaction with turbulence. This thickening is a result of the flame being stretched, wrinkled, and distorted by turbulent eddies.
- **Enhanced Mixing**: The thickened flame experiences enhanced mixing of reactants and products due to the increased surface area of the flame front caused by turbulence. This mixing can influence the flame speed and stability.

#### **1.2 Interaction with Turbulence**
- **Moderate Turbulence Intensity**: The thickened flame regime occurs at moderate turbulence intensities, where the turbulence is strong enough to modify the flame structure but not strong enough to fully disrupt the flame front or cause significant flame quenching.
- **Intermediate Damköhler Number (\(Da\))**: The Damköhler number, which compares the chemical reaction time to the turbulent mixing time, is intermediate in this regime. This indicates a balance between the chemical reactions and turbulent mixing processes.
- **Moderate Karlovitz Number (\(Ka\))**: The Karlovitz number, which compares the smallest turbulent eddy time scale to the chemical reaction time, is moderate, meaning that turbulence has a noticeable effect on the flame but does not completely dominate the combustion process.

#### **1.3 Flame Surface Area and Propagation**
- **Increased Surface Area**: Turbulence increases the surface area of the flame front through wrinkling and stretching, which can enhance the overall burning rate by exposing more fuel to the reaction zone.
- **Flame Propagation**: The flame propagates through the turbulent flow field, with the local flame speed being influenced by both the laminar flame speed and the effects of turbulence.

### 2. **Modeling the Thickened Flame Regime**

The thickened flame regime requires specific modeling approaches to capture the effects of turbulence on the flame structure. Several methods have been developed to simulate this regime in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models.

#### **2.1 Thickened Flame Model (TFM)**
The Thickened Flame Model (TFM) is a popular approach for modeling the thickened flame regime in LES (Large Eddy Simulation) and other CFD frameworks. The TFM artificially thickens the flame front to a scale that can be resolved on the computational grid while preserving the correct flame propagation speed and overall flame dynamics.

- **Artificial Flame Thickening**: The TFM increases the flame thickness by artificially thickening the flame front. This allows the flame structure to be resolved on the computational grid without requiring an extremely fine mesh.
- **Modified Transport Coefficients**: To maintain the correct flame propagation speed despite the thickening, the model adjusts the transport coefficients, such as thermal conductivity and diffusivity, ensuring that the flame's characteristics remain physically accurate.
- **Effective Reaction Rate**: The reaction rate is modified to account for the thickened flame, ensuring that the model captures the correct rate of heat release and species conversion.

#### **2.2 Flame Surface Density (FSD) Models**
Flame Surface Density (FSD) models are used to account for the increased surface area of the flame front in the thickened flame regime. These models describe the flame's behavior in terms of the flame surface density, which represents the area of the flame surface per unit volume.

- **Flame Stretch and Curvature**: FSD models incorporate the effects of flame stretch and curvature, which are critical in the thickened flame regime due to the wrinkling and folding of the flame front by turbulence.
- **Source Terms**: The FSD approach includes source terms that describe the production and destruction of flame surface area due to turbulence, chemical reactions, and strain.

#### **2.3 Hybrid LES-RANS Models**
In some cases, hybrid LES-RANS (Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes) models are used to simulate the thickened flame regime, particularly in complex or large-scale systems. These models combine the strengths of LES (which resolves large eddies and the thickened flame structure) with RANS (which provides a cost-effective approach to modeling smaller scales).

- **LES for Large-Scale Structures**: LES is used to resolve the large-scale turbulent structures that influence the thickened flame.
- **RANS for Sub-Grid Scales**: RANS models are employed to capture the effects of smaller, unresolved scales, which are important in regions where the flame interacts with turbulence.

### 3. **Applications of the Thickened Flame Regime**

The thickened flame regime is relevant in a variety of practical applications where turbulence influences the flame structure, but the flame remains coherent and propagates through the flow:

#### **3.1 Gas Turbines**
- **Premixed and Partially Premixed Combustion**: In gas turbines, the thickened flame regime is often encountered in premixed and partially premixed combustion, where the flame is influenced by the high turbulence levels in the combustor. Accurate modeling of this regime is crucial for predicting emissions, flame stability, and efficiency.

#### **3.2 Internal Combustion Engines**
- **Spark-Ignition Engines**: In spark-ignition engines, the flame propagates through a turbulent fuel-air mixture, leading to a thickened flame front. Modeling this regime helps in optimizing combustion efficiency and reducing emissions.

#### **3.3 Industrial Burners**
- **High-Turbulence Burners**: Industrial burners operating under high turbulence conditions often exhibit thickened flames. Understanding and modeling this regime is important for controlling the combustion process, ensuring complete fuel burnout, and minimizing pollutant formation.

#### **3.4 Aero-Engines**
- **Combustor Design**: In aero-engine combustors, the thickened flame regime can occur under certain operating conditions, influencing the design of the combustor for stable and efficient combustion across a range of altitudes and speeds.

### 4. **Challenges and Considerations**

Despite the usefulness of the thickened flame model, there are challenges and limitations associated with this regime:

#### **4.1 Resolution Requirements**
- **Grid Dependence**: The accuracy of the thickened flame model depends on the grid resolution. If the grid is too coarse, important features of the flame structure may be lost, leading to inaccuracies in the simulation results.

#### **4.2 Modeling Turbulence-Combustion Interaction**
- **Complex Interactions**: The interaction between turbulence and the flame in the thickened flame regime is complex, involving a balance between flame stretching, wrinkling, and chemical reaction rates. Capturing these interactions accurately requires sophisticated models and careful calibration.

#### **4.3 Flame Quenching and Extinction**
- **Localized Extinction**: In regions of very high turbulence or strain, the flame can be locally quenched, leading to extinction. Modeling these phenomena within the thickened flame regime requires additional considerations, such as incorporating extinction models or local flame speed adjustments.

#### **4.4 Transition to Distributed Reaction Regime**
- **Boundary with Distributed Reaction Regime**: The thickened flame regime lies between the [[flamelet regime]] and the distributed reaction regime. Understanding and accurately modeling the transition between these regimes is challenging, especially in situations where the turbulence intensity varies spatially or temporally.

### 5. **Conclusion**

The thickened flame regime represents an important combustion regime where turbulence significantly influences the flame structure, leading to a broadened reaction zone. This regime is particularly relevant in high-turbulence combustion systems, such as gas turbines, internal combustion engines, and industrial burners. Modeling approaches like the Thickened Flame Model (TFM), Flame Surface Density (FSD) models, and hybrid LES-RANS models are commonly used to simulate this regime, capturing the key effects of turbulence on flame propagation and structure. Despite challenges such as resolution requirements and complex turbulence-combustion interactions, the thickened flame regime remains a crucial area of study in the field of turbulent combustion.
