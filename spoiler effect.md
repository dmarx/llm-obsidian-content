### Spoiler Effect

The spoiler effect occurs in elections when a candidate who has little chance of winning takes votes away from a major candidate, potentially causing the more preferred candidate to lose. This effect is particularly prominent in plurality [[voting systems]] but can occur in various [[voting systems]] where votes for similar candidates split, resulting in the election of a less preferred candidate.

### Key Concepts

1. **Plurality Voting**: A voting system where each voter selects one candidate, and the candidate with the most votes wins.
2. **Vote Splitting**: When votes are divided among similar candidates, reducing the chance of any of those candidates winning.
3. **Third-Party Candidate**: A candidate who is not from one of the main parties and is unlikely to win but can affect the outcome by taking votes from a major candidate.

### Example

Consider an election with three candidates: A, B, and C, with the following voter preferences:

- 40% of voters prefer A > B > C
- 35% of voters prefer B > C > A
- 25% of voters prefer C > B > A

**Outcome Without Spoiler**:

- If candidate C were not in the race, the votes would likely split between A and B, with A winning 40% to 35%.

**Outcome With Spoiler**:

- With candidate C in the race, C takes 25% of the votes, and the remaining 75% is split between A and B.
- This vote splitting causes A to win with 40% of the vote, despite 60% of voters preferring B over A.

### Voting Systems and the Spoiler Effect

#### 1. Plurality Voting

**Description**: Each voter selects one candidate, and the candidate with the most votes wins.

**Susceptibility to Spoiler Effect**: High. Plurality voting is highly susceptible to the spoiler effect because it does not consider voters' full preferences.

**Example**: In the 2000 U.S. presidential election, Ralph Nader's candidacy is often cited as a spoiler that affected the outcome between George W. Bush and Al Gore.

#### 2. Runoff Voting

**Description**: If no candidate receives a majority of votes in the first round, a runoff is held between the top two candidates.

**Susceptibility to Spoiler Effect**: Lower than plurality voting, but still present in the first round. The runoff round reduces the impact of the spoiler effect by focusing on the top two candidates.

**Example**: In the French presidential elections, runoff voting helps ensure the winner has majority support, reducing the spoiler effect seen in the first round.

#### 3. Ranked Choice Voting (Instant Runoff Voting)

**Description**: Voters rank candidates in order of preference. If no candidate receives a majority of first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and votes are transferred until one candidate has a majority.

**Susceptibility to Spoiler Effect**: Low. Ranked choice voting significantly reduces the spoiler effect by allowing voters to rank their preferences, ensuring that votes for less popular candidates are transferred to more viable candidates.

**Example**: In the Australian House of Representatives elections, ranked choice voting helps mitigate the spoiler effect by considering voters' second and third choices.

#### 4. Approval Voting

**Description**: Voters can vote for (approve) as many candidates as they like. The candidate with the most approvals wins.

**Susceptibility to Spoiler Effect**: Lower than plurality voting. Approval voting reduces the spoiler effect by allowing voters to support multiple candidates, thus not wasting their vote on less viable candidates.

**Example**: In professional and academic society elections, approval voting helps ensure that widely acceptable candidates win, reducing the impact of spoilers.

#### 5. Single Transferable Vote (STV)

**Description**: A proportional representation system where voters rank candidates. Candidates are elected based on achieving a quota of votes, and surplus votes are transferred according to preferences.

**Susceptibility to Spoiler Effect**: Very low. STV effectively eliminates the spoiler effect by considering voters' full preferences and transferring surplus votes.

**Example**: In Ireland's parliamentary elections, STV ensures that votes for less popular candidates are transferred, minimizing the spoiler effect.

### Implications of the Spoiler Effect

1. **Strategic Voting**: Voters may feel compelled to vote strategically rather than sincerely, choosing a less preferred but more viable candidate to avoid wasting their vote.
2. **Distorted Outcomes**: The spoiler effect can lead to the election of a candidate who does not have the broadest support among voters.
3. **Barriers to Entry**: New or third-party candidates may be discouraged from running due to the risk of being labeled spoilers, limiting the diversity of choices for voters.

### Mitigating the Spoiler Effect

1. **Adopting Alternative Voting Systems**: Implementing systems like ranked choice voting, approval voting, or STV can reduce or eliminate the spoiler effect by considering voters' full preferences.
2. **Runoff Elections**: Holding runoff elections ensures that the final winner has majority support, reducing the impact of vote splitting in the initial round.
3. **Voter Education**: Educating voters about the implications of the spoiler effect and the benefits of alternative [[voting systems]] can help build support for reforms.

### Conclusion

The spoiler effect is a significant issue in plurality [[voting systems]], leading to strategic voting and potentially suboptimal election outcomes. By understanding the mechanics and implications of the spoiler effect, electoral systems can be designed or reformed to minimize its impact, ensuring fairer and more representative outcomes. Alternative [[voting systems]] such as ranked choice voting, approval voting, and STV offer viable solutions to mitigate the spoiler effect and better capture the true preferences of the electorate.
