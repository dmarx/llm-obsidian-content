**USER**

usenet


**ASSISTANT**

**Usenet** is one of the earliest decentralized systems for online communication, created in 1980 by Tom Truscott and Jim Ellis, both graduate students at Duke University. It predates the World Wide Web and is a system for sharing messages, discussions, and files across a global network of servers. Usenet was built on **Unix-to-Unix Copy Protocol (UUCP)**, which allowed for communication between computers over dial-up or other direct connections, though it eventually expanded to work over TCP/IP, the protocol of the modern internet.

### How Usenet Works

Usenet operates as a distributed bulletin board system, where users post messages (called articles) in topic-based groups called **newsgroups**. These newsgroups cover a vast array of topics, from technical discussions and hobbies to politics and entertainment. There are no central servers; instead, messages are propagated across a network of servers through a process known as **flooding**, where each Usenet server communicates with its peers to distribute new articles.

#### Key Features:
1. **Newsgroups:**
   - Newsgroups are categorized by topics, and their names reflect the hierarchical organization. For example:
     - `comp.*` (for computing-related topics)
     - `sci.*` (for science discussions)
     - `rec.*` (for recreation and hobbies)
     - `alt.*` (a free-form hierarchy with more informal and diverse topics)
   - Newsgroups function similarly to forums, with users posting questions, answers, discussions, or files.

2. **Posts (Articles):**
   - Articles are the individual messages or posts that users contribute. These can be text messages or binary files, such as images, audio, or software.

3. **Decentralization:**
   - Unlike modern social media or forums, there is no central authority or database. Instead, Usenet relies on **peer-to-peer propagation**. When a user posts an article, it is sent to a local Usenet server, which then forwards it to its peers, and so on, until the post reaches servers worldwide.
   
4. **Propagation Delay:**
   - Due to the decentralized nature of Usenet, articles can take time to propagate to all servers. There can be slight delays between when a post is submitted and when it is available on all servers.

5. **Retention:**
   - Usenet servers don't retain articles indefinitely. Depending on server capacity and settings, posts are deleted after a certain period, though popular posts may be archived by some servers or users.

### Historical Context and Usage

Usenet was immensely popular in the 1980s and 1990s, largely among academic and tech communities, and it played a significant role in early online culture. In contrast to the **World Wide Web**, which emerged in the early 1990s, Usenet was a key medium for sharing information, files, and discussions. 

**Usenet Hierarchies:**
- Usenet newsgroups are organized hierarchically, where each hierarchy corresponds to broad categories:
  - **`comp.*`** for computer-related topics
  - **`sci.*`** for scientific discussions
  - **`alt.*`** for alternative or uncategorized topics (with fewer moderation rules)
  
Some newsgroups were moderated, while others were open to unfiltered posts. This lack of central moderation contributed to both Usenet's strength (free expression) and its weaknesses (spam and off-topic posting).

### Key Features and Evolution
- **Binary Newsgroups:** In addition to text posts, Usenet also supported binary newsgroups, where users could share files like software, images, or music encoded in text format (such as **UUencode** or later **MIME**). These newsgroups were notorious for copyright issues, as they became a venue for the distribution of pirated content.
  
- **Kill Files and Filtering:** To manage spam and unwanted content, users could create "kill files," which allowed them to automatically ignore posts from specific users or containing certain keywords. This was an early form of content filtering.

### Usenet’s Decline and Legacy

While Usenet remains operational today, its popularity waned in the late 1990s and early 2000s due to the rise of the World Wide Web, email, and modern web forums. The arrival of centralized platforms like **Reddit**, **web-based forums**, and **social media** displaced Usenet’s role in online discussions. Additionally, the overwhelming flood of spam and illegal content in unmoderated newsgroups contributed to its decline.

However, the **binary newsgroups** for file sharing still maintain a niche user base today. Many internet service providers (ISPs) have stopped offering Usenet access, but third-party providers and open-source clients like **Giganews** or **NZBGet** are still available to those who seek access to Usenet.

### Key Contributions to Internet Culture

1. **Birth of Memes:** Usenet was a birthplace for early internet memes and jokes, with particular newsgroups devoted to humor, such as `[[alt.humor]]`. Many internet phenomena originated on Usenet, like the **Dancing Baby** or **Godwin's Law**, which states that as an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches 1.

2. **Spam and Early Internet Threats:** Usenet also saw some of the first instances of **spam**, the most famous being the **Green Card spam** incident in 1994, where two lawyers posted unsolicited advertisements across many newsgroups. This incident popularized the term **spam** to describe unwanted, mass-sent messages.

3. **Free Speech and Moderation Challenges:** Usenet was one of the earliest forums for online free speech. Its decentralized nature made it hard to regulate, and this often resulted in clashes over content moderation and governance, issues that persist in today’s social media platforms.

### Connection to Eternal September

Usenet's tight-knit, tech-savvy community dramatically changed after **Eternal September** in 1993. This event, caused by **America Online (AOL)** opening Usenet access to its users, led to an influx of millions of less experienced users who overwhelmed the community, disrupted norms, and contributed to Usenet's slow decline in terms of quality discussion and etiquette.
