### Wave Shoaling

**Wave shoaling** refers to the process by which ocean waves increase in height as they travel from deeper to shallower water. As waves approach the coastline, their speed decreases due to the interaction with the ocean floor, leading to a reduction in wavelength and an increase in wave height. This process is a key factor in the transformation of waves as they near the shore, eventually leading to wave breaking.

### The Physics of Wave Shoaling

1. **Wave Speed and Wavelength**:
   - **Deep Water Waves**: In deep water (where the water depth is greater than half the wavelength), wave speed \(c\) and wavelength \(L\) are related by the dispersion relation:
     $$
     c = \sqrt{\frac{gL}{2\pi}}
     $$
     where \(g\) is the acceleration due to gravity. In this deep-water regime, wave speed and wavelength are independent of water depth.
   - **Shallow Water Waves**: As waves move into shallower water (where the water depth is less than half the wavelength), the wave speed becomes dependent on the water depth \(h\):
     $$
     c = \sqrt{gh}
     $$
     As the water depth decreases, the wave speed decreases, causing the wavelength to shorten.

2. **Conservation of Energy Flux**:
   - **Energy Flux**: The energy transported by a wave is given by the wave energy flux, which is the product of wave energy per unit area \(E\) and the group velocity \(c_g\). For deep water waves, this is expressed as:
     $$
     F = E \cdot c_g
     $$
   - **Shoaling Effect**: As waves move into shallower water, the decrease in wave speed (group velocity) must be compensated by an increase in wave height to conserve energy flux. This leads to the phenomenon of wave shoaling, where wave height \(H\) increases as the water depth decreases.

3. **Wave Height Increase**:
   - **Shoaling Coefficient**: The increase in wave height due to shoaling is quantified by the shoaling coefficient \(K_s\), which is the ratio of the wave height in shallow water to that in deep water:
     $$
     K_s = \sqrt{\frac{c_0}{c}}
     $$
     where \(c_0\) is the wave speed in deep water, and \(c\) is the wave speed in shallow water. As the depth decreases, \(c\) decreases, leading to an increase in \(K_s\) and, consequently, wave height.

4. **Wave Breaking**:
   - **Critical Wave Height**: As waves continue to shoal and increase in height, they eventually reach a critical point where they become unstable and break. This occurs when the wave steepness, defined as the ratio of wave height to wavelength (\(H/L\)), exceeds a certain threshold.
   - **Types of Wave Breaking**: The manner in which a wave breaks depends on the slope of the seabed and the wave characteristics. Common types of breaking waves include:
     - **Spilling**: Waves break gently, with the crest spilling forward, common on gently sloping beaches.
     - **Plunging**: Waves curl over and crash down with force, typical on steeper beaches.
     - **Surging**: Waves do not break fully but instead surge up the beach, common on very steep shorelines.

### Factors Affecting Wave Shoaling

1. **Water Depth**:
   - The primary factor influencing wave shoaling is the change in water depth as waves move from deeper to shallower areas. The shallower the water, the more pronounced the shoaling effect, leading to greater increases in wave height.

2. **Wave Period**:
   - Waves with longer periods (greater distances between successive wave crests) tend to shoal more gradually than those with shorter periods. Longer period waves, such as [[swells]], can produce larger waves upon shoaling due to their greater energy.

3. **Seafloor Slope**:
   - The slope of the seafloor plays a critical role in wave shoaling. On gently sloping seabeds, waves shoal gradually, leading to spilling breakers. On steeper slopes, the shoaling occurs more abruptly, often resulting in plunging or surging breakers.

4. **Wave Refraction**:
   - As waves approach the shore at an angle, different parts of the wavefront encounter shallower water at different times, causing the wave to bend or refract. This can lead to focusing of wave energy in certain areas, enhancing shoaling and wave height in those regions.

5. **Bottom Friction and Vegetation**:
   - Bottom friction, caused by the interaction of the wave with the seafloor, and the presence of underwater vegetation like seagrasses, can dissipate wave energy and reduce the shoaling effect, leading to smaller increases in wave height.

### Implications of Wave Shoaling

1. **Coastal Erosion**:
   - The increase in wave height due to shoaling contributes significantly to coastal erosion. As waves break with more energy, they can remove sand and sediment from beaches, reshaping coastlines and potentially leading to the loss of land.

2. **Surfing**:
   - Wave shoaling is a critical factor in the formation of surfable waves. Surfers seek areas where waves shoal and break in predictable patterns, creating the ideal conditions for riding waves. The interaction of wave period, seafloor slope, and water depth determines the quality of surf breaks.

3. **Coastal Protection**:
   - Understanding wave shoaling is essential for designing coastal protection structures such as breakwaters, seawalls, and groynes. These structures must be engineered to withstand the increased wave energy that results from shoaling.

4. **Navigation and Maritime Safety**:
   - Shoaling can create hazards for ships, particularly in areas where the seabed rises rapidly, causing waves to increase in height suddenly. Mariners need to be aware of shoaling effects, especially when navigating near coastlines or over submerged shoals and sandbars.

5. **Tsunami and Storm Surge Impact**:
   - During tsunamis and storm surges, wave shoaling can significantly amplify the height of incoming waves, leading to greater inundation and damage in coastal areas. Predicting the extent of shoaling is crucial for early warning systems and disaster preparedness.

### Conclusion

**Wave shoaling** is a fundamental process in coastal [[hydrodynamics]], describing how waves increase in height as they move into shallower waters. This process is essential for understanding and predicting wave behavior near coastlines, influencing everything from coastal erosion and sediment transport to surfing conditions and the design of coastal infrastructure. By studying wave shoaling and the factors that affect it, oceanographers, engineers, and coastal managers can better predict and mitigate the impacts of waves on coastal environments and human activities.
