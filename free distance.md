Free Distance

### Free Distance

The free distance, denoted as \(d_f\), is a critical parameter in the performance of convolutional codes. It is analogous to the minimum Hamming distance in block codes, providing a measure of the error-correcting capability of the convolutional code.

#### Definition

The free distance \(d_f\) of a convolutional code is defined as the minimum Hamming distance between any two distinct paths through the trellis diagram of the code, starting from the same state and ending at the same state (including the starting state if the trellis is terminated).

Mathematically, if \(\mathbf{v}_1\) and \(\mathbf{v}_2\) are two distinct code sequences produced by the convolutional encoder, the free distance is given by:
$$ d_f = \min_{\mathbf{v}_1 \neq \mathbf{v}_2} d_H(\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2), $$
where \(d_H(\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2)\) denotes the Hamming distance between \(\mathbf{v}_1\) and \(\mathbf{v}_2\).

#### Importance

1. **Error-Correcting Capability**
   - The free distance determines the maximum number of errors that can be corrected by the convolutional code. A larger free distance generally implies better error correction performance.

2. **Performance Metric**
   - The error performance of a convolutional code, particularly the bit error rate (BER) and the frame error rate (FER), is closely related to the free distance. Codes with a higher free distance typically exhibit lower error rates under the same conditions.

#### Calculation of Free Distance

To calculate the free distance, we analyze the trellis diagram of the convolutional code:

1. **Trellis Diagram**
   - The trellis diagram represents the state transitions of the convolutional encoder. Each path through the trellis corresponds to a possible output sequence.

2. **State Transitions**
   - Examine all possible pairs of paths that diverge from a common state and remerge at a later state, including returning to the initial state.

3. **Hamming Distance**
   - For each pair of paths, calculate the Hamming distance between the corresponding output sequences. The free distance is the smallest of these distances.

#### Example

Consider a rate \(1/2\) convolutional code with generator polynomials \(g_1(D) = 1 + D + D^2\) and \(g_2(D) = 1 + D^2\):

1. **Generator Polynomials**
   - The generator polynomials define the output sequences based on the input bit and the previous bits stored in the shift registers.

2. **State Diagram**
   - The state diagram for this code can be constructed with 4 states, as the memory \(m = 2\).

3. **Trellis Analysis**
   - Analyze the trellis to find the paths corresponding to different input sequences. Calculate the Hamming distances for these paths.

For this code, let's denote the states by \((S_0, S_1)\), where \(S_0\) and \(S_1\) are the bits in the shift registers. Each state transition is determined by the current input bit and the current state.

Let's examine the paths starting from the all-zero state \((0,0)\):

- **Path 1**: Input sequence \(u = 00\), output sequence \(v = (11, 00)\)
- **Path 2**: Input sequence \(u = 10\), output sequence \(v = (11, 01)\)

The Hamming distance between the output sequences of Path 1 and Path 2 is:
$$ d_H((11, 00), (11, 01)) = 1. $$

We need to examine all such pairs of diverging and remerging paths. For simplicity, we continue with the example paths:

- **Path 3**: Input sequence \(u = 01\), output sequence \(v = (00, 11)\)
- **Path 4**: Input sequence \(u = 11\), output sequence \(v = (01, 11)\)

The Hamming distance between the output sequences of Path 3 and Path 4 is:
$$ d_H((00, 11), (01, 11)) = 1. $$

In this example, the minimum Hamming distance observed is 1. However, real convolutional codes typically have larger free distances.

In practice, the free distance is computed using automated tools or specific algorithms designed to traverse the trellis and identify the minimum Hamming distance among all distinct paths.

#### Applications

1. **Digital Communications**
   - Convolutional codes with a higher free distance are preferred for use in digital communication systems, including wireless communications, satellite communications, and deep-space communications, to enhance error correction performance.

2. **Data Storage**
   - In storage systems, convolutional codes help protect data integrity by correcting errors that occur during data retrieval.

3. **Multimedia Transmission**
   - Applications such as mobile video streaming and digital broadcasting use convolutional codes to ensure reliable transmission of multimedia content.

In summary, the free distance is a crucial parameter that determines the error-correcting performance of convolutional codes. It provides a measure of the code's robustness against errors and is essential for designing reliable communication and storage systems.
