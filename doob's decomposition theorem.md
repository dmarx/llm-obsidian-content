Doob's Decomposition Theorem

### Doob's Decomposition Theorem

**Doob's Decomposition Theorem** is a fundamental result in the theory of stochastic processes, specifically for submartingales. The theorem provides a way to decompose any submartingale into the sum of a martingale and an increasing predictable process. This decomposition is useful in various applications, including financial mathematics and stochastic analysis.

### Statement of Doob's Decomposition Theorem

Let \( \{X_t\}_{t \geq 0} \) be a submartingale with respect to a filtration \( \{ \mathcal{F}_t \} \). Then, \( X_t \) can be uniquely decomposed as:

$$
X_t = M_t + A_t,
$$

where:
- \( \{M_t\}_{t \geq 0} \) is a martingale with respect to \( \{ \mathcal{F}_t \} \).
- \( \{A_t\}_{t \geq 0} \) is a right-continuous, non-decreasing, predictable process with \( A_0 = 0 \).

### Interpretation

Doob's Decomposition Theorem states that any submartingale can be viewed as a combination of two distinct parts:
1. A martingale part \( M_t \) that captures the "fair game" component, where the future expected value is equal to the current value.
2. An increasing part \( A_t \) that captures the cumulative drift or trend over time.

### Proof Sketch

The proof of Doob's Decomposition Theorem involves the following steps:

1. **Construction of \( A_t \)**: Define \( A_t \) as the compensator of the submartingale \( X_t \). This involves constructing \( A_t \) such that \( X_t - A_t \) is a martingale.
2. **Verification of Properties**: Show that \( A_t \) is predictable, non-decreasing, and right-continuous.
3. **Uniqueness**: Prove that the decomposition is unique by showing that any other decomposition would violate the martingale property or the predictability of \( A_t \).

### Applications

#### 1. **Financial Mathematics**

In finance, submartingales often model the price processes of certain assets. The decomposition helps in separating the "fair game" part of the price from the part representing trends or drifts. This is useful for understanding the behavior of asset prices and for constructing hedging strategies.

#### 2. **Optimal Stopping Problems**

Doob's Decomposition Theorem is useful in optimal stopping problems, where the goal is to maximize the expected payoff by choosing an optimal stopping time. The decomposition helps in identifying the stopping rule by analyzing the martingale and the increasing process separately.

### Example

Consider a submartingale \( X_t \) given by:

$$
X_t = B_t + t,
$$

where \( B_t \) is a standard Brownian motion. We can decompose \( X_t \) as follows:

1. **Martingale Part**: \( M_t = B_t \).
2. **Increasing Process**: \( A_t = t \).

Thus, \( X_t = B_t + t \) is decomposed into a martingale \( B_t \) and an increasing predictable process \( t \).

### Detailed Example: Exponential Submartingale

Consider the process \( X_t = e^{\sigma W_t + (\mu - \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2) t} \), where \( W_t \) is a standard Brownian motion, \( \sigma > 0 \), and \( \mu \in \mathbb{R} \).

1. **Logarithm Transformation**: Let \( Y_t = \ln X_t \), so \( Y_t = \sigma W_t + (\mu - \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2) t \).

2. **Decomposition of \( Y_t \)**:
   \[
   Y_t = \sigma W_t + (\mu - \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2) t.
   \]

3. **Martingale Part**: The martingale part is \( \sigma W_t \).

4. **Increasing Process**: The increasing process is \( (\mu - \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2) t \).

Thus, the decomposition of \( X_t \) is:

\[
X_t = \exp(\sigma W_t + (\mu - \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2) t) = \exp(M_t + A_t).
\]

### Conclusion

Doob's Decomposition Theorem provides a powerful tool for analyzing submartingales by breaking them into a martingale and an increasing process. This decomposition has wide-ranging applications in finance, [[optimal stopping theory]], and stochastic process analysis. Understanding this theorem is essential for anyone working with stochastic models and their applications.
