# Problem of Action Individuation

The [[problem of action individuation]] addresses a fundamental metaphysical question in the [[philosophy of action]]: how should we count, identity, and distinguish actions? This problem has significant implications for our understanding of agency, moral responsibility, and the ontology of action.

## Conceptual Formulation

The problem can be framed as determining the identity conditions for actions:

$$a_1 = a_2 \iff ?$$

What fills the right side of this biconditional is precisely what theories of action individuation attempt to specify.

## Competing Approaches

### Fine-Grained View (Goldman)

Alvin Goldman's fine-grained approach in "A Theory of Human Action" (1970) holds that:

$$a_1 = a_2 \iff \forall P(P(a_1) \leftrightarrow P(a_2))$$

This strict application of [[Leibniz's Law]] entails that actions with different properties are different actions. Under this view, flipping the switch, turning on the light, and illuminating the room are distinct but related actions.

### Coarse-Grained View (Davidson)

Donald Davidson's coarse-grained approach holds that:

$$a_1 = a_2 \iff a_1 \text{ and } a_2 \text{ are the same bodily movement}$$

For Davidson, actions are identical if they constitute the same primitive physical movement, though they may be described differently. Thus, flipping the switch and turning on the light are the same action under different descriptions.

### Componential View (Thomson)

Judith Thomson proposes that actions have temporal parts:

$$a = \{e_1, e_2, ..., e_n\}$$

Where each $e_i$ is a temporal part of the action $a$. This allows for partial overlap between actions.

## Formal Challenges

### The Problem of Action Proliferation

The fine-grained view faces the challenge of action proliferation:

$$\text{If } a_1 \text{ generates } a_2 \text{ and } a_1 \neq a_2, \text{ then } |\mathcal{A}| \gg n$$

Where $\mathcal{A}$ is the set of actions performed and $n$ is the number of basic bodily movements. This potentially creates an ontologically problematic multiplication of entities.

### The Problem of Co-location

The coarse-grained view faces the problem of co-location:

$$\text{If } a_1 = a_2 \text{ but } P(a_1) \land \neg P(a_2), \text{ then how can } a_1 = a_2?$$

How can the same action both have and not have a particular property?

## Criteria for Individuation

### Spatiotemporal Criteria

One approach uses spatiotemporal coordinates:

$$a_1 = a_2 \iff \text{SpaceTime}(a_1) = \text{SpaceTime}(a_2)$$

Where $\text{SpaceTime}(a)$ represents the spatiotemporal region occupied by action $a$.

### Causal Criteria

Another approach uses causal profiles:

$$a_1 = a_2 \iff \forall e(\text{Causes}(a_1, e) \leftrightarrow \text{Causes}(a_2, e)) \land \forall e(\text{CausedBy}(a_1, e) \leftrightarrow \text{CausedBy}(a_2, e))$$

### Intentional Criteria

A third approach uses intentional content:

$$a_1 = a_2 \iff \exists i(i \text{ intended } a_1 \iff i \text{ intended } a_2)$$

## The Level-Generation Relation

Goldman's [[level-generation]] relation provides a way to relate distinct but connected actions:

$$\text{LevelGenerates}(a_1, a_2) \iff \text{By doing } a_1 \text{ the agent does } a_2$$

This can be further specified into different types:
- **Causal generation**: $a_1$ causes some event that makes $a_2$ an action
- **Conventional generation**: $a_1$ counts as $a_2$ by convention or rule
- **Simple generation**: $a_1$ constitutes $a_2$ in the circumstances
- **Augmentation generation**: $a_2$ is $a_1$ with some feature added

## Implications for Moral Philosophy

The individuation problem directly affects how we assign moral properties to actions:

$$\text{If } a_1 = a_2 \text{ and } \text{Wrong}(a_1), \text{ then } \text{Wrong}(a_2)$$

But if $a_1 \neq a_2$, we might have:

$$\text{Wrong}(a_1) \land \neg\text{Wrong}(a_2)$$

This has significant implications for:
- The [[Doctrine of Double Effect]]
- The [[Doing vs. Allowing Distinction]]
- [[Consequentialism]] vs. [[Deontology]] debates

## Epistemological Dimensions

The individuation problem also has epistemological aspects:

$$\text{Knows}(S, a) \stackrel{?}{\implies} \forall d(\text{DescriptionOf}(d, a) \implies \text{Knows}(S, d(a)))$$

Can an agent know what they are doing under one description while being ignorant of what they are doing under another description?

## Action Individuation in Language

Natural language reflects the complexity of action individuation:

$$\text{LinguisticForm}(a) \neq \text{MetaphysicalStructure}(a)$$

The linguistic representations of actions may not directly map onto their metaphysical structure, creating additional complexity.

## Contemporary Developments

### Minimalist Approaches

Some contemporary theorists propose minimalist approaches:

$$a_1 = a_2 \iff \text{MinimalDescription}(a_1) = \text{MinimalDescription}(a_2)$$

Where $\text{MinimalDescription}(a)$ is the most basic adequate characterization of the action.

### Pluralist Approaches

Pluralist approaches suggest that different individuation criteria may be appropriate in different contexts:

$$\text{IndividuationCriteria} = f(\text{Context}, \text{Purpose}, \text{Domain})$$

## Research Frontiers

Current research explores:
- Connections between action individuation and [[event semantics]]
- The role of [[extended actions]] that unfold over time
- Implications for understanding [[group agency]] and [[collective action]]
- Computational approaches to action representation
- Cross-cultural perspectives on action individuation

## Philosophical Significance

The problem of action individuation has broad philosophical significance, connecting to:
- The [[metaphysics of events]]
- Theories of [[personal identity]]
- Questions about [[moral responsibility]]
- Issues in [[philosophy of mind]] regarding intention
- Debates in [[philosophy of language]] about action description
