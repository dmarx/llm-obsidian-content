how do the theories underlying DBT and ACT relate to SDT


**ASSISTANT**

**Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)** and **Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)** are both forms of psychotherapy that share certain philosophical and therapeutic principles with **Self-Determination Theory (SDT)**, especially regarding how individuals approach psychological well-being, autonomy, and intrinsic motivation. While DBT and ACT were developed independently of SDT, they contain underlying concepts that align with the principles of SDT, such as the emphasis on autonomy, self-acceptance, and the integration of values into daily actions.

### Overview of DBT and ACT

- **Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)**: Developed by Marsha Linehan, DBT is primarily aimed at helping individuals regulate emotions, tolerate distress, and improve interpersonal effectiveness. It involves skills training in four key areas: mindfulness, emotional regulation, distress tolerance, and interpersonal effectiveness. The therapy focuses on the dialectical process of accepting oneself as they are while simultaneously working toward positive change.

- **Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)**: Created by Steven Hayes, ACT encourages individuals to accept their thoughts and feelings without attempting to change them, while committing to actions that align with their values. The central tenets of ACT include mindfulness, acceptance, cognitive defusion (separating oneself from thoughts), values clarification, and committed action.

### Relationship Between DBT, ACT, and SDT

#### 1. Emphasis on Autonomy and Self-Acceptance

**SDT** posits that autonomy—feeling in control of one’s actions—is essential for intrinsic motivation and psychological well-being. Both DBT and ACT align with this concept through their focus on **self-acceptance** and the development of skills that support autonomous functioning.

- **DBT** emphasizes the dialectical balance between **acceptance** and **change**. It acknowledges the importance of accepting oneself and one’s emotions (reflecting an acceptance of autonomy) while simultaneously striving for change. By teaching individuals to regulate emotions and tolerate distress, DBT promotes the ability to make autonomous decisions in alignment with one's values, rather than being driven by impulsive, emotionally reactive behaviors. This is similar to SDT's assertion that autonomy support leads to greater self-regulation and psychological well-being.

- **ACT** explicitly focuses on **acceptance** and **values-based action**. It encourages individuals to accept their internal experiences (thoughts, feelings, sensations) without judgment and to choose actions aligned with their deeply held values. This approach fosters **autonomy** by helping individuals identify what matters to them and commit to those values, which aligns with SDT’s concept of **intrinsic motivation**. In SDT, behaviors driven by intrinsic motivation or identified regulation (where an individual recognizes the importance of a behavior and adopts it as their own) are more autonomous and self-determined. Similarly, ACT's process of clarifying values and committing to them reflects this movement toward self-determined action.

#### 2. Fostering Intrinsic Motivation

SDT emphasizes that the satisfaction of basic psychological needs—**autonomy**, **competence**, and **relatedness**—enhances intrinsic motivation. Both DBT and ACT incorporate elements that support these needs:

- **Autonomy**: 
  - In **DBT**, the focus on **mindfulness** allows individuals to observe their thoughts and feelings non-judgmentally, enhancing self-awareness and promoting autonomy in choosing how to respond to emotions. The skills training in DBT helps individuals act according to their long-term goals and values, rather than reacting impulsively to short-term emotional states. This aligns with SDT's view that autonomy involves acting in harmony with one's true self and values.
  - **ACT** places a strong emphasis on values clarification, where individuals identify what is most important to them. By encouraging acceptance of internal experiences (rather than attempting to control or suppress them) and committing to values-based actions, ACT supports the development of **autonomous motivation**. This is similar to SDT's **identified** and **integrated regulation**, where individuals adopt behaviors because they align with their core values and self-concept.

- **Competence**: 
  - In **DBT**, skills training in areas like distress tolerance, emotional regulation, and interpersonal effectiveness enhances individuals' sense of **competence**. By learning and practicing these skills, individuals develop the ability to manage their lives more effectively, which in turn supports intrinsic motivation as outlined in SDT.
  - **ACT** fosters competence by teaching **psychological flexibility**—the ability to stay present, accept thoughts and feelings, and choose actions that align with one's values. This flexibility builds confidence in one’s ability to handle diverse life challenges, contributing to a sense of competence in navigating complex internal and external experiences.

- **Relatedness**: 
  - **DBT** incorporates an emphasis on **interpersonal effectiveness**, aiming to improve relationships and foster a sense of connection and understanding. The validation strategies used in DBT help individuals feel understood and connected, addressing the SDT need for **relatedness**.
  - **ACT** may not explicitly focus on relatedness in the same way as DBT, but the process of values clarification often involves identifying values related to relationships and social connections. By committing to actions that strengthen relationships, individuals fulfill the need for relatedness, thereby supporting intrinsic motivation.

#### 3. Addressing Psychological Flexibility and Authenticity

- **ACT**'s concept of **psychological flexibility**—the ability to adapt to changing circumstances, remain mindful, and align actions with core values—is closely related to the **autonomy orientation** described in SDT's [[Causality Orientation]]. Individuals with an autonomy orientation are more likely to regulate their behavior in a way that aligns with their authentic values and self-concept. ACT's therapeutic goal of helping individuals accept internal experiences and commit to value-driven actions echoes the internalization process in SDT, where individuals adopt external goals or values as their own, leading to more integrated and self-determined forms of motivation.

- **DBT** promotes a similar form of authenticity through its emphasis on **mindfulness** and dialectical thinking (holding two seemingly opposite ideas in balance). By teaching individuals to observe their thoughts and emotions without judgment, DBT helps them become more aware of their true desires and values, promoting autonomous decision-making. This supports SDT's notion that a deeper connection with one’s self and intrinsic desires is key to maintaining authentic motivation and psychological well-being.

### Summary of Relationships

- **DBT and ACT's Emphasis on Values**: Both DBT and ACT encourage individuals to identify and act in accordance with their values, a process that aligns with SDT's focus on **autonomous motivation** and the internalization of values as a means to achieve self-determination and well-being.

- **Self-Acceptance and Autonomy**: The emphasis in DBT and ACT on accepting internal experiences (thoughts, emotions, and sensations) is crucial for autonomy support, as described in SDT. Acceptance allows individuals to make choices based on authentic desires rather than external pressures, enhancing their self-determination.

- **Skills Training and Competence**: DBT’s skills training and ACT’s focus on psychological flexibility build individuals' competence, which is a basic psychological need in SDT that fosters more intrinsic forms of motivation.

In essence, **DBT** and **ACT** promote the development of psychological skills and attitudes (such as mindfulness, acceptance, values-based action, and emotional regulation) that align with the principles of SDT. By facilitating autonomy, competence, and relatedness, these therapeutic approaches help individuals move toward more self-determined, intrinsic forms of motivation, leading to greater psychological well-being.
