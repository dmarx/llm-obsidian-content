Lie–Cartan theorem


**ASSISTANT**

The **Lie–Cartan theorem** is a fundamental result in the theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras. Named after [[Sophus Lie]] and [[Élie Cartan]], this theorem establishes a crucial relationship between the local properties of Lie groups and their associated Lie algebras.

### Statement of the Lie–Cartan Theorem

The theorem can be stated as follows:

*Let \(G\) be a connected Lie group and let \(\mathfrak{g}\) be its corresponding Lie algebra. Then, there exists a one-to-one correspondence between the Lie subalgebras of \(\mathfrak{g}\) and the connected Lie subgroups of \(G\).*

More formally, if \(\mathfrak{h}\) is a Lie subalgebra of \(\mathfrak{g}\), there exists a unique connected Lie subgroup \(H\) of \(G\) such that the Lie algebra of \(H\) is \(\mathfrak{h}\).

### Detailed Explanation

#### Lie Groups and Lie Algebras

A **Lie group** \(G\) is a group that is also a differentiable manifold, with the group operations (multiplication and inversion) being smooth maps. The **Lie algebra** \(\mathfrak{g}\) of a Lie group \(G\) is the tangent space at the identity element \(e\) of \(G\), equipped with a binary operation called the **Lie bracket**, which is a bilinear, antisymmetric map:

$$
[\cdot, \cdot] : \mathfrak{g} \times \mathfrak{g} \to \mathfrak{g}
$$

satisfying the Jacobi identity:

$$
[x, [y, z]] + [y, [z, x]] + [z, [x, y]] = 0 \quad \text{for all} \quad x, y, z \in \mathfrak{g}.
$$

#### Correspondence between Subalgebras and Subgroups

1. **Lie Subalgebras**: A Lie subalgebra \(\mathfrak{h}\) of \(\mathfrak{g}\) is a vector subspace of \(\mathfrak{g}\) that is closed under the Lie bracket. 

2. **Lie Subgroups**: A Lie subgroup \(H\) of \(G\) is a subgroup that is also an embedded submanifold of \(G\), meaning that the inclusion map \(H \hookrightarrow G\) is an immersion.

The theorem asserts that every Lie subalgebra \(\mathfrak{h}\) of \(\mathfrak{g}\) corresponds to a unique connected Lie subgroup \(H\) of \(G\) such that the Lie algebra of \(H\) is \(\mathfrak{h}\). This provides a powerful link between the algebraic structure of \(\mathfrak{g}\) and the geometric structure of \(G\).

### Proof Outline

The proof of the Lie–Cartan theorem involves several steps:

1. **Exponentiation**: Construct the Lie subgroup \(H\) corresponding to a given Lie subalgebra \(\mathfrak{h}\) by using the exponential map \(\exp: \mathfrak{g} \to G\). The exponential map relates the Lie algebra to the Lie group by mapping elements of \(\mathfrak{g}\) to \(G\) in a way that respects the group structure locally.

2. **Uniqueness**: Show that this construction is unique by demonstrating that any connected Lie subgroup with the same Lie algebra must coincide with \(H\).

3. **Connectedness**: Ensure that the subgroup \(H\) constructed is indeed connected, leveraging the connectedness of the original group \(G\) and properties of the exponential map.

### Applications

The Lie–Cartan theorem is fundamental in the study of the structure and representation of Lie groups and Lie algebras. It allows for the translation of problems in differential geometry and group theory into the realm of linear algebra, where they can often be more easily solved. Specific applications include:

- **Classification of Lie Groups**: Understanding the subgroups of a given Lie group by studying its Lie algebra.
- **Representation Theory**: Decomposing representations of Lie groups by analyzing representations of their Lie algebras.
- **Differential Geometry**: Studying the symmetry properties of manifolds by examining their associated Lie groups and algebras.
