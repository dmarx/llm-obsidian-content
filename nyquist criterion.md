### Nyquist Criterion

The Nyquist Criterion is a graphical method in control theory used to determine the stability of a closed-loop control system by analyzing the open-loop frequency response. It leverages the principles of complex analysis and is particularly useful for systems described by transfer functions in the frequency domain.

#### 1. **Basic Concepts**

The Nyquist Criterion is based on the Nyquist plot, which is a polar plot of the open-loop transfer function \( L(s) = G(s)H(s) \) as the frequency \( \omega \) varies from \(-\infty\) to \(+\infty\). Here, \( G(s) \) represents the plant transfer function and \( H(s) \) represents the controller transfer function.

##### Key Definitions:

- **Open-Loop Transfer Function**: \( L(s) = G(s)H(s) \)
- **Closed-Loop Transfer Function**: \( T(s) = \frac{G(s)H(s)}{1 + G(s)H(s)} \)
- **Characteristic Equation**: \( 1 + G(s)H(s) = 0 \)

#### 2. **Nyquist Plot**

The Nyquist plot is a parametric plot of \( L(j\omega) \) in the complex plane, where \( \omega \) varies from \(-\infty\) to \(+\infty\).

To create a Nyquist plot:
1. Calculate the open-loop transfer function \( L(j\omega) \).
2. Plot \( L(j\omega) \) in the complex plane as \( \omega \) varies from \(-\infty\) to \(+\infty\).

#### 3. **Nyquist Criterion**

The Nyquist Criterion determines the stability of the closed-loop system by analyzing how the Nyquist plot encircles the critical point \(-1 + j0\) in the complex plane.

##### Stability Rule:

For a system with \( P \) poles of \( L(s) \) in the right-half plane (RHP):
- The number of clockwise encirclements \( N \) of the point \(-1 + j0 \) by the Nyquist plot must be equal to the number of RHP poles \( P \) of \( L(s) \) minus the number of RHP zeros \( Z \) of \( 1 + L(s) \):

$$
N = P - Z
$$

For the system to be stable, the number of RHP zeros \( Z \) must be zero, meaning:

$$
N = P
$$

#### 4. **Interpreting the Nyquist Plot**

- **No Encirclements of \(-1 + j0\)**: If the Nyquist plot does not encircle \(-1 + j0\), the closed-loop system is stable if there are no RHP poles in the open-loop transfer function.
- **Clockwise Encirclements**: Each clockwise encirclement of \(-1 + j0\) indicates an additional RHP zero of \( 1 + L(s) \), which corresponds to an unstable pole of the closed-loop system.
- **Counter-Clockwise Encirclements**: Each counter-clockwise encirclement can indicate the presence of stable poles and must be carefully interpreted in conjunction with the open-loop pole locations.

#### 5. **Example**

Consider an open-loop transfer function:

$$
L(s) = \frac{K}{s(s+2)(s+4)},
$$

where \( K \) is the system gain.

##### Step-by-Step Nyquist Plot and Stability Analysis:

1. **Open-Loop Transfer Function**:

$$
L(j\omega) = \frac{K}{j\omega (j\omega + 2)(j\omega + 4)}
$$

2. **Frequency Response**:

Evaluate \( L(j\omega) \) for a range of \( \omega \):

For \( \omega = 0 \):

$$
L(j0) = \frac{K}{0 \cdot 2 \cdot 4} = \infty \quad \text{(undefined, handle carefully in the plot)}
$$

For \( \omega = \infty \):

$$
L(j\infty) = \frac{K}{j\infty \cdot (j\infty + 2)(j\infty + 4)} = 0
$$

3. **Plotting \( L(j\omega) \)**:

Plot \( L(j\omega) \) as \( \omega \) ranges from \(-\infty\) to \(+\infty\) in the complex plane. For typical values, this involves evaluating \( L(j\omega) \) at several frequencies and plotting the resulting complex numbers.

4. **Analyzing Encirclements**:

- Identify the critical point \(-1 + j0\) on the plot.
- Count the number of clockwise encirclements of \(-1 + j0\).

Assume the Nyquist plot does not encircle \(-1 + j0\). If the system has no RHP poles (\( P = 0 \)):

$$
N = P - Z = 0 - 0 = 0
$$

Thus, the closed-loop system is stable.

#### 6. **Special Cases**

##### Gain Margin and Phase Margin

- **Gain Margin (GM)**: The factor by which the system gain can be increased before it becomes unstable. It is determined by the inverse of the magnitude of \( L(j\omega) \) at the phase crossover frequency (where the phase is \(-180^\circ\)).
- **Phase Margin (PM)**: The additional phase lag required to bring the system to the verge of instability. It is the phase difference between \(-180^\circ\) and the phase of \( L(j\omega) \) at the gain crossover frequency (where \( |L(j\omega)| = 1 \)).

##### Nyquist Criterion for Systems with Poles on Imaginary Axis

For systems with poles on the imaginary axis (e.g., integrators), a small semicircle is used to detour around the pole on the Nyquist plot, ensuring a continuous contour without passing through infinity.

### Conclusion

The Nyquist Criterion provides a robust graphical method for assessing the stability of a closed-loop control system by examining the frequency response of its open-loop transfer function. By analyzing the encirclements of the critical point \(-1 + j0\) in the complex plane, engineers can determine the stability margins and robustness of control systems, making it a vital tool in control theory and engineering applications.
