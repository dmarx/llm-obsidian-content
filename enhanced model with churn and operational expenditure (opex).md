title: enhanced model with churn and operational expenditure (opex)
---

**USER**

how about this: let's add a "churn" component to the model. so an employee's starting salary will be governed by G(q,0), and then their salary after an employment duration of `t` can increase by some parameterizable factor. let `G(.,t) = G(.,0) + H(r, t, G(.,0))` where `r` is some growth factor. an employee "churns" conditional upon the relationship between their salary and their market earning potential according to the market. For simplicity's sake, let's say their market earning potential is given by `G(.,t) = G(.,0) + H(s, t, G(.,0))`, so `s/r` can be interpreted as a measure of labor exploitation on the part of the company. individual employees can be subject to a churn likelihood governed by the degree to which they are being exploited, so conversely employees who are making more than they are worth in the market will be less likely to churn. the incentive to reduce operational expenditure should act as a pressure on the distribution over employee exploitations, such that exploitation is distributed according to a powerlaw with most employees being more exploited as the company gets larger and is incentivized to concentrate wealth across fewer employees to reduce opex. I feel like this model is still missing a component to make this work. some kind of per-employee opex cost maybe

### Enhanced Model with Churn and Operational Expenditure (Opex)

Let's incorporate the components you've described into a coherent model that includes salary growth, market earning potential, churn likelihood, and operational expenditure. The goal is to illustrate the emergence of phase transitions in company priorities as the company grows.

### Model Components

1. **Initial Salary Distribution**:
   \[
   s_i \sim G(q, 0)
   \]
   where \(s_i\) is the starting salary of employee \(i\).

2. **Salary Growth Over Time**:
   \[
   s_i(t) = G(q, 0) + H(r, t, G(q, 0))
   \]
   where \(H(r, t, G(q, 0))\) represents the salary growth governed by a growth factor \(r\).

3. **Market Earning Potential**:
   \[
   m_i(t) = G(q, 0) + H(s, t, G(q, 0))
   \]
   where \(s\) is the growth factor in the market.

4. **Exploitation Measure**:
   \[
   \text{Exploitation}_i = \frac{s_i(t)}{m_i(t)} = \frac{G(q, 0) + H(r, t, G(q, 0))}{G(q, 0) + H(s, t, G(q, 0))}
   \]
   This measure indicates how much an employee is being exploited.

5. **Churn Likelihood**:
   \[
   P_{\text{churn}_i} = f\left(\text{Exploitation}_i\right)
   \]
   where \(f\) is a function that increases with exploitation. Employees with higher exploitation are more likely to churn.

6. **Operational Expenditure (Opex) Per Employee**:
   \[
   \text{Opex}_i = c_i \cdot s_i(t)
   \]
   where \(c_i\) is the cost multiplier for employee \(i\). This could include benefits, equipment, and other costs.

### Hypothesis

As the company grows, the pressure to reduce operational expenditure will result in a skewed salary distribution where most employees are more exploited (i.e., their salaries grow slower relative to market potential), leading to a power-law distribution in exploitation.

### Simulation Framework

1. **Initialization**:
   - Define initial salary distribution \(G(q, 0)\).
   - Set initial headcount \(N = N_0\).

2. **Simulation Steps**:
   - For each timestep \(t\):
     1. **Salary Growth**: Update salaries \(s_i(t)\) for all employees.
     2. **Market Potential**: Update market earning potentials \(m_i(t)\).
     3. **Exploitation Calculation**: Calculate exploitation for each employee.
     4. **Churn Decision**: Determine churn likelihood \(P_{\text{churn}_i}\) based on exploitation.
     5. **Opex Calculation**: Calculate opex per employee.
     6. **Adjust Headcount**: Adjust headcount \(N\) based on churn and hiring.
     7. **Pressure to Reduce Opex**: Adjust salary distribution parameter \(q\) to reflect increased operational pressure as \(N\) grows.

3. **Measure Emergent Properties**:
   - Track changes in salary distribution \(G(q, t)\) over time.
   - Calculate the Gini coefficient to measure income inequality.
   - Observe the distribution of exploitation and identify the phase transition point where the distribution becomes a power-law.

### Detailed Model Components

1. **Initial Salary Distribution**:
   \[
   G(q, 0) = \text{Uniform distribution}
   \]

2. **Salary Growth Function**:
   \[
   H(r, t, G(q, 0)) = r \cdot t \cdot G(q, 0)
   \]
   where \(r\) is a growth factor.

3. **Market Potential Growth Function**:
   \[
   H(s, t, G(q, 0)) = s \cdot t \cdot G(q, 0)
   \]
   where \(s\) is a market growth factor.

4. **Exploitation Calculation**:
   \[
   \text{Exploitation}_i = \frac{s_i(t)}{m_i(t)} = \frac{G(q, 0) + r \cdot t \cdot G(q, 0)}{G(q, 0) + s \cdot t \cdot G(q, 0)} = \frac{1 + r \cdot t}{1 + s \cdot t}
   \]

5. **Churn Likelihood Function**:
   \[
   P_{\text{churn}_i} = \min\left(1, k \cdot (\text{Exploitation}_i - 1)\right)
   \]
   where \(k\) is a proportionality constant. Employees with \( \text{Exploitation}_i > 1 \) are more likely to churn.

6. **Opex Calculation**:
   \[
   \text{Opex}_i = c_i \cdot s_i(t)
   \]

### Example Simulation

1. **Initialization**:
   - \(N_0 = 100\)
   - \(G(q, 0) = \text{Uniform}(50, 150)\)
   - \(r = 0.05\), \(s = 0.03\), \(k = 0.5\), \(c_i = 1.2\)

2. **Timestep Updates**:
   - For \(t = 1, 2, \ldots, T\):
     - **Update Salaries**:
       \[
       s_i(t) = G(q, 0) + r \cdot t \cdot G(q, 0)
       \]
     - **Update Market Potential**:
       \[
       m_i(t) = G(q, 0) + s \cdot t \cdot G(q, 0)
       \]
     - **Calculate Exploitation**:
       \[
       \text{Exploitation}_i = \frac{1 + r \cdot t}{1 + s \cdot t}
       \]
     - **Determine Churn Likelihood**:
       \[
       P_{\text{churn}_i} = \min\left(1, k \cdot \left(\frac{1 + r \cdot t}{1 + s \cdot t} - 1\right)\right)
       \]
     - **Calculate Opex**:
       \[
       \text{Opex}_i = c_i \cdot s_i(t)
       \]
     - **Adjust Headcount**:
       - Remove employees based on churn likelihood.
       - Hire new employees with starting salaries from \(G(q, 0)\).
     - **Adjust Salary Distribution Parameter**:
       - As \(N\) grows, increase \(q\) to reflect the pressure to reduce opex, shifting towards a power-law distribution.

3. **Measure and Analyze**:
   - **Track Salary Distribution**: \(G(q, t)\).
   - **Calculate Gini Coefficient**: Measure income inequality over time.
   - **Observe Exploitation Distribution**: Identify phase transition where exploitation distribution becomes power-law.

### Visualization and Results

- **Salary Distribution**: Plot \(G(q, t)\) over time to observe the shift towards power-law.
- **Gini Coefficient**: Plot the Gini coefficient over time to see changes in income inequality.
- **Exploitation Distribution**: Plot the distribution of exploitation to identify the phase transition.

### Summary

This enhanced model incorporates churn and operational expenditure, providing a detailed framework to simulate and analyze the emergence of phase transitions in company priorities as headcount increases. By tracking the evolution of salary distributions, exploitation measures, and income inequality, this model can computationally demonstrate how structural factors influence the company's optimization objectives and lead to emergent behaviors.
