# Entropy Measures for Networks

[[Entropy measures for networks]] are mathematical tools that quantify the complexity, organization, and uncertainty in network structures. These measures extend classical information-theoretic concepts to the domain of complex networks, providing insights into structural properties, dynamical processes, and evolutionary patterns of networked systems.

## Structural Entropy Measures

### Degree Distribution Entropy

The [[degree distribution entropy]] measures the uncertainty in the degrees of nodes:

$$H_D = -\sum_{k} P(k) \log P(k)$$

where $P(k)$ is the probability that a randomly selected node has degree $k$.

Properties:
- Maximum when degree distribution is uniform
- Minimum (zero) for regular graphs where all nodes have identical degree
- Higher values indicate greater heterogeneity in node connectivity

### Von Neumann Entropy

The [[von Neumann entropy]] of a network is derived from quantum information theory:

$$S_V = -\text{Tr}(\rho \log \rho)$$

where $\rho = \frac{L}{2m}$ is the density matrix, $L$ is the Laplacian matrix of the network, and $m$ is the number of edges.

For undirected networks, this can be computed from the eigenvalues $\lambda_i$ of the normalized Laplacian:

$$S_V = -\sum_{i=1}^{n} \lambda_i \log \lambda_i$$

Properties:
- Captures global network structure
- Invariant under graph isomorphism
- Sensitive to structural changes at all scales

### Structural Entropy

The [[structural entropy]] based on the [[graph spectral theory]] is defined as:

$$H_S = -\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{\lambda_i}{\sum_j \lambda_j} \log \frac{\lambda_i}{\sum_j \lambda_j}$$

where $\lambda_i$ are eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix.

### Offdiagonal Complexity

The [[offdiagonal complexity]] measures the heterogeneity of connections between nodes of different degrees:

$$OdC = \sum_{i=1}^{d_{max}-1} |m_i - \bar{m}|$$

where $m_i$ is the number of edges connecting nodes with degrees that differ by $i$, and $\bar{m}$ is the average of these values.

## Random Walk Entropy Measures

### Shannon Entropy Rate

For a random walker on a network, the [[Shannon entropy rate]] measures the uncertainty per step:

$$h = -\sum_{i=1}^{n} \pi_i \sum_{j=1}^{n} P_{ij} \log P_{ij}$$

where $P_{ij}$ is the transition probability from node $i$ to $j$, and $\pi_i$ is the stationary distribution.

For unbiased random walks on undirected networks:

$$h = \log 2 - \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^{n} k_i \log k_i$$

where $k_i$ is the degree of node $i$.

### Path Entropy

The [[path entropy]] quantifies the diversity of paths between node pairs:

$$H_P = -\sum_{i,j} \sum_{\text{paths}} P(s_{ij}) \log P(s_{ij})$$

where $P(s_{ij})$ is the probability of a specific path $s_{ij}$ between nodes $i$ and $j$.

### Transfer Entropy

[[Transfer entropy]] measures the directed flow of information between nodes:

$$T_{X \to Y} = \sum p(y_{t+1}, y_t^{(k)}, x_t^{(l)}) \log \frac{p(y_{t+1} | y_t^{(k)}, x_t^{(l)})}{p(y_{t+1} | y_t^{(k)})}$$

where $y_t^{(k)}$ and $x_t^{(l)}$ represent $k$ and $l$ past states of processes $Y$ and $X$.

## Partition-Based Entropy Measures

### Community Entropy

[[Community entropy]] quantifies the uncertainty in community structure:

$$H_C = -\sum_{c=1}^{C} \frac{n_c}{n} \log \frac{n_c}{n}$$

where $n_c$ is the number of nodes in community $c$, and $C$ is the total number of communities.

### Block Entropy

The [[block entropy]] based on the [[stochastic block model]] is:

$$H_B = -\sum_{r,s} \frac{m_{rs}}{m} \log \frac{m_{rs}}{m}$$

where $m_{rs}$ is the number of edges between blocks $r$ and $s$.

### Hierarchical Entropy

[[Hierarchical entropy]] measures the uncertainty across multiple organizational levels:

$$H_H = \sum_{l=1}^{L} \alpha_l H_l$$

where $H_l$ is the entropy at hierarchical level $l$, and $\alpha_l$ are weighting coefficients.

## Parametric Entropy Generalizations

### Rényi Network Entropy

The [[Rényi network entropy]] of order $\alpha$ is defined as:

$$H_{\alpha}^R = \frac{1}{1-\alpha} \log \sum_{k} [P(k)]^{\alpha}$$

This generalizes the degree distribution entropy, with:
- $\alpha \to 1$: Shannon entropy
- $\alpha \to 0$: Logarithm of the number of distinct degrees
- $\alpha \to \infty$: Negative logarithm of the maximum probability

### Tsallis Network Entropy

The [[Tsallis network entropy]] introduces non-extensivity:

$$S_q = \frac{1}{q-1} \left(1 - \sum_{k} [P(k)]^q \right)$$

Properties:
- Non-extensive: $S_q(A \cup B) \neq S_q(A) + S_q(B)$ for independent networks
- Captures long-range correlations and collective behaviors
- Useful for networks with power-law distributions

## Entropy-Based Network Measures

### Network Efficiency

[[Network efficiency]] relates to the entropy of information flow:

$$E = \frac{1}{n(n-1)} \sum_{i \neq j} \frac{1}{d_{ij}}$$

where $d_{ij}$ is the shortest path length between nodes $i$ and $j$.

### Entropy-Based Centrality

[[Entropy-based centrality]] measures quantify the importance of nodes based on the information content they contribute:

$$C_E(i) = -\sum_{j \neq i} \frac{p_{ij}}{\sum_{k \neq i} p_{ik}} \log \frac{p_{ij}}{\sum_{k \neq i} p_{ik}}$$

where $p_{ij}$ represents some measure of relationship between nodes $i$ and $j$.

### Entropy Rank

The [[entropy rank]] of a network:

$$R_E = \frac{H_D}{H_D^{max}}$$

where $H_D^{max}$ is the maximum possible degree distribution entropy.

## Applications

- Increasing entropy: Diversification phase
- Decreasing entropy: Specialization phase
- Stable entropy: Equilibrium phase

Sudden changes in entropy can indicate:
- [[Network attacks]]
- [[Structural failures]]
- [[Phase transitions]]

- [[Minimum description length]] of network models

## Formalization with Symbolic Notation

To standardize network entropy measures, we define:
- $G = (V, E)$: Network with node set $V$ and edge set $E$
- $n = |V|$: Number of nodes
- $m = |E|$: Number of edges
- $A = [a_{ij}]$: Adjacency matrix
- $L = D - A$: Laplacian matrix, where $D = \text{diag}(k_1, k_2, ..., k_n)$
- $P = [p_{ij}]$: Transition probability matrix, where $p_{ij} = \frac{a_{ij}}{k_i}$
- $\pi = [\pi_1, \pi_2, ..., \pi_n]$: Stationary distribution
- $\mathcal{C} = \{C_1, C_2, ..., C_r\}$: Community partition

With these conventions, entropy measures can be expressed concisely and consistently across different network analyses.
