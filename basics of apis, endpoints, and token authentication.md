### **Basics of APIs, Endpoints, and Token Authentication**

An **API (Application Programming Interface)** allows different software systems to communicate with each other. In the context of web development, **web APIs** enable client applications (like web browsers or mobile apps) to interact with server-side services over the internet. The API defines how requests for certain functionalities or data can be made, and how the server will respond.

In this module, we’ll cover the fundamentals of:
1. **APIs** and their purpose.
2. **Endpoints**, which are specific URLs within the API.
3. **Token-based Authentication**, a common method for securing access to APIs.

### **1. What is an API?**

An **API (Application Programming Interface)** is a set of rules that allows software applications to interact with each other. It defines the **methods** and **data formats** that client systems can use to communicate with server-side services.

APIs are often used in web development to enable interaction between front-end applications (such as websites or mobile apps) and back-end services (such as databases or cloud services). For example:
- A weather app uses an API to retrieve the current weather data from a remote server.
- A payment gateway API allows a web store to process payments without storing credit card information.

#### **Types of APIs**:
- **REST APIs**: A common architecture for web APIs that use HTTP requests to perform actions like retrieving data (`GET`), submitting data (`POST`), updating data (`PUT`), or deleting data (`DELETE`).
- **GraphQL APIs**: An alternative to REST that allows clients to request only the specific data they need, improving efficiency.
- **SOAP APIs**: An older, more structured protocol for web services that relies on XML and more rigid standards.

### **2. Endpoints in an API**

An **endpoint** is a specific URL within an API where a particular resource or service is made available. Each endpoint corresponds to a unique **resource** or **functionality** exposed by the API. When a client makes a request to the API, it targets a specific endpoint.

#### **Structure of an Endpoint**:
An endpoint is typically a **URL** (Uniform Resource Locator) that includes the **base URL** of the API and a **path** to the specific resource.

For example, consider a REST API for an online store. The base URL could be:

```
https://api.onlinestore.com/
```

Different endpoints might be available for different resources:
- **Products**: `https://api.onlinestore.com/products`
- **Orders**: `https://api.onlinestore.com/orders`
- **Customers**: `https://api.onlinestore.com/customers`

You can also target specific resources by appending an identifier (like an ID) to the path:
- **Product with ID 123**: `https://api.onlinestore.com/products/123`

#### **HTTP Methods and Endpoints**:
The **HTTP method** (also called the verb) specifies what action to perform on the endpoint. Common HTTP methods include:
- **GET**: Retrieve data from the server (e.g., fetch a list of products).
- **POST**: Send data to the server (e.g., create a new order).
- **PUT**: Update existing data on the server (e.g., update product details).
- **DELETE**: Remove data from the server (e.g., delete a customer record).

**Example of a GET request to an API endpoint**:
```http
GET https://api.onlinestore.com/products
```
This request asks the server for a list of products from the `/products` endpoint.

**Example of a POST request to create a new order**:
```http
POST https://api.onlinestore.com/orders
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "product_id": 123,
  "quantity": 2,
  "customer_id": 456
}
```

### **3. Token-based Authentication**

**Token-based authentication** is a method used to secure APIs, ensuring that only authorized users or applications can access certain endpoints. When a user logs in or when an application connects to the API, a **token** is issued to the client. This token must be included in subsequent API requests to prove that the client is authenticated.

#### **How Token Authentication Works**:

1. **User or Application Requests Token**: The client sends credentials (like a username and password) to the authentication server via an API endpoint.
   - Example: `POST https://api.example.com/login`

2. **Token Issued**: If the credentials are valid, the server responds with a **token** (often a **JWT - JSON Web Token**) that contains encoded information about the user or client.

3. **Token Sent with API Requests**: The client includes this token in the headers of future API requests. The server verifies the token before allowing access to the requested resource.

4. **Server Verifies Token**: The server checks the validity of the token (e.g., if it’s expired or tampered with) and grants or denies access based on the token’s content.

#### **Example Authentication Flow**:

1. **User Requests Token** (Logging In):
```http
POST https://api.example.com/auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "username": "user@example.com",
  "password": "mysecurepassword"
}
```

2. **Server Response with Token**:
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR..."
}
```

3. **Client Makes Authenticated Request**: 
In subsequent requests, the client includes the token in the **Authorization** header.

```http
GET https://api.example.com/orders
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR...
```

The server will validate the token before returning the list of orders.

### **4. JSON Web Token (JWT) for Token Authentication**

A common format for tokens used in API authentication is the **JWT (JSON Web Token)**. It is a compact, URL-safe token format that encodes a set of claims (e.g., user identity, expiration time).

#### **Structure of a JWT**:
A JWT consists of three parts, separated by dots (`.`):
1. **Header**: Contains the type of token (JWT) and the signing algorithm (e.g., HS256).
2. **Payload**: Contains the claims, such as the user’s identity, token expiration, and other metadata.
3. **Signature**: Ensures that the token has not been tampered with, signed using a secret key or public/private key pair.

**Example of a JWT**:
```
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6InVzZXJAZXhhbXBsZS5jb20iLCJleHAiOjE2MTc2MTM2MDB9.NWw4kdx8Y8m2vO-GX7-5i49Qrs1UKMId_3THAz1WnYk
```

#### **How JWT is Used in Token Authentication**:
- The **payload** might include the user ID and an expiration time (`exp` claim), so that the server can check both the identity and whether the token has expired.
- When the client sends the JWT in the **Authorization** header, the server verifies the signature and checks the claims in the payload before allowing access to the API.

### **5. Securing APIs with Token Authentication**

To secure an API with token authentication, follow these general steps:

1. **Authenticate Users**: The API server must have a way to authenticate users or applications and issue a token (e.g., using a login endpoint).
   
2. **Issue Tokens**: Upon successful authentication, issue a signed token (such as a JWT) with the necessary claims (e.g., user ID, expiration time).

3. **Protect Endpoints**: For any sensitive or private endpoint, require that the client sends a valid token in the **Authorization** header.

4. **Verify Tokens**: On each request, the server must:
   - Check that the token is present in the **Authorization** header.
   - Verify the token’s signature and expiration.
   - Optionally, check the claims in the token (e.g., user roles, permissions).

### **Example of Building a Simple API with Token Authentication**

Here is a basic example using Python and **Flask** to build an API that uses token-based authentication with JWT.

#### **Installation**:
```bash
pip install Flask flask-jwt-extended
```

#### **API Code**:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from flask_jwt_extended import JWTManager, create_access_token, jwt_required, get_jwt_identity

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['JWT_SECRET_KEY'] = 'your_secret_key'  # Change this!

jwt = JWTManager(app)

# In-memory user database
users = {
    "user@example.com": {"password": "password123"}
}

# Login endpoint
@app.route('/auth/login', methods=['POST'])
def login():
    email = request.json.get("email")
    password = request.json.get("password")
    
    # Check if the user exists and password matches
    if email in users and users[email]["password"] == password:
        access_token = create_access_token(identity=email)
        return jsonify(access_token=access_token), 200
    else:
        return jsonify({"msg": "Bad email or password"}), 401

# Protected endpoint
@app.route('/orders', methods=['GET'])
@jwt_required()
def orders
