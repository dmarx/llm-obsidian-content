**USER**

maneuver warfare


**ASSISTANT**

**Maneuver warfare** is a military strategy that prioritizes **movement, flexibility, and the exploitation of enemy weaknesses** over direct, attritional combat. The goal is to defeat the enemy by outmaneuvering them—using speed, surprise, and operational creativity to disrupt their decision-making, cohesion, and ability to respond. This approach contrasts with **attrition warfare**, where the aim is to wear down the enemy through continuous, direct engagement.

The core principle of maneuver warfare is to strike at the **enemy’s critical vulnerabilities** (e.g., logistics, command and control, morale), rather than their strongest points, thereby **dislocating** the enemy and forcing them into disadvantageous positions. It involves bypassing fortified defenses, attacking from unexpected directions, and leveraging rapid, mobile forces to keep the enemy off-balance and unable to respond effectively.

### Key Concepts of Maneuver Warfare

1. **Dislocation**:
   - Maneuver warfare seeks to **dislocate** the enemy both physically and psychologically. Physical dislocation involves forcing the enemy out of position, denying them key terrain or cutting off their supply lines. Psychological dislocation refers to disrupting the enemy’s decision-making cycle, making them react to the attacker’s moves rather than controlling the tempo of the battle.
   - The goal is not necessarily to engage the enemy directly at every point but to make their defensive positions irrelevant by **outflanking**, bypassing, or encircling them.

2. **Mission Command**:
   - Maneuver warfare depends heavily on **decentralized command** or **mission command**, where subordinate commanders are given broad objectives and the freedom to determine how to achieve them. This allows for rapid decision-making and the ability to exploit fleeting opportunities on the battlefield.
   - The commander’s intent is critical here—higher-level commanders set the overall goal, but leave the tactical details to subordinate units, enabling them to adapt quickly to changes in the situation.

3. **Speed and Tempo**:
   - **Speed** is crucial in maneuver warfare, both in terms of physical movement and decision-making. By moving faster than the enemy can react, the attacker can keep the initiative and dictate the pace of the battle. This forces the enemy into reactive, often defensive, positions, where they are vulnerable.
   - **Tempo** refers to the pace of operations and the ability to maintain or accelerate this pace to overwhelm the enemy’s decision-making cycle. The idea is to maintain **OODA loop superiority**—meaning the attacker can observe, orient, decide, and act faster than the enemy can react.

4. **Surprise and Deception**:
   - **Surprise** is a critical element of maneuver warfare. By attacking from unexpected directions, at unanticipated times, or using unconventional methods, the attacker can achieve disproportionate effects relative to their actual strength.
   - **Deception** operations, such as feints, decoys, or false intelligence, are often used to mislead the enemy about the true location or objective of an attack. This forces the enemy to allocate resources inefficiently, leaving them vulnerable to the real attack.

5. **Center of Gravity and Critical Vulnerabilities**:
   - In maneuver warfare, the focus is on identifying and attacking the **center of gravity**—the enemy’s key source of strength or the critical capability that allows them to fight effectively. However, instead of directly assaulting this center of gravity (which is often well defended), maneuver warfare aims to attack the **critical vulnerabilities** that support or protect it.
   - These might include **logistics**, **communication networks**, or **command and control nodes**. By disabling these vulnerabilities, the enemy’s overall ability to wage war can collapse, even without a direct confrontation.

6. **Combined Arms**:
   - **Combined arms operations** are essential in maneuver warfare, integrating infantry, armor, artillery, aviation, and other forces in a coordinated attack. The idea is to apply pressure from multiple angles and with different types of force simultaneously, overwhelming the enemy's ability to respond to each threat.
   - For example, infantry might pin down the enemy while tanks outflank them, and air or artillery assets disrupt their supply lines or rear areas.

7. **Exploitation of Initiative**:
   - Once the enemy is dislocated or a breach is made, maneuver warfare focuses on **exploiting the initiative** and maintaining momentum. This can involve pushing through gaps in enemy lines, seizing key terrain, or cutting off retreat routes, all aimed at breaking the enemy’s coherence and will to fight.
   - The key is to act decisively and maintain pressure, preventing the enemy from reorganizing or counterattacking.

### Application of Maneuver Warfare

Maneuver warfare is typically used in **fluid, dynamic environments**, where terrain, mobility, and flexibility provide opportunities to outmaneuver the enemy. It is particularly effective in situations where the enemy is either too slow or too rigid to adapt quickly, or when the attacking force has **technological or mobility superiority**.

#### 1. **Blitzkrieg (World War II)**:
   - The **German Blitzkrieg** strategy during the early stages of World War II is a classic example of maneuver warfare. It combined fast-moving tanks (Panzer divisions), mechanized infantry, and close air support to rapidly penetrate enemy lines and encircle forces.
   - Instead of attacking fortified positions head-on, the Germans bypassed strongpoints, rapidly advancing through weak spots, and cutting off enemy supply and communication lines. This resulted in quick, decisive victories, as seen in the **Fall of France (1940)**.

#### 2. **Desert Storm (1991)**:
   - During **Operation Desert Storm**, U.S.-led coalition forces employed maneuver warfare to defeat Iraqi forces in Kuwait. Rather than engage in prolonged attritional combat, coalition forces used rapid, wide-sweeping flanking movements to bypass heavily fortified Iraqi positions.
   - The "left hook" maneuver, led by armored and mechanized units, penetrated deep into Iraqi defenses, cutting off their retreat and logistical support, forcing a quick collapse of Iraqi forces.

#### 3. **Yom Kippur War (1973)**:
   - During the **Yom Kippur War**, Israeli forces successfully used maneuver warfare principles in their counterattack against Egyptian forces in the Sinai. After halting the Egyptian advance, Israeli forces used mobile armored units to **cross the Suez Canal**, exploit weak points in the Egyptian lines, and encircle the Egyptian Third Army, forcing a ceasefire.

#### 4. **Afghan Guerrilla Tactics (1980s)**:
   - During the Soviet-Afghan War, **Afghan Mujahideen** fighters used maneuver warfare principles—albeit on a much smaller scale—against Soviet forces. Rather than engage the superior Soviet forces directly, the Mujahideen used mobility, terrain, and small, decentralized units to ambush Soviet convoys and attack their logistical supply lines.
   - By leveraging **mountainous terrain** and moving quickly between positions, they were able to outmaneuver the slower, more centralized Soviet forces, contributing to the eventual Soviet withdrawal.

### Maneuver Warfare and the **OODA Loop**

A core theoretical underpinning of maneuver warfare is the concept of the **OODA Loop**, developed by U.S. Air Force Colonel **John Boyd**. OODA stands for **Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act** and represents the decision-making cycle that all combatants go through in response to a dynamic situation. 

- **Observe**: Gather information about the environment, enemy movements, and battlefield conditions.
- **Orient**: Analyze and process this information to form an understanding of the situation.
- **Decide**: Formulate a plan of action based on the analysis.
- **Act**: Execute the plan.

In maneuver warfare, the goal is to **disrupt the enemy’s OODA loop** by acting faster and with more flexibility, forcing them to constantly react to changing circumstances. If the attacker can consistently complete their OODA loop faster than the enemy, they can seize and maintain the initiative, forcing the enemy into reactive and disorganized behavior. This ultimately leads to **decision paralysis** or operational collapse.

### Modern Adaptations of Maneuver Warfare

In contemporary military operations, **maneuver warfare** remains a foundational doctrine but has evolved with the integration of advanced technologies and multi-domain operations. Some modern adaptations include:

1. **Cyber and Electronic Warfare**:
   - Modern maneuver warfare now includes **cyber and electronic warfare** capabilities, where cyberattacks are used to disable the enemy’s command and control systems, disrupt communications, or compromise logistical networks. This achieves a form of **virtual dislocation**, hindering the enemy’s ability to coordinate and respond.

2. **Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)**:
   - **Drones (UAVs)** are increasingly used for reconnaissance, targeting, and even direct strikes in maneuver warfare. They provide real-time battlefield intelligence, allowing commanders to adjust tactics more quickly and exploit emerging opportunities faster than the enemy.

3. **Precision Strike Capabilities**:
   - The use of **precision-guided munitions** allows for pinpoint strikes on key enemy vulnerabilities, such as logistics hubs, command posts, and radar installations. By targeting critical vulnerabilities rather than engaging enemy forces head-on, modern militaries can dislocate the enemy and create gaps for exploitation.

4. **Multi-Domain Operations**:
   - Modern maneuver warfare involves **multi-domain operations**, integrating land, sea, air, space, and cyber domains to create overwhelming and simultaneous pressure on the enemy from multiple angles. By attacking across multiple domains, modern forces can achieve the same dislocation and disruption goals as traditional maneuver warfare but on a more complex, technologically integrated battlefield.
