Dynamic Mode Decomposition


**ASSISTANT**

**Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD)** is a data-driven algorithm used to approximate the Koopman operator, providing insights into the dynamics of complex systems through a spectral decomposition of data. DMD is particularly valuable in extracting dynamic modes and frequencies from time-series data, making it a powerful tool for analyzing fluid flows, structural vibrations, and other dynamical systems.

### Key Concepts

1. **Snapshots**: DMD operates on a sequence of data snapshots collected at different time instances. Each snapshot represents the state of the system at a particular time.
2. **Linear Mapping**: DMD approximates the evolution of these snapshots using a linear operator, capturing the dominant modes and their corresponding growth/decay rates and frequencies.
3. **Koopman Operator Approximation**: DMD approximates the Koopman operator by finding the best-fit linear operator that describes the evolution of the snapshots.

### Mathematical Formalism

Let $\mathbf{x}_0, \mathbf{x}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_{m-1}$ be a sequence of snapshots of the system state, where $\mathbf{x}_k \in \mathbb{R}^n$. These snapshots can be organized into two data matrices:
$$
\mathbf{X} = [\mathbf{x}_0, \mathbf{x}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_{m-2}], \quad \mathbf{X}' = [\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_{m-1}].
$$

The goal of DMD is to find a linear operator $\mathbf{A}$ that approximately maps $\mathbf{X}$ to $\mathbf{X}'$:
$$
\mathbf{X}' \approx \mathbf{A} \mathbf{X}.
$$

### Steps of DMD

1. **Compute the SVD**: Perform Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on $\mathbf{X}$:
   $$
   \mathbf{X} = \mathbf{U} \boldsymbol{\Sigma} \mathbf{V}^*,
   $$
   where $\mathbf{U} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times r}$, $\boldsymbol{\Sigma} \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times r}$, and $\mathbf{V} \in \mathbb{R}^{m-1 \times r}$, with $r$ being the rank of $\mathbf{X}$.

2. **Project onto the SVD Modes**: Define the matrix $\mathbf{A}_r$ as the projection of $\mathbf{A}$ onto the subspace spanned by the first $r$ singular vectors:
   $$
   \mathbf{A}_r = \mathbf{U}^* \mathbf{A} \mathbf{U} = \mathbf{U}^* \mathbf{X}' \mathbf{V} \boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{-1}.
   $$

3. **Compute the Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**: Solve the eigenvalue problem for $\mathbf{A}_r$:
   $$
   \mathbf{A}_r \mathbf{W} = \mathbf{W} \boldsymbol{\Lambda},
   $$
   where $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}$ contains the eigenvalues and $\mathbf{W}$ the eigenvectors of $\mathbf{A}_r$.

4. **Compute the DMD Modes**: The DMD modes are given by:
   $$
   \boldsymbol{\Phi} = \mathbf{X}' \mathbf{V} \boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{-1} \mathbf{W}.
   $$

5. **Reconstruct the System Dynamics**: The system's evolution can be expressed in terms of the DMD modes and eigenvalues:
   $$
   \mathbf{x}_k \approx \sum_{j=1}^r b_j \boldsymbol{\phi}_j \lambda_j^k,
   $$
   where $b_j$ are coefficients determined from the initial condition $\mathbf{x}_0$.

### Applications

1. **Fluid Dynamics**: DMD is widely used to analyze and model fluid flows, identifying coherent structures and their temporal evolution.
2. **Control Systems**: DMD helps in designing controllers for complex systems by providing a reduced-order model that captures the essential dynamics.
3. **Forecasting**: In various domains like finance and climate science, DMD is used for predicting future states of the system based on past data.
4. **System Identification**: DMD facilitates the identification of dynamical models from experimental data, crucial in engineering and biological systems.

### Example: DMD on a Simple Oscillatory System

Consider a system where the state vector $\mathbf{x}(t)$ evolves as:
$$
\mathbf{x}(t) = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\omega t) \\ \sin(\omega t) \end{bmatrix}.
$$

Suppose we collect snapshots $\mathbf{x}_k = \mathbf{x}(t_k)$ at uniform time intervals $t_k = k \Delta t$. The data matrices $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{X}'$ are:
$$
\mathbf{X} = \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{x}_0 & \mathbf{x}_1 & \cdots & \mathbf{x}_{m-2} \end{bmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{X}' = \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{x}_1 & \mathbf{x}_2 & \cdots & \mathbf{x}_{m-1} \end{bmatrix}.
$$

Following the DMD steps, we approximate the linear operator $\mathbf{A}$ and find the eigenvalues $\lambda_j$ (which will be complex numbers representing the oscillatory nature of the system) and the DMD modes $\boldsymbol{\phi}_j$. The reconstructed dynamics provide a clear view of the underlying oscillatory behavior.

### Conclusion

Dynamic Mode Decomposition bridges the gap between data-driven analysis and the spectral theory of dynamical systems, offering a versatile framework for studying complex systems. By approximating the Koopman operator, DMD extracts essential features of the system's dynamics, making it an invaluable tool in both theoretical and applied contexts.
