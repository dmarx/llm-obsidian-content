### Mathematical Platonism

**Mathematical Platonism** is the view that mathematical entities exist independently of human thought and language. These entities, such as numbers, sets, and geometric forms, are considered abstract, non-physical objects that exist in a realm separate from the physical world. Mathematical Platonism asserts that mathematical truths are discovered rather than invented, and these truths hold universally and necessarily.

#### Key Concepts in Mathematical Platonism

1. **Existence of Abstract Entities:**
   - **Independent Reality:** Mathematical Platonists believe that mathematical entities exist independently of our minds, language, and the physical world. These entities are not mere mental constructs or linguistic conventions.
   - **Non-Spatial and Non-Temporal:** Mathematical objects do not exist in space or time. They are abstract entities that are not affected by physical or temporal changes.

2. **Objective Truth:**
   - **Universality and Necessity:** Mathematical truths are objective, universal, and necessary. For example, the statement "2 + 2 = 4" is true regardless of human beliefs or the physical universe.
   - **Discovery vs. Invention:** Mathematical Platonists argue that mathematical truths are discovered rather than invented. Mathematicians uncover pre-existing truths about abstract entities.

3. **Epistemology:**
   - **Knowledge of Abstract Entities:** Mathematical Platonism raises questions about how we can have knowledge of abstract entities that exist independently of us. Platonists often suggest that we have a form of intellectual intuition or rational insight that allows us to access these truths.
   - **Intellectual Intuition:** This concept posits that humans have a cognitive faculty that enables them to grasp the properties and relationships of abstract mathematical entities.

#### Historical Background

1. **Plato:**
   - **Theory of Forms:** Plato's theory of Forms or Ideas posits that abstract entities exist in a non-physical realm of perfect, immutable Forms. Mathematical objects are among these Forms, representing perfect examples of mathematical concepts.
   - **Allegory of the Cave:** In the allegory, Plato illustrates the difference between the physical world (the cave) and the world of Forms (the sunlight outside the cave). Mathematical entities belong to the latter.

2. **Gottlob Frege:**
   - **Logicism:** Frege supported a form of mathematical Platonism through his logicist program, which sought to reduce mathematics to logic. He argued that numbers and other mathematical entities are objective and exist independently of human thought.

3. **Kurt Gödel:**
   - **Incompleteness Theorems:** Gödel's work in mathematical logic supports Platonism by demonstrating that there are mathematical truths that cannot be proven within a given formal system. He argued that these truths exist independently of our formal systems.
   - **Platonist Views:** Gödel explicitly endorsed mathematical Platonism, suggesting that mathematical entities and truths exist in an abstract realm accessible through rational intuition.

#### Arguments for Mathematical Platonism

1. **Applicability of Mathematics:**
   - **Unreasonable Effectiveness:** The success of mathematics in describing and predicting phenomena in the physical world suggests that mathematical entities have a real existence. Eugene Wigner famously called this the "unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics."

2. **Mathematical Objectivity:**
   - **Consistency Across Cultures:** The consistency and universality of mathematical truths across different cultures and times imply that these truths are not merely human inventions but reflect an objective reality.

3. **Mathematical Discovery:**
   - **Discovery of New Entities:** The history of mathematics includes numerous examples of mathematicians discovering new mathematical entities and relationships, suggesting that these entities exist independently and are discovered rather than created.

4. **Incompleteness and Independence:**
   - **Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems:** Gödel’s theorems show that there are true mathematical statements that cannot be proven within a formal system. This implies that mathematical truths exist independently of our formal theories.

#### Criticisms of Mathematical Platonism

1. **Epistemological Problems:**
   - **Access to Abstract Entities:** Critics question how humans can have knowledge of abstract entities that exist outside space and time. The notion of intellectual intuition is seen as mysterious and lacking a clear explanation.
   - **Benacerraf’s Dilemma:** Paul Benacerraf raised a dilemma questioning how we can have both a satisfactory semantics for mathematical statements and a plausible epistemology for how we know mathematical truths. If mathematical objects are non-physical and non-causal, it’s unclear how we can have knowledge of them.

2. **Ontological Commitments:**
   - **Ontological Parsimony:** Critics argue that mathematical Platonism violates the principle of ontological parsimony (Occam’s Razor) by positing the existence of an infinite number of abstract entities. Nominalists and other anti-Platonists prefer more parsimonious accounts that do not require such commitments.

3. **Alternative Views:**
   - **Nominalism:** Nominalists argue that mathematical entities do not exist independently but are merely useful fictions or linguistic conventions. They contend that mathematics can be understood without committing to the existence of abstract objects.
   - **Formalism and Constructivism:** These alternative views hold that mathematics is a creation of the human mind, focusing on formal systems and constructive processes rather than the existence of abstract entities.

#### Conclusion

Mathematical Platonism posits that mathematical entities exist independently of human thought and language, and that mathematical truths are discovered rather than invented. This view has been supported by notable philosophers and mathematicians such as Plato, Frege, and Gödel, and is grounded in the objectivity, universality, and applicability of mathematics. However, mathematical Platonism faces significant criticisms, particularly concerning the epistemological challenge of how we can have knowledge of abstract entities and the ontological concern of positing an infinite realm of abstract objects. Despite these challenges, mathematical Platonism remains a compelling and influential position in the [[philosophy of mathematics]], offering a robust account of the nature and existence of mathematical entities and truths.
