### Recursive Design Procedures in Nonlinear Control

Recursive design procedures are systematic methods used in the control of nonlinear systems. These procedures break down complex control problems into simpler, smaller sub-problems that can be solved sequentially. Two common recursive design procedures in nonlinear control are **backstepping** and **[[dynamic surface control]] (DSC)**.

### 1. Backstepping

Backstepping is a recursive design methodology used to construct Lyapunov functions and controllers for stabilizing nonlinear systems. This technique is particularly useful for systems that can be transformed into a [[strict-feedback form]].

#### Steps in Backstepping

1. **Step 1: Define the First Lyapunov Function**:
   Start with the first state and define a Lyapunov function \( V_1 \).

2. **Step 2: Introduce a Virtual Control**:
   Treat the second state as a virtual control input for the first subsystem. Define a virtual control law \( \alpha_1 \) to stabilize the first subsystem.

3. **Step 3: Extend the Lyapunov Function**:
   Define an extended Lyapunov function \( V_2 \) that includes the tracking error of the virtual control.

4. **Step 4: Design the Actual Control Input**:
   Use the actual control input \( u \) to stabilize the entire system by ensuring the time derivative of the extended Lyapunov function is negative definite.

#### Example: Backstepping for a Two-State System

Consider a system with states \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \):
$$
\dot{x}_1 = f_1(x_1) + x_2,
$$
$$
\dot{x}_2 = f_2(x_1, x_2) + u.
$$

**Step 1: First Lyapunov Function**:
Define the first Lyapunov function for \( x_1 \):
$$
V_1(x_1) = \frac{1}{2} x_1^2.
$$

**Step 2: Virtual Control**:
Introduce a virtual control \( \alpha_1(x_1) \) to stabilize \( x_1 \). A simple choice could be:
$$
\alpha_1(x_1) = -k_1 x_1,
$$
where \( k_1 \) is a positive constant.

Define the tracking error for the virtual control:
$$
z_1 = x_2 - \alpha_1(x_1) = x_2 + k_1 x_1.
$$

**Step 3: Extended Lyapunov Function**:
Extend the Lyapunov function to include the error \( z_1 \):
$$
V_2(x_1, z_1) = V_1(x_1) + \frac{1}{2} z_1^2 = \frac{1}{2} x_1^2 + \frac{1}{2} (x_2 + k_1 x_1)^2.
$$

**Step 4: Actual Control Input**:
Take the derivative of \( V_2 \) along the trajectories:
$$
\dot{V}_2 = x_1 \dot{x}_1 + z_1 \dot{z}_1.
$$

Using the system dynamics:
$$
\dot{z}_1 = \dot{x}_2 + k_1 \dot{x}_1 = f_2(x_1, x_2) + u + k_1 (f_1(x_1) + x_2).
$$

Substitute and simplify:
$$
\dot{V}_2 = x_1 (f_1(x_1) + x_2) + z_1 (f_2(x_1, x_2) + u + k_1 (f_1(x_1) + x_2)).
$$

Choose the control law \( u \) to make \( \dot{V}_2 \) negative definite. One possible choice is:
$$
u = -f_2(x_1, x_2) - k_1 (f_1(x_1) + x_2) - k_2 z_1,
$$
where \( k_2 \) is a positive constant. This ensures:
$$
\dot{V}_2 = -k_2 z_1^2,
$$
which is negative definite, indicating stability.

### 2. Dynamic Surface Control (DSC)

Dynamic Surface Control (DSC) is an extension of backstepping that addresses the problem of "explosion of complexity" by introducing low-pass filters to keep the derivatives of virtual control signals manageable.

#### Steps in DSC

1. **Filter Design**:
   Design low-pass filters for each virtual control input to avoid taking derivatives of the virtual control signals repeatedly.

2. **Recursive Design**:
   Use the filtered signals to design the control inputs recursively.

#### Example: DSC for a Two-State System

Consider the same two-state system as before:
$$
\dot{x}_1 = f_1(x_1) + x_2,
$$
$$
\dot{x}_2 = f_2(x_1, x_2) + u.
$$

**Step 1: Filter Design**:
Introduce a first-order low-pass filter for the virtual control \( \alpha_1 \):
$$
\tau \dot{\alpha}_1 = -\alpha_1 + \alpha_{1d},
$$
where \( \tau \) is the filter time constant, and \( \alpha_{1d} = -k_1 x_1 \) is the desired virtual control.

**Step 2: Recursive Design**:
Define the error for the virtual control:
$$
z_1 = x_2 - \alpha_1.
$$

**Step 3: Extended Lyapunov Function**:
Define the extended Lyapunov function:
$$
V_2(x_1, z_1) = \frac{1}{2} x_1^2 + \frac{1}{2} z_1^2.
$$

**Step 4: Control Input**:
Calculate the derivative:
$$
\dot{V}_2 = x_1 \dot{x}_1 + z_1 \dot{z}_1.
$$

Substitute the system dynamics and filter dynamics:
$$
\dot{z}_1 = \dot{x}_2 - \dot{\alpha}_1 = f_2(x_1, x_2) + u - \dot{\alpha}_1.
$$

Choose the control input \( u \):
$$
u = -f_2(x_1, x_2) - k_2 z_1 + \dot{\alpha}_1,
$$
which simplifies to:
$$
\dot{V}_2 = x_1 (f_1(x_1) + x_2) + z_1 (f_2(x_1, x_2) - f_2(x_1, x_2) - k_2 z_1 + \dot{\alpha}_1) = -k_2 z_1^2,
$$
indicating stability.

### Conclusion

Recursive design procedures like backstepping and [[dynamic surface control]] provide systematic frameworks for designing controllers for complex nonlinear systems. By breaking down the control problem into manageable sub-problems and addressing the issue of complexity, these methods offer practical solutions for stabilizing and controlling nonlinear dynamic systems.
