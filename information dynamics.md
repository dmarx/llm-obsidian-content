# Information Dynamics

[[Information dynamics]] studies the flow, transformation, and processing of [[information]] in dynamical systems. This framework unifies concepts from [[information theory]], [[statistical mechanics]], and [[dynamical systems theory]].

## Mathematical Framework

### [[Information Flow]] Measures

The [[transfer entropy]] from process Y to process X:

T_Y→X = ∑p(xₙ₊₁,xₙ,yₙ)log[p(xₙ₊₁|xₙ,yₙ)/p(xₙ₊₁|xₙ)]

where:
- p(·) denotes probability distributions
- xₙ, yₙ are system states at time n

### [[Active Information Storage]]

A_X = ∑p(xₙ₊₁,xₙ)log[p(xₙ₊₁|xₙ)/p(xₙ₊₁)]

representing the information from a system's past used to predict its next state.

## Key Concepts

### [[Information Processing]] Operations
- [[Information Transfer]]
- [[Information Storage]]
- [[Information Modification]]
- [[Information Generation]]

### [[Local Information Dynamics]]
For each spatiotemporal point (i,n):
- [[Local Transfer Entropy]]: t_Y→X(i,n)
- [[Local Active Information]]: a_X(i,n)
- [[Local Predictive Information]]: b_X(i,n)

## [[Computational Mechanics]] Connection

### [[ε-Machines]]
- [[Causal States]]: S = ε(x⁻)
- [[Statistical Complexity]]: C_μ = H[S]
- [[Predictive Information]]: E = I[X⁺;X⁻]

where:
- x⁻ denotes the past
- X⁺ denotes the future
- H[·] is [[Shannon entropy]]
- I[·;·] is [[mutual information]]

## Applications

### [[Complex Systems Analysis]]
- [[Emergent Behavior]] detection
- [[Self-Organization]] quantification
- [[Criticality]] identification

### [[Network Science]]
- [[Information Cascades]]
- [[Influence Propagation]]
- [[Network Synchronization]]

### [[Biological Systems]]
- [[Neural Information Processing]]
- [[Genetic Regulatory Networks]]
- [[Cellular Signaling]]

## Advanced Concepts

### [[Information Decomposition]]
- [[Unique Information]]
- [[Redundant Information]]
- [[Synergistic Information]]

The total information can be decomposed:

I_total = I_unique + I_redundant + I_synergistic

### [[Integrated Information Theory]]
- [[Information Integration]]
- [[Causal Emergence]]
- [[Effective Information]]

This framework provides powerful tools for analyzing [[complex systems]], [[emergence]], and [[self-organization]] through the lens of information processing.
