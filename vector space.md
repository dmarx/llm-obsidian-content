### Vector Space

A **vector space** (or linear space) is a fundamental concept in linear algebra and abstract algebra. It consists of a set of vectors, which can be added together and multiplied by scalars (elements from a field), while satisfying specific axioms.

#### Formal Definition

A vector space $V$ over a field $F$ is a set equipped with two operations: vector addition and scalar multiplication. These operations must satisfy the following axioms:

1. **Closure**:
   - For addition: For all $\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v} \in V$, the sum $\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} \in V$.
   - For scalar multiplication: For all $a \in F$ and $\mathbf{v} \in V$, the product $a\mathbf{v} \in V$.

2. **Associativity**:
   - For addition: $(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) + \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{u} + (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w})$ for all $\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w} \in V$.
   - For scalar multiplication: $a(b\mathbf{v}) = (ab)\mathbf{v}$ for all $a, b \in F$ and $\mathbf{v} \in V$.

3. **Commutativity**:
   - For addition: $\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u}$ for all $\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v} \in V$.

4. **Distributivity**:
   - Scalar over vector addition: $a(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) = a\mathbf{u} + a\mathbf{v}$ for all $a \in F$ and $\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v} \in V$.
   - Vector over scalar addition: $(a + b)\mathbf{v} = a\mathbf{v} + b\mathbf{v}$ for all $a, b \in F$ and $\mathbf{v} \in V$.

5. **Identity Elements**:
   - Additive identity: There exists a zero vector $\mathbf{0} \in V$ such that $\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{0} = \mathbf{v}$ for all $\mathbf{v} \in V$.
   - Multiplicative identity: For all $\mathbf{v} \in V$, $1\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{v}$, where $1$ is the multiplicative identity in $F$.

6. **Inverses**:
   - Additive inverse: For each $\mathbf{v} \in V$, there exists a vector $-\mathbf{v} \in V$ such that $\mathbf{v} + (-\mathbf{v}) = \mathbf{0}$.

#### Examples

1. **Real Vector Space**: The set of all $n$-tuples of real numbers $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a vector space over the field of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$. Here, vector addition and scalar multiplication are defined component-wise.

2. **Polynomial Vector Space**: The set of all polynomials with coefficients in a field $F$ forms a vector space over $F$. The operations of polynomial addition and scalar multiplication are performed as usual polynomial operations.

3. **Function Space**: The set of all continuous functions from a topological space $X$ to a field $F$ forms a vector space over $F$. Addition and scalar multiplication are defined pointwise.

#### Basis and Dimension

A **basis** of a vector space $V$ is a set of vectors $\{\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{v}_n\}$ in $V$ that is linearly independent and spans $V$. This means every vector in $V$ can be uniquely expressed as a linear combination of the basis vectors.

The **dimension** of a vector space $V$, denoted $\dim(V)$, is the number of vectors in a basis for $V$. If $V$ has a finite basis, it is called a finite-dimensional vector space; otherwise, it is infinite-dimensional.

#### Linear Transformations

A **linear transformation** (or linear map) between two vector spaces $V$ and $W$ over the same field $F$ is a function $T: V \to W$ that satisfies:
- Additivity: $T(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) = T(\mathbf{u}) + T(\mathbf{v})$ for all $\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v} \in V$.
- Homogeneity: $T(a\mathbf{v}) = aT(\mathbf{v})$ for all $a \in F$ and $\mathbf{v} \in V$.

#### Subspaces

A **subspace** of a vector space $V$ is a subset $W \subseteq V$ that is itself a vector space under the operations of $V$. For $W$ to be a subspace, it must be closed under vector addition and scalar multiplication and contain the zero vector.

### Applications

- **Linear Algebra**: Vector spaces provide the setting for studying matrices, determinants, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors.
- **Differential Equations**: Solutions to linear differential equations form vector spaces.
- **Quantum Mechanics**: State spaces of quantum systems are modeled by complex vector spaces, specifically Hilbert spaces.
- **Computer Graphics**: Transformations and operations on graphical objects are performed using vector spaces and linear algebra.
