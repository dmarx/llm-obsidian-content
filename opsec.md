Operational security (OpSec) is a [[risk management process]] that helps in identifying critical information to determine if friendly actions can be observed by adversary intelligence systems, determines if information obtained by adversaries could be interpreted to be useful to them, and then executes selected measures that eliminate or reduce adversary exploitation of friendly critical information.

### Core Principles of OpSec

OpSec is typically structured around five key steps, often referred to as the OpSec process. These steps are designed to prevent sensitive information from falling into the wrong hands:

1. **Identification of Critical Information**: Determining what information, if known by adversaries, could substantially compromise or damage the organization's ability to operate effectively.

2. **Analysis of Threats**: Assessing the potential adversaries who might be interested in obtaining the critical information and their capability to obtain it.

3. **Analysis of Vulnerabilities**: Examining how organizational operations or other actions could inadvertently reveal critical information to potential adversaries.

4. **Assessment of Risks**: Considering the vulnerabilities against the capabilities and intentions of potential threats to determine the risk (likelihood and impact) of critical information being compromised.

5. **Application of Appropriate Countermeasures**: Implementing methods to mitigate the risks identified, such as through policies, procedures, technical solutions, and training.

### Mathematical Formalisms in OpSec

In the realm of applied mathematics and statistics, OpSec can involve various quantitative approaches such as:

- **Probability Theory**: The likelihood of information leakage can be modeled using probability distributions. For example, if $P(E)$ denotes the probability of an event where sensitive data is exposed, risk assessments can be mathematically represented and calculated to guide OpSec measures.

- **Game Theory**: This can be applied to model the interaction between an organization (defender) and potential adversaries (attackers). Here, strategies of both the defender and the attacker are analyzed to predict outcomes and optimize defense mechanisms.

- **Cryptographic Measures**: Encryption techniques can be used as part of OpSec to protect data. The security of these cryptographic measures often relies on mathematical hardness assumptions, like the difficulty of factoring large prime numbers.

### Relation to Other Security Disciplines

OpSec is often considered in conjunction with other security practices such as:

- [[Information Security|InfoSec]]: While InfoSec focuses broadly on the protection of information assets through the use of technology, policies, and controls, OpSec specifically addresses the control of information to prevent it from being exploited by adversaries.

- [[Physical Security]]: This involves measures designed to deny unauthorized access to facilities, equipment, and resources, and to protect personnel and property from damage or harm.

- [[Cybersecurity]]: This focuses on protecting computer systems from theft or damage to their hardware, software, or electronic data, as well as from disruption or misdirection of the services they provide.

Understanding and implementing effective OpSec is crucial in a variety of fields, from military operations to corporate settings, where protecting sensitive information is paramount to maintaining competitive advantage and operational integrity.
