# Satisficing Model

Satisficing is a [[decision-making strategy]] introduced by [[Herbert Simon]] that abandons the pursuit of the optimal solution in favor of finding a solution that meets a predefined threshold of acceptability. This approach fundamentally challenges the [[classical economic rationality]] assumption that decision-makers always maximize utility, instead acknowledging the [[bounded rationality]] inherent in real-world decision processes.

## Mathematical Formalization

### Basic Satisficing

In its simplest form, the satisficing model can be formalized as:

$$\text{Select } a \in A \text{ such that } U(a, s) \geq \theta$$

Where:
- $A$ is the set of all possible actions
- $U(a, s)$ is the utility of action $a$ in state $s$
- $\theta$ is an acceptability threshold (aspiration level)

Unlike optimization, which requires evaluating the entire action space to find $\arg\max_{a \in A} U(a, s)$, satisficing terminates upon finding the first action that meets the threshold.

### Sequential Satisficing

In sequential decision contexts, satisficing can be modeled as a search through a potentially infinite action space:

$$a_t = \text{first } a \in \{a_1, a_2, ...\} \text{ such that } U(a, s) \geq \theta_t$$

Where actions are evaluated in sequence and $\theta_t$ may be adjusted over time based on experience.

### Aspiration Level Dynamics

The threshold $\theta$ often adapts based on experience, formalized as:

$$\theta_{t+1} = f(\theta_t, U(a_t, s_t), \text{env}_t)$$

Where:
- $\theta_t$ is the aspiration level at time $t$
- $U(a_t, s_t)$ is the utility of the chosen action
- $\text{env}_t$ represents environmental factors
- $f$ is an update function that typically increases $\theta$ after success and decreases it after failure

## Computational Implementation

Satisficing can be implemented through several computational mechanisms:

### 1. Threshold-Based Termination

$$\begin{align}
&\text{for } a \in A \text{ do}\\
&\quad\text{if } U(a, s) \geq \theta \text{ then}\\
&\quad\quad\text{return } a\\
&\quad\text{end if}\\
&\text{end for}
\end{align}$$

### 2. Anytime Decision Algorithms

$$\begin{align}
&a_{\text{best}} \leftarrow \text{null}, u_{\text{best}} \leftarrow -\infty\\
&\text{while computational\_budget\_remains() do}\\
&\quad a \leftarrow \text{sample\_action()}\\
&\quad u \leftarrow \text{estimate\_utility}(a, s)\\
&\quad\text{if } u > u_{\text{best}} \text{ then}\\
&\quad\quad a_{\text{best}} \leftarrow a, u_{\text{best}} \leftarrow u\\
&\quad\text{end if}\\
&\quad\text{if } u_{\text{best}} \geq \theta \text{ then break}\\
&\text{end while}\\
&\text{return } a_{\text{best}}
\end{align}$$

## Theoretical Properties

Satisficing exhibits several important theoretical properties:

### 1. Computational Efficiency

The expected computational cost of satisficing scales with:

$$E[C] = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} i \cdot p(i) \cdot \prod_{j=1}^{i-1} (1-p(j))$$

Where $p(i)$ is the probability that the $i$-th evaluated action meets the threshold.

### 2. Optimality Under Constraints

Under specific conditions, satisficing approximates constrained optimization:

$$\max_{a \in A} U(a, s) \text{ subject to } C(a) \leq C_{\max}$$

Where $C(a)$ represents the cost of evaluating action $a$ and $C_{\max}$ is a cost constraint.

### 3. Regret Bounds

The expected regret of satisficing compared to optimization is bounded by:

$$E[U(a^*, s) - U(a_{\text{sat}}, s)] \leq U(a^*, s) - \theta$$

Where $a^*$ is the optimal action and $a_{\text{sat}}$ is the satisficing action.

## Applications in AI and Machine Learning

Satisficing principles appear in several AI approaches:

### 1. [[Early Stopping Criteria]]

In iterative optimization, algorithms terminate when improvements fall below a threshold:

$$\text{Stop when } |f(x_{t+1}) - f(x_t)| < \epsilon$$

### 2. [[Beam Search]]

Keeping only the top-$k$ candidates at each step rather than exploring the entire search space:

$$B_{t+1} = \text{top-}k(\{(a, s') | a \in A, s' = T(s, a), (Â·, s) \in B_t\})$$

Where $B_t$ is the beam at time $t$ and $T$ is the transition function.

### 3. [[Reinforcement Learning with Satisficing Objectives]]

Adapting RL to seek satisfactory rather than optimal policies:

$$\pi^*_{\text{sat}} = \arg\min_{\pi} \{\mathbb{E}_{\pi}[C(s, a)] : \mathbb{E}_{\pi}[R(s, a)] \geq \theta\}$$

Where $C(s, a)$ is a cost function and $R(s, a)$ is a reward function.

## Cognitive Foundations

Satisficing aligns with several observed patterns in human cognition:

### 1. [[Recognition-Primed Decision Making]]

Experts often select the first recognizably good option rather than comparing all alternatives.

### 2. [[Take-the-First Heuristic]]

In time-constrained situations, the first generated option is frequently selected.

### 3. [[Lexicographic Decision Rules]]

Evaluating options based on the most important attribute first, only considering additional attributes if necessary:

$$\begin{align}
&\text{for } i \in \{1, 2, ..., n\} \text{ do}\\
&\quad a_{\text{best}} \leftarrow \arg\max_{a \in A} \text{attr}_i(a)\\
&\quad A' \leftarrow \{a \in A : \text{attr}_i(a) = \text{attr}_i(a_{\text{best}})\}\\
&\quad\text{if } |A'| = 1 \text{ then return } a_{\text{best}}\\
&\quad A \leftarrow A'\\
&\text{end for}
\end{align}$$

## Connections to Other Decision Models

Satisficing relates to several complementary decision frameworks:

### 1. [[Fast and Frugal Heuristics]]

Satisficing often serves as a component in ecological rationality models like the [[Take-The-Best heuristic]].

### 2. [[Multi-Armed Bandit Problems]]

The [[Epsilon-First strategy]] implements a form of satisficing by exploring initially, then exploiting the first option exceeding a threshold.

### 3. [[Prospect Theory]]

Both approaches acknowledge that decision-makers use reference points, with satisficing explicitly using $\theta$ as a reference.

## Extensions and Generalizations

### 1. [[Multi-Criteria Satisficing]]

When multiple objectives must be satisfied simultaneously:

$$\text{Select } a \in A \text{ such that } \forall i \in \{1, 2, ..., m\} : U_i(a, s) \geq \theta_i$$

Where $U_i$ represents utility along dimension $i$.

### 2. [[Probabilistic Satisficing]]

Incorporating uncertainty in utility estimation:

$$\text{Select } a \in A \text{ such that } P(U(a, s) \geq \theta) \geq p_{\min}$$

Where $p_{\min}$ is a minimum confidence threshold.

### 3. [[Risk-Aware Satisficing]]

Incorporating risk preferences:

$$\text{Select } a \in A \text{ such that } \mathbb{E}[U(a, s)] - \lambda \cdot \text{Var}[U(a, s)] \geq \theta$$

Where $\lambda$ represents risk aversion.

## Philosophical Implications

The satisficing model has profound philosophical implications:

1. **[[Procedural Rationality]]**: Defines rationality in terms of the decision procedure rather than outcome optimality
2. **[[Ecological Rationality]]**: Recognizes that decision mechanisms are adapted to specific environments
3. **[[Good-Enough Principle]]**: Challenges perfectionism in favor of sufficiency

Satisficing remains a fundamental concept bridging descriptive models of human decision-making and prescriptive models for artificial intelligence systems operating under realistic constraints.
