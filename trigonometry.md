# Trigonometry

Trigonometry is a branch of mathematics that studies relationships involving lengths and angles of triangles. The field evolved from applications measuring the distances and angles in the celestial sphere and in navigation.

## Core Concepts

### Angles

An angle is formed by two rays originating from the same endpoint. In trigonometry, angles are typically measured in degrees or radians. One complete revolution is $360^\circ$ or $2\pi$ radians.

### Trigonometric Functions

The six fundamental trigonometric functions are sine, cosine, tangent, cosecant, secant, and cotangent. These functions are defined based on the relationships between the angles and sides of a right triangle, and they can be extended to functions of any real number using the unit circle.

1. **Sine ($\sin$)**: For an angle $\theta$, $\sin(\theta)$ is the ratio of the length of the side opposite $\theta$ to the length of the hypotenuse.
   $$ \sin(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} $$

2. **Cosine ($\cos$)**: For an angle $\theta$, $\cos(\theta)$ is the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the length of the hypotenuse.
   $$ \cos(\theta) = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}} $$

3. **Tangent ($\tan$)**: For an angle $\theta$, $\tan(\theta)$ is the ratio of the sine of the angle to the cosine of the angle, or the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side.
   $$ \tan(\theta) = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} $$

4. **Cosecant ($\csc$)**: The reciprocal of sine.
   $$ \csc(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sin(\theta)} $$

5. **Secant ($\sec$)**: The reciprocal of cosine.
   $$ \sec(\theta) = \frac{1}{\cos(\theta)} $$

6. **Cotangent ($\cot$)**: The reciprocal of tangent.
   $$ \cot(\theta) = \frac{1}{\tan(\theta)} = \frac{\cos(\theta)}{\sin(\theta)} $$

### The Unit Circle

The unit circle is a circle centered at the origin (0,0) in the coordinate plane, with a radius of 1. Every point on the unit circle can be described by coordinates $(\cos(\theta), \sin(\theta))$, where $\theta$ is the angle formed by the line connecting the point and the origin with the positive x-axis.

### Pythagorean Identity

The basic identity in trigonometry, which relates the squares of the sine and cosine of an angle, is:
$$ \sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = 1 $$

### Trigonometric Identities

Trigonometric identities are equations involving trigonometric functions that are true for every value of the occurring variables. Key identities include:

- **Sum and Difference Formulas**: These formulas express the sine and cosine of sums and differences of angles in terms of the sines and cosines of the angles themselves.
- **Double Angle Formulas**: These allow the trigonometric functions of double angles to be expressed in terms of the original angle.
- **Half-Angle Formulas**: These provide a way to find the sine, cosine, and tangent of half an angle.

### Applications

Trigonometry is used in various scientific fields, including physics, engineering, astronomy, and geography, as well as in everyday problems like determining heights, distances, and angles. It's foundational in the analysis of waves, oscillations, and circles.

## Advanced Topics

Advanced trigonometry includes the study of trigonometric series, Fourier series, and their applications in solving differential equations, signal processing, and image analysis. Trigonometric functions can also be generalized to complex numbers.
