Non-Fermi Liquid


**ASSISTANT**

Non-Fermi liquid (NFL) behavior refers to a class of phenomena observed in certain strongly correlated materials where the electronic properties deviate significantly from those predicted by the traditional Fermi liquid theory. Fermi liquid theory, developed by Lev Landau, describes the low-temperature properties of most metals and predicts well-defined quasiparticles with a one-to-one correspondence to the states of non-interacting electrons. Non-Fermi liquids, however, do not adhere to this description, displaying unusual temperature dependencies and anomalous transport properties.

## Overview

### Fermi Liquid Theory

In Fermi liquid theory, the low-energy excitations in a metal are quasiparticles with the same quantum numbers as non-interacting electrons but with renormalized parameters, such as effective mass and lifetime. Key properties include:
- **Linear Specific Heat**: The specific heat \( C \) is proportional to the temperature \( T \), i.e., \( C \propto T \).
- **Quadratic Resistivity**: The electrical resistivity \( \rho \) varies as \( \rho \propto T^2 \).
- **Constant Magnetic Susceptibility**: The magnetic susceptibility \( \chi \) is temperature-independent.

### Non-Fermi Liquid Behavior

Non-Fermi liquids exhibit deviations from these standard behaviors. Common characteristics of NFL behavior include:
- **Unusual Specific Heat**: The specific heat may have a different temperature dependence, such as \( C \propto T \ln T \).
- **Linear Resistivity**: Instead of the \( T^2 \) dependence, the resistivity often shows a linear temperature dependence, \( \rho \propto T \).
- **Divergent or Non-constant Magnetic Susceptibility**: The magnetic susceptibility may show a divergent behavior or a non-trivial temperature dependence.

### Physical Origins of Non-Fermi Liquid Behavior

Several mechanisms can lead to NFL behavior, including:
- **Quantum Criticality**: Proximity to a quantum critical point (QCP) where a continuous phase transition occurs at zero temperature.
- **Strong Electron Correlations**: Enhanced interactions between electrons, particularly in low-dimensional systems or near Mott transitions.
- **Disorder and Localization**: Random impurities and disorder can lead to non-Fermi liquid behavior in certain cases.

### Examples of Non-Fermi Liquid Systems

1. **Heavy Fermion Systems**: These systems, such as CeCu$_6$ and YbRh$_2$Si$_2$, often exhibit NFL behavior near a quantum critical point where the competition between Kondo screening and magnetic ordering leads to critical fluctuations.
2. **High-Temperature Superconductors**: The normal state of high-$T_c$ cuprates and iron-based superconductors often shows NFL characteristics, such as linear resistivity.
3. **Quantum Dots**: Systems like quantum dots in the Kondo regime can exhibit NFL behavior due to the interplay between local moment formation and conduction electron screening.

### Theoretical Models

Several theoretical frameworks have been developed to describe NFL behavior:

1. **Hertz-Millis-Moriya Theory**: This theory extends the concepts of classical phase transitions to quantum phase transitions, where critical fluctuations dominate the low-temperature behavior.
2. **Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT)**: DMFT can capture NFL behavior in strongly correlated electron systems by treating local interactions exactly and providing insights into the self-energy and spectral functions.
3. **AdS/CFT Correspondence**: The holographic duality approach from string theory has been applied to model certain types of NFL behavior by relating them to gravitational systems in higher dimensions.

### Mathematical Formalism

The anomalous properties of non-Fermi liquids can often be expressed in terms of the self-energy \(\Sigma(\omega)\) of the electronic Green's function \(G(\omega)\):

$$
G(\omega) = \frac{1}{\omega - \epsilon_k - \Sigma(\omega)}
$$

For Fermi liquids, the self-energy \(\Sigma(\omega)\) has a specific form at low frequencies:

$$
\Sigma(\omega) \approx \omega(1 - Z^{-1}) + i \frac{\omega^2}{2\epsilon_F}
$$

where \( Z \) is the quasiparticle weight. In non-Fermi liquids, this form is altered, leading to different scaling behaviors:

$$
\Sigma(\omega) \propto \omega^{\alpha} - i \omega^{\beta}
$$

with \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) differing from the Fermi liquid values, often leading to linear or other non-quadratic dependencies in physical observables.

## Applications and Implications

Understanding NFL behavior is crucial for several reasons:
- **Material Design**: Insights into NFL behavior can guide the design of new materials with desirable electronic properties, such as high-temperature superconductors.
- **Quantum Computing**: NFL systems may offer unique properties that can be harnessed in quantum computing and information processing.
- **Fundamental Physics**: Studying NFL behavior helps in understanding the breakdown of traditional quasiparticle descriptions and the emergence of new phases of matter.
