### Floor Rules of the House of Representatives

The floor rules of the [[House of Representatives|House]] dictate how legislative business is conducted during sessions. These rules ensure order, fairness, and efficiency in the legislative process. They are codified in the House Rules Manual and are established at the beginning of each Congress. Below are the key aspects of the floor rules in the House:

#### 1. **Order of Business**

The House follows a structured order of business during its sessions. This typically includes:
- **Prayer by the Chaplain**: The session starts with a prayer.
- **Pledge of Allegiance**: Members recite the Pledge of Allegiance.
- **Reading and Approval of the Journal**: The previous session's journal (record of proceedings) is read and approved.
- **One-Minute Speeches**: Members may address the House for one minute on any topic.
- **Morning Hour**: Time set aside for members to introduce bills and resolutions.
- **Legislative Business**: Consideration of bills, resolutions, and other legislative matters.

#### 2. **Recognition**

- **Speaker's Role**: The Speaker of the House has the authority to recognize members who wish to speak. Members must wait for the Speaker to acknowledge them before speaking.
- **Request for Recognition**: Members typically request recognition by rising and addressing the Speaker ("Mr. Speaker" or "Madam Speaker").

#### 3. **Debate**

- **Time Limits**: Debate time is generally limited. The Rules Committee often sets specific time limits for debate on particular bills.
- **Control of Debate**: Debate on a bill is usually controlled by the member who introduces it and the ranking member of the relevant committee. They allocate time to other members.
- **Rules for Speaking**: Members must speak only to the matter under consideration and avoid personal attacks. They must also address their remarks to the Speaker.

#### 4. **Motions**

Motions are formal proposals for action. Key types of motions include:
- **Main Motions**: Propose new business or decisions.
- **Subsidiary Motions**: Modify or dispose of main motions. Examples include:
  - **Amend**: Modify the text of a bill.
  - **Table**: Lay the bill aside.
  - **Previous Question**: End debate and proceed to a vote.
- **Privileged Motions**: Address urgent matters not related to the main business. Examples include:
  - **Adjourn**: End the session.
  - **Recess**: Take a break in the session.
- **Incidental Motions**: Deal with procedural issues. Examples include:
  - **Point of Order**: Question whether the rules are being followed.
  - **Division of the House**: Request a counted vote if the result of a voice vote is unclear.

#### 5. **Voting**

The House uses several methods of voting:
- **Voice Vote**: Members verbally express their votes. The Speaker announces the result based on what they hear.
- **Division Vote**: Members stand to indicate their vote, allowing for a visual count.
- **Recorded Vote**: The most common method, using electronic devices to record individual votes. A minimum of 25 members must request a recorded vote.

#### 6. **Quorum**

- **Quorum Requirement**: A quorum, the minimum number of members required to conduct business, is a majority of the House (218 members).
- **Quorum Calls**: If a member suggests that a quorum is not present, the Speaker may initiate a quorum call to compel attendance.

#### 7. **Special Rules**

- **Rules Committee**: The Rules Committee plays a crucial role in determining the terms of debate for specific bills. It issues special rules that set the conditions for considering a bill, including time limits for debate and which amendments may be offered.
- **Types of Rules**:
  - **Open Rule**: Allows any member to offer amendments.
  - **Closed Rule**: Prohibits amendments.
  - **Structured Rule**: Allows only specific amendments.

#### 8. **Discharge Petitions**

- **Purpose**: A discharge petition allows members to force a bill out of committee and onto the floor for consideration.
- **Requirements**: Requires the signatures of a majority of House members (218).

#### 9. **Points of Order**

- **Raising Points of Order**: Members can raise points of order to question whether the House's rules are being followed.
- **Speakerâ€™s Ruling**: The Speaker rules on points of order, and their decision is generally final unless appealed to the House.

#### 10. **Committee of the Whole**

- **Function**: The House often resolves into the Committee of the Whole to consider and debate bills. This allows for more efficient debate and amendment procedures.
- **Operation**: The Speaker appoints a chair to preside, and the rules are more relaxed than in the full House.

Understanding these procedural rules is essential for navigating the legislative process in the House of Representatives. They ensure that the House operates smoothly, fairly, and efficiently, enabling it to fulfill its legislative functions effectively. For detailed guidelines, refer to the official House Rules Manual and other relevant parliamentary authorities.
