**USER**

Noether's current


**ASSISTANT**

[[Noether's theorem|Noether's theorem]] is a fundamental principle in theoretical physics and mathematics, establishing a profound connection between symmetries and conserved quantities in physical systems. Developed by Emmy Noether in 1915, the theorem has far-reaching implications in both classical and quantum physics. Before delving into the concept of Noether's current, it's essential to understand the context and the theorem itself.

### Noether's Theorem in a Nutshell

Noether's theorem states that for every continuous symmetry of the action of a physical system, there exists an associated conserved quantity. In more formal terms, if a system's Lagrangian (a function describing the system's dynamics) is invariant under a continuous group of transformations (symmetries), then there are corresponding quantities whose values are conserved over time.

- **Continuous symmetry** involves transformations that can be parametrized by a continuous parameter, such as spatial translations, time translations, and rotations.
- **Conserved quantity** is a physical property that remains unchanged as the system evolves, such as energy, momentum, and angular momentum.

### Mathematical Formulation

Given a Lagrangian $L(q_i, \dot{q}_i, t)$, where $q_i$ are the generalized coordinates and $\dot{q}_i$ their time derivatives, Noether's theorem can be formalized as follows. If the action $S = \int L \, dt$ is invariant under a transformation of the coordinates and time, $q_i \to q_i' = q_i + \delta q_i$ and $t \to t' = t + \delta t$, then there exists a conserved quantity $Q$ given by:

$$Q = \sum_i \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i} \delta q_i \right) - (L - \sum_i \dot{q}_i \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i})\delta t$$

### Noether's Current

Expanding from Noether's theorem to field theory, where systems are described in terms of fields (functions of space and time) rather than just particles, the concept of Noether's current emerges. In the context of field theory, the conserved quantity associated with a continuous symmetry is expressed through a current, a function of space and time, whose divergence is zero. This property implies the conservation of the corresponding physical quantity.

The formal expression for Noether's current $J^\mu$ in field theory, derived from a symmetry of the action, is:

$$J^\mu = \frac{\partial L}{\partial (\partial_\mu \phi)} \delta \phi - F^\mu$$

where
- $\mu$ denotes the spacetime indices,
- $\phi$ represents the fields in the theory,
- $\partial_\mu$ signifies the partial derivative with respect to spacetime coordinates,
- $\delta \phi$ is the variation of the field under the symmetry transformation,
- $L$ is the Lagrangian density of the field theory, and
- $F^\mu$ is a function related to the explicit time dependence of the transformation.

The conservation of Noether's current is mathematically represented as:

$$\partial_\mu J^\mu = 0$$

This equation signifies that the total "charge" (the integral of $J^0$, the time component of Noether's current, over all space) associated with the symmetry is conserved over time.

### Conclusion

Noether's theorem and the concept of Noether's current provide a powerful framework for identifying conserved quantities in physical systems, offering deep insights into the symmetry principles governing the laws of nature. This interplay between symmetry and conservation laws is central to much of modern theoretical physics, from classical mechanics to quantum field theory.
