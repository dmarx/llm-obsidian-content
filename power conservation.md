# Power Conservation

[[Power conservation]] represents a fundamental principle in physics, expressing the idea that [[energy per unit time]] remains constant in isolated systems. This concept manifests differently across various domains while maintaining its essential mathematical structure.

## Mathematical Formalization

For a general system, let E represent the total [[energy]] and t represent time. The [[instantaneous power]] P is defined as:

P = dE/dt

For a closed system with n components, the principle of power conservation states:

∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿ Pᵢ = 0

## Domain-Specific Manifestations

### Mechanical Systems
In [[mechanical systems]], power conservation relates [[force]] (F), [[velocity]] (v), [[torque]] (τ), and [[angular velocity]] (ω):

P = F·v = τ·ω

For coupled mechanical elements (denoted by subscripts 1 and 2):

P₁ = -P₂
F₁v₁ = -F₂v₂
τ₁ω₁ = -τ₂ω₂

### Electrical Systems
In [[electrical circuits]], power conservation manifests through [[voltage]] (V) and [[current]] (I):

P = VI

For a circuit with m branches:

∑ⱼ₌₁ᵐ VⱼIⱼ = 0

### Hydraulic Systems
In [[fluid systems]], power conservation relates [[pressure]] (p) and [[volumetric flow rate]] (Q):

P = pQ

For a system with k flow paths:

∑ₖ pₖQₖ = 0

## Complex Systems Analysis

In [[multi-domain systems]], power conservation provides a unifying framework through [[bond graph theory]]. The [[power conjugate variables]] (effort e and flow f) generalize the domain-specific relationships:

P = ef

This formulation enables systematic analysis of [[energy transfer]] across domain boundaries through [[power ports]] and [[junction structures]].

## Practical Implications

Power conservation underlies key engineering principles:
- [[Impedance matching]] for maximum power transfer
- [[Power factor correction]] in electrical systems
- [[Transmission efficiency]] optimization
- [[Energy harvesting]] system design

The principle provides essential constraints for [[system modeling]] and serves as a validation check for [[numerical simulations]].
