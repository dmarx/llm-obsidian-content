# GRIMMER Test

## Overview

The [[GRIMMER test]] ([[G]]ranularity-[[R]]elated [[I]]nconsistency of [[M]]eans and [[M]]edians [[E]]xtended to [[R]]eplication) is an advanced statistical consistency check that builds upon the foundational [[GRIM test]] methodology. While GRIM focuses specifically on the mathematical consistency of reported means with integer data, GRIMMER extends these principles to include medians and applies them to replication scenarios. This comprehensive approach enhances the detection of potential errors, inconsistencies, or data fabrication in scientific research.

## Mathematical Foundations

### Core Principle

The GRIMMER test is based on the mathematical constraints that apply to summary statistics when the underlying data consists of integers or values on a discrete scale (such as Likert scales).

### Formal Definition

For a dataset of size $n$ with integer values, the following constraints apply:

1. **Mean Constraint (GRIM)**:
   If $\bar{x}$ is the reported mean, then $n \times \bar{x}$ must be an integer, and the reported mean must equal the reconstruction:
   $$\bar{x} = \text{round}(\frac{\text{round}(n \times \bar{x})}{n}, d)$$
   where $d$ is the number of decimal places reported.

2. **Median Constraint**:
   For a dataset of size $n$ with integer values:
   - If $n$ is odd, the median must be an integer
   - If $n$ is even, the median must be either an integer or an integer plus 0.5

3. **Replication Constraint**:
   If two studies report means $\bar{x}_1$ and $\bar{x}_2$ with sample sizes $n_1$ and $n_2$, then the combined mean $\bar{x}_c$ must satisfy:
   $$\bar{x}_c = \frac{n_1\bar{x}_1 + n_2\bar{x}_2}{n_1 + n_2}$$
   And this combined mean must also satisfy the GRIM test.

## Implementation Methodology

### Testing Means (GRIM Component)

The procedure for testing means follows the original GRIM methodology:

1. Multiply the reported mean by the sample size: $S = n \times \bar{x}$
2. Round $S$ to the nearest integer: $S_{rounded} = \text{round}(S)$
3. Divide the rounded sum by the sample size: $\bar{x}_{reconstructed} = S_{rounded} / n$
4. Round $\bar{x}_{reconstructed}$ to the same number of decimal places as the reported mean
5. Compare $\bar{x}_{reconstructed}$ with the reported mean $\bar{x}$
6. The test fails if they differ

### Testing Medians

The test for medians verifies that the reported median is consistent with the constraints for integer data:

1. For odd sample sizes ($n = 2k + 1$), the median must be an integer
2. For even sample sizes ($n = 2k$), the median must be either an integer or an integer plus 0.5
3. Additionally, the median must be within the range of possible values for the measurement scale

### Testing Replication Consistency

For studies that replicate or extend previous work, GRIMMER tests whether the reported statistics are consistent across studies:

1. Calculate what the combined mean would be based on the reported means and sample sizes from multiple studies
2. Apply the GRIM test to this combined mean
3. Verify that the reported combined mean (if given) matches the calculated combined mean
4. Check that all individual means and the combined mean pass their respective GRIM tests

## Advanced Applications

### Detecting Fabricated Standard Deviations

GRIMMER can be extended to test the consistency of standard deviations through the relation:

$$s^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}$$

For integer data, this imposes constraints on possible standard deviation values given the mean and sample size.

### Consistency Across Multiple Statistics

GRIMMER checks consistency across different reported statistics for the same dataset:

1. Reported means and standard deviations must be consistent with possible integer datasets
2. Reported medians must be consistent with the constraints for integer data
3. Reported ranges, minimum, and maximum values must be consistent with the mean and median

### Symbolic Notation for Extended Consistency Checks

Let $\mathcal{S}(D)$ represent the set of summary statistics reported for dataset $D$:

$$\mathcal{S}(D) = \{\bar{x}, M_d, s, \text{min}, \text{max}, ...\}$$

Where $\bar{x}$ is the mean, $M_d$ is the median, $s$ is the standard deviation, and min/max are the minimum and maximum values.

The GRIMMER consistency function $\Gamma$ can be defined as:

$$\Gamma(\mathcal{S}(D), n, \mathcal{R}) = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if all statistics are mutually consistent} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

Where $n$ is the sample size and $\mathcal{R}$ is the allowed range of values.

## Practical Implementation

### Algorithmic Approach

```
function GRIMMER_test(statistics, sample_size, decimal_places, value_range):
    # Test mean using GRIM
    grim_result = GRIM_test(statistics.mean, sample_size, decimal_places)
    
    # Test median
    if sample_size % 2 == 1:  # Odd sample size
        median_result = (statistics.median % 1 == 0)  # Must be integer
    else:  # Even sample size
        median_result = (statistics.median % 1 == 0) or (statistics.median % 1 == 0.5)
    
    # Test range consistency
    range_result = (statistics.mean >= value_range[0]) and (statistics.mean <= value_range[1])
    
    # Combined result
    return grim_result and median_result and range_result
```

### Software Implementations

Several implementations of GRIMMER exist:

1. **R package**: `grimmer` provides functions for testing means, medians, and standard deviations
2. **Python library**: `scigrimmer` implements GRIMMER tests with visualization tools
3. **Web applications**: Online tools that allow researchers to upload their statistics for automated checking

## Statistical Power and Sensitivity

### Factors Affecting Detection Power

The power of GRIMMER to detect inconsistencies depends on:

1. **Sample Size**: Smaller sample sizes yield stronger constraints and higher detection rates
2. **Decimal Precision**: Reporting to more decimal places increases detection power
3. **Scale Range**: Narrower scales (e.g., 1-5 Likert) provide stronger constraints than wider scales
4. **Statistic Type**: Some statistics (e.g., means) have stronger constraints than others

### Mathematical Expression of Detection Power

For means, the probability of detecting an inconsistency in fabricated data can be approximated as:

$$P(\text{detection}) \approx 1 - \frac{10^{-d} \times n}{R_{max} - R_{min} + 1}$$

Where $d$ is the decimal precision, $n$ is the sample size, and $R_{max} - R_{min} + 1$ is the number of possible integer values.

For medians in datasets of odd size $n$, the constraint is simply that the median must be an integer, giving a 50% detection rate for randomly fabricated medians reported to one decimal place.

## Applications in Research Integrity

### Primary Uses

GRIMMER has several applications in promoting research integrity:

1. **Pre-publication Screening**: Journals can implement GRIMMER checks as part of their review process
2. **Post-publication Review**: Researchers can apply GRIMMER to evaluate published studies
3. **Meta-analysis Quality Control**: GRIMMER can help identify potentially problematic studies for exclusion
4. **Educational Tool**: Teaching GRIMMER helps researchers understand the mathematical constraints on statistics

### Case Studies

Several high-profile cases have demonstrated GRIMMER's effectiveness:

1. **Psychology Replication Crisis**: GRIMMER has been used to identify papers with inconsistent statistics that could not have come from the reported methodologies
2. **Clinical Trials Analysis**: Applied to detect potential issues in reported outcomes from medical research
3. **Educational Research Evaluation**: Used to assess the quality of quantitative research in education

## Limitations and Considerations

### Potential False Positives

GRIMMER may produce false positives in cases of:

1. **Non-integer Data**: When underlying data contains non-integers but is treated as integers in the analysis
2. **Rounding Conventions**: Different rounding methods (ceiling, floor, or different rounding rules) can lead to apparent inconsistencies
3. **Typographical Errors**: Simple reporting errors might be flagged as inconsistencies
4. **Missing Data Handling**: When means are calculated after excluding missing values but sample sizes are reported incorrectly

### Interpretation Guidelines

When interpreting GRIMMER results, researchers should:

1. Consider alternative explanations before concluding data fabrication
2. Contact original authors for clarification when inconsistencies are found
3. Examine multiple statistics to build evidence for systematic issues
4. Consider the journal's or field's typical reporting standards

## Extensions and Future Directions

### GRIMMER-Replication

A specialized extension of GRIMMER focuses on replication studies, checking whether:

1. The reported statistics from original and replication studies are individually consistent
2. The combined statistics are mathematically possible given the reported individual results
3. The reported effect sizes are consistent across studies given the sample sizes

### Integration with Other Methods

GRIMMER becomes more powerful when combined with other statistical forensics techniques:

1. **[[P-curve analysis]]**: Examining the distribution of p-values for evidence of p-hacking
2. **[[SPRITE method]]**: Reconstructing possible datasets from summary statistics
3. **[[Terminal digit analysis]]**: Looking for non-random patterns in the last digits of reported statistics
4. **[[Benford's law]]**: Checking whether first digits follow expected distributions

### Formalized Unified Framework

A comprehensive statistical forensics framework can be defined as:

$$\Psi(S) = \{G(S), M(S), B(S), P(S), T(S), ...\}$$

Where:
- $G(S)$ is the GRIM test result
- $M(S)$ is the median consistency test result
- $B(S)$ is the Benford's law compliance
- $P(S)$ is the p-curve analysis result
- $T(S)$ is the terminal digit analysis result
