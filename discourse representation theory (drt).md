### Discourse Representation Theory (DRT)

Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) is a framework developed by Hans Kamp in the 1980s for analyzing the semantics of natural language, particularly focusing on how the meanings of sentences combine to form the meaning of a whole discourse. Unlike traditional formal semantics, which often struggles to handle phenomena like anaphora, tense, and presupposition across sentences, DRT introduces a dynamic perspective: it models how information changes and accumulates as discourse progresses.

The core of DRT is the **Discourse Representation Structure (DRS)**, which serves as a formalism for representing the meaning of sentences and the way they interact within a larger context. Let's break down the key components of DRT.

### 1. **Discourse Representation Structures (DRS)**

A DRS consists of two primary parts:

1. **Universe (or discourse referents):** A set of variables representing entities or objects introduced in the discourse. These variables act as placeholders for individuals or objects being talked about.
2. **Conditions:** A set of logical conditions that describe properties of and relations between the discourse referents.

A DRS is often denoted as:

$$
\langle U, C \rangle
$$

- $U$ is the set of discourse referents (variables).
- $C$ is the set of conditions involving these referents.

#### Example 1: Single Sentence DRS

Consider the simple sentence: "A man walks."

1. Introduce a discourse referent $x$ for "a man."
2. Add conditions to the DRS specifying that $x$ is a man and that $x$ walks.

This could be represented as a DRS:

$$
\langle \{x\}, \{ \text{man}(x), \text{walks}(x) \} \rangle
$$

Here, $x$ is the discourse referent, and the conditions $\text{man}(x)$ and $\text{walks}(x)$ describe the properties of this referent.

#### Example 2: Extended Discourse with Anaphora

Now, consider a two-sentence discourse: "A man walks. He whistles."

1. The first sentence introduces a new referent $x$ for "a man."
2. The second sentence uses "he," which is an anaphoric reference to the previously mentioned "man" ($x$).

The combined DRS for this discourse might look like:

$$
\langle \{x\}, \{ \text{man}(x), \text{walks}(x), \text{whistles}(x) \} \rangle
$$

The crucial point is that the DRS tracks the discourse referent $x$ across the sentences, allowing for correct interpretation of the pronoun "he."

### 2. **DRT and Anaphora Resolution**

One of the strengths of DRT is its capacity to handle **anaphora** (e.g., pronouns like "he," "she," "it") by dynamically building the context in which each subsequent sentence is interpreted. In traditional formal semantics, sentences are often interpreted in isolation, making anaphora resolution challenging. DRT, however, accumulates information in the form of discourse referents and conditions, which subsequent sentences can reference.

In formal terms, DRT's process for resolving anaphora can be described as finding a discourse referent in the current DRS that satisfies the conditions imposed by the anaphoric expression. For example, when interpreting "he whistles," the theory searches for a suitable discourse referent already introduced (in this case, $x$ from "A man walks") to bind to "he."

### 3. **Complex DRSs and Embedding**

DRSs can be nested to handle more complex structures, such as conditionals, negations, and other subordinate clauses. This allows DRT to capture the compositional nature of natural language semantics. A **complex DRS** might include embedded DRSs to represent the scope of operators like negation, conditionals, or quantifiers.

#### Example: Conditional Sentences

Consider the sentence: "If a man walks, he whistles."

1. A DRS for the condition introduces a new referent $x$ for "a man" and asserts that $x$ walks.
2. The main DRS contains a conditional that embeds the DRS for the antecedent and describes what happens if the condition holds.

Formally, we might represent this as:

$$
\langle \emptyset, \{ \text{if } \langle \{x\}, \{ \text{man}(x), \text{walks}(x) \} \rangle \text{ then } \langle \{x\}, \{ \text{whistles}(x) \} \rangle \} \rangle
$$

Here, the overall DRS contains a conditional statement whose parts are themselves DRSs.

### 4. **Formal Semantics of DRT**

DRT aligns with **dynamic semantics**, where the meaning of sentences is understood in terms of how they update a discourse context. A DRS can be viewed as a function that transforms one context (a set of possible worlds and assignments for discourse referents) into another. The process of interpreting a discourse involves sequentially updating this context with each sentence's DRS.

Given a DRS $D = \langle U, C \rangle$, an **embedding function** maps the referents in $U$ to entities in the model. The conditions $C$ are evaluated relative to this embedding. A discourse is **coherent** if there exists an embedding that satisfies all conditions across the entire DRS.

### 5. **Applications and Extensions**

DRT has been extended and adapted to various domains of linguistic theory, including:

- **Temporal DRT:** Incorporates tense and aspect, allowing for the dynamic representation of time in discourse.
- **Modal DRT:** Introduces possible worlds to handle modality (e.g., possibility, necessity).
- **Presupposition and DRT:** Models how presuppositions (background assumptions) are introduced and resolved within discourse.

### Summary

In essence, DRT provides a powerful and flexible way to model natural language semantics, particularly in handling the dynamic aspects of meaning that emerge when sentences interact in a discourse. By representing the semantics of a discourse as a structured, updatable entity, DRT captures anaphora, quantifier scope, and other context-sensitive aspects more naturally than static formal semantic frameworks. 

Key terms like **discourse referents**, **conditions**, and **DRS embedding** are crucial for understanding the mechanics of DRT, which remains an influential approach in computational linguistics and formal semantics.
