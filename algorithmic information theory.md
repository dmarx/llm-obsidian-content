# Algorithmic Information Theory

[[Algorithmic Information Theory]] (AIT) provides a mathematical framework for analyzing the complexity of objects through the lens of computation, bridging [[information theory]], [[computability theory]], and [[statistical mechanics]].

## Core Concepts

### Kolmogorov Complexity

The [[Kolmogorov complexity]] K(x) of an object x is defined as:

K(x) = min{|p| : U(p) = x}

where:
- |p| denotes the length of program p
- U is a [[universal Turing machine]]
- U(p) represents the output of U when run on program p

This represents the length of the shortest program that produces x as its output.

### Algorithmic Probability

The [[algorithmic probability]] P(x) of an object x is defined as:

P(x) = ∑_{p:U(p)=x} 2^{-|p|}

This sum is taken over all programs p that produce x when run on U. The factor 2^{-|p|} assigns higher probability to shorter programs, implementing a formal version of [[Occam's Razor]].

## Fundamental Theorems

### Coding Theorem

The [[coding theorem]] establishes a deep connection between Kolmogorov complexity and algorithmic probability:

-log₂P(x) = K(x) + O(1)

This relationship demonstrates that high probability objects are precisely those with low Kolmogorov complexity.

### Incomputability Results

Let K_U(x) denote the Kolmogorov complexity relative to universal Turing machine U. Then:

1. K_U(x) is [[non-computable]]
2. There exists no algorithm that can compute K_U(x) for all inputs x
3. K_U(x) can only be approximated from above

## Applications

### Statistical Inference

AIT provides a foundation for [[algorithmic statistics]] through the notion of [[two-part codes]]:

K(x) ≈ K(M) + log|M|

where:
- M is a statistical model
- log|M| represents the cost of specifying x within model M
- K(M) represents the complexity of the model itself

### Pattern Detection

A sequence x contains a [[pattern]] if:

K(x) < |x|

where |x| is the length of x. This formalizes the intuition that patterns enable compression.

## Formal Measure of Randomness

### Martin-Löf Randomness

A sequence x is [[Martin-Löf random]] if:

K(x₁:n) ≥ n - c

for some constant c and all initial segments x₁:n, where:
- x₁:n denotes the first n bits of x
- n represents the length of the segment
- c is a small constant

### Algorithmic Mutual Information

The [[algorithmic mutual information]] between x and y is defined as:

I(x:y) = K(x) + K(y) - K(x,y)

This measures the information shared between x and y in terms of program length savings.

## Connections to Physics

### Maximum Entropy Principle

AIT provides a computational interpretation of [[Jaynes' Maximum Entropy Principle]]:

P(x) ∝ 2^{-K(x)}

This distribution maximizes algorithmic entropy subject to known constraints.

### Thermodynamic Depth

The [[thermodynamic depth]] D(x) of a state x is defined as:

D(x) = K(h) 

where h is the minimum complexity historical process leading to x.
