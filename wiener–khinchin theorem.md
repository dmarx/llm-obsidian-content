Wiener–Khinchin theorem


**ASSISTANT**

The Wiener–Khinchin theorem, also known as the Wiener–Khintchine theorem, is a fundamental result in the field of signal processing and stochastic processes. It establishes a connection between the autocorrelation function of a stationary random process and its power spectral density. This theorem is named after Norbert Wiener and Aleksandr Khinchin.

## Statement of the Theorem

For a wide-sense stationary (WSS) random process \( X(t) \) with mean \( \mathbb{E}[X(t)] = \mu \) and autocorrelation function \( R_X(\tau) \), the power spectral density \( S_X(f) \) is the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation function \( R_X(\tau) \). Mathematically, this is expressed as:

$$
S_X(f) = \mathcal{F}\{R_X(\tau)\} = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} R_X(\tau) e^{-j 2 \pi f \tau} \, d\tau
$$

where \( \mathcal{F}\{\cdot\} \) denotes the Fourier transform.

Conversely, the autocorrelation function \( R_X(\tau) \) can be obtained by the inverse Fourier transform of the power spectral density \( S_X(f) \):

$$
R_X(\tau) = \mathcal{F}^{-1}\{S_X(f)\} = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} S_X(f) e^{j 2 \pi f \tau} \, df
$$

## Proof Outline

The proof of the Wiener–Khinchin theorem involves several steps, including the use of properties of stationary processes and the application of the Fourier transform. Here's a sketch of the main ideas:

1. **Definition of the Autocorrelation Function**:
   The autocorrelation function \( R_X(\tau) \) of a stationary process \( X(t) \) is defined as:
   $$
   R_X(\tau) = \mathbb{E}[X(t)X(t+\tau)]
   $$

2. **Power Spectral Density**:
   The power spectral density \( S_X(f) \) describes how the power of the signal is distributed across different frequency components. It can be formally defined using the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation function.

3. **Fourier Transform Relationships**:
   By considering the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation function, one can show that the power spectral density is indeed its Fourier transform. This involves leveraging properties such as the stationarity of the process and the fact that the autocorrelation function is real and even.

## Applications

The Wiener–Khinchin theorem has numerous applications in various fields, including:

- **Signal Processing**: It is used in the analysis and design of filters, spectral estimation, and understanding the frequency characteristics of signals.
- **Communications**: Helps in analyzing the performance of communication systems, particularly in understanding noise and interference.
- **Physics and Engineering**: Used in the analysis of time series data, vibrations, and other phenomena that can be modeled as stationary random processes.

## Example

Consider a stationary random process with an autocorrelation function \( R_X(\tau) = e^{-\alpha |\tau|} \). Using the Wiener–Khinchin theorem, we can find its power spectral density.

First, compute the Fourier transform of \( R_X(\tau) \):

$$
S_X(f) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-\alpha |\tau|} e^{-j 2 \pi f \tau} \, d\tau
$$

This integral can be evaluated by splitting it into two parts for \( \tau \geq 0 \) and \( \tau < 0 \):

$$
S_X(f) = \int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-\alpha \tau} e^{-j 2 \pi f \tau} \, d\tau + \int_{-\infty}^{0} e^{\alpha \tau} e^{-j 2 \pi f \tau} \, d\tau
$$

After solving these integrals, we obtain:

$$
S_X(f) = \frac{\alpha}{\alpha^2 + (2\pi f)^2}
$$

Thus, the power spectral density \( S_X(f) \) of the process is a Lorentzian function centered at \( f = 0 \).

In summary, the Wiener–Khinchin theorem provides a powerful tool for connecting the time-domain and frequency-domain representations of stationary random processes, facilitating a deeper understanding and analysis of such processes in various applications.
