No-Deleting Theorem


**ASSISTANT**

The **No-Deleting Theorem** is a fundamental result in quantum information theory, closely related to the [[No-Cloning Theorem]]. It states that it is impossible to delete an unknown quantum state from one of two perfectly entangled copies of the state. This theorem emphasizes the preservation of information in quantum mechanics, underscoring the unique nature of quantum information compared to classical information, where data can be freely copied and deleted.

### Formal Statement of the No-Deleting Theorem

The No-Deleting Theorem asserts that for two copies of an arbitrary unknown quantum state $\ket{\psi}$, it is impossible to perform a quantum operation that deletes one copy while leaving the other copy unchanged, even if the operation is allowed to use an ancillary system.

More formally, if we have two identical quantum states, $\ket{\psi} \otimes \ket{\psi}$, there does not exist a unitary transformation $U$ and an ancillary state $\ket{A}$ such that for all possible states $\ket{\psi}$:

$$
U \left( \ket{\psi} \otimes \ket{\psi} \otimes \ket{A} \right) = \ket{\psi} \otimes \ket{0} \otimes \ket{A'},
$$

where $\ket{0}$ is some standard reference or blank state (representing the "deleted" state) and $\ket{A'}$ is the (possibly changed) state of the ancillary system. In other words, there is no universal unitary operation that can transform any two copies of a quantum state into one copy of the state and a fixed blank state.

### Proof Outline of the No-Deleting Theorem

The proof of the No-Deleting Theorem relies on the linearity and unitarity of quantum mechanics, similar to the proof of the [[No-Cloning Theorem]]. Hereâ€™s an outline of the proof by contradiction:

1. **Assume a Universal Deletion Operation**: Assume that there exists a universal unitary operation $U$ that deletes one copy of an arbitrary unknown quantum state $\ket{\psi}$, resulting in $\ket{\psi} \otimes \ket{0}$ for any $\ket{\psi}$.

2. **Apply the Operation to Two Different States**: Consider two different quantum states, $\ket{\psi}$ and $\ket{\phi}$. The assumed unitary deletion operation must satisfy:

   \[
   U \left( \ket{\psi} \otimes \ket{\psi} \otimes \ket{A} \right) = \ket{\psi} \otimes \ket{0} \otimes \ket{A'},
   \]

   and

   \[
   U \left( \ket{\phi} \otimes \ket{\phi} \otimes \ket{A} \right) = \ket{\phi} \otimes \ket{0} \otimes \ket{A'}.
   \]

3. **Consider Inner Products**: Compute the inner product of the two outcomes:

   \[
   \left( \bra{\psi} \otimes \bra{0} \otimes \bra{A'} \right) \left( U \left( \ket{\phi} \otimes \ket{\phi} \otimes \ket{A} \right) \right).
   \]

   Since $U$ is unitary, this can be rewritten as:

   \[
   \left( \bra{\psi} \otimes \bra{\psi} \otimes \bra{A} \right) \left( \ket{\phi} \otimes \ket{\phi} \otimes \ket{A} \right) = \braket{\psi | \phi}^2 \braket{A | A}.
   \]

   On the other hand, the inner product of the presumed outputs must be:

   \[
   \braket{\psi | \phi} \braket{0 | 0} \braket{A' | A'} = \braket{\psi | \phi} \braket{A' | A'}.
   \]

   Equating these two expressions gives:

   \[
   \braket{\psi | \phi}^2 \braket{A | A} = \braket{\psi | \phi} \braket{A' | A'}.
   \]

4. **Analyze the Contradiction**: For arbitrary states $\ket{\psi}$ and $\ket{\phi}$, the inner product $\braket{\psi | \phi}$ can take any value between 0 and 1. If $\braket{\psi | \phi} \neq 0$ and $\braket{\psi | \phi} \neq 1$, this implies that the absolute value $\left| \braket{\psi | \phi} \right|^2 \neq \left| \braket{\psi | \phi} \right|$, leading to a contradiction unless $\braket{\psi | \phi} = 0$ or $\braket{\psi | \phi} = 1$.

5. **Conclusion**: Since $\ket{\psi}$ and $\ket{\phi}$ can be any arbitrary quantum states, the assumption that a universal deletion operation $U$ exists leads to a contradiction. Therefore, such a unitary operation does not exist, proving the No-Deleting Theorem.

### Implications of the No-Deleting Theorem

The No-Deleting Theorem has several important implications in quantum information theory:

1. **Information Conservation**: The theorem reinforces the concept that quantum information cannot be arbitrarily deleted, mirroring the idea that quantum information is preserved in closed quantum systems. This is related to the unitarity of quantum evolution, which implies that information is conserved in a quantum system's state space.

2. **Quantum vs. Classical Information**: In classical information theory, data can be freely copied and deleted. However, in quantum mechanics, the no-cloning and no-deleting theorems highlight the unique behavior of quantum information, where neither perfect copying nor perfect deletion is possible. This distinction underscores the fundamental differences between quantum and classical information.

3. **Quantum Cryptography**: Just as the [[No-Cloning Theorem]] underpins the security of quantum key distribution (QKD) by preventing eavesdroppers from making perfect copies of quantum states, the No-Deleting Theorem adds another layer of security by ensuring that information, once encoded into quantum states, cannot be arbitrarily erased. This property can be utilized to develop cryptographic protocols that are robust against certain types of attacks.

4. **Thermodynamics of Information**: The No-Deleting Theorem is related to concepts in the thermodynamics of information. In classical thermodynamics, deleting information from a system is associated with an increase in entropy, as articulated in Landauer's principle. The quantum version implies that since deletion of arbitrary quantum states is impossible, the conservation of quantum information plays a role akin to entropy in quantum systems.

### Relation to Other Quantum Information Principles

1. **No-Cloning Theorem**: The No-Deleting Theorem is a counterpart to the No-Cloning Theorem. Together, these theorems establish that in the quantum world, information behaves very differently from the classical world: not only can quantum states not be copied perfectly, but they also cannot be deleted perfectly.

2. **No-Broadcasting Theorem**: The No-Broadcasting Theorem generalizes the No-Cloning Theorem to mixed states, stating that an unknown quantum state cannot be "broadcast" to multiple systems. It provides additional constraints on the manipulation and distribution of quantum information.

3. **Unitary Evolution**: The theorems arise from the linearity and unitarity of quantum mechanics, which ensure that the evolution of closed quantum systems preserves the inner products between states, maintaining the integrity of quantum information.

### Conclusion

The **No-Deleting Theorem** is a fundamental result in quantum information theory that complements the No-Cloning Theorem, highlighting the unique properties of quantum information. It demonstrates that quantum information cannot be arbitrarily erased, reinforcing the notion that quantum information is conserved. This theorem has significant implications for quantum computation, quantum cryptography, and our understanding of quantum mechanics, emphasizing the deep and sometimes counterintuitive nature of quantum theory.
