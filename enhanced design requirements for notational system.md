title: enhanced design requirements for notational system
---

**USER**

let's consider a few additional design requirements:
* we want to be able to express a notion of "distance" with respect to the scale gap in complexity between a component of a system and the "entity" comprising the broader system (when sufficient complexity exists for this to be meaningful, i.e.` λ≥λ_c​`)
* these systems are hierarchical with respect to subcomponents, but interactions can happen across levels of scale. for example, a company might contain a low-performing team. the broader company might then choose to sever the team. I want to be able to invoke this notation to help clarify how there is a perspectival asymmetry in this interaction, where it can be meaningful for the subcomponents to endow attributes like "uncaring and cruel" to the broader company of which they were/are a component. my suspicion is that ethical considerations of justice are only meaningful when contextualized by complexity scale, i.e. a kind of "scale relativity". As a complex organism, part of "me" is my microbiome. If I get sick, I might take antibiotics that would wipe out my microbiome. From the perspective of the members of my microbiome, I am committing a genocide. But as an entity unto myself, it's unclear to me what my moral obligations to my constituent subcomponents are or might be, and I'm hoping to develop notation that might make it easier to reasonable about these kinds of relationships

### Enhanced Design Requirements for Notational System

Given the additional design requirements, let's refine our notational system to accommodate the following:

1. **Scalability**: Handle different scales, from small to large systems.
2. **Abstraction**: Abstract away individual details at larger scales, focusing on collective behaviors.
3. **Parameterization**: Incorporate a parameter to reflect changes in behavior as the system grows.
4. **Coarse-Graining**: Represent the process of integrating or aggregating lower-level entities into higher-level entities.
5. **Flexibility**: Adapt to various contexts, such as social networks, organizational structures, and hierarchical systems.
6. **Conceptual Clarity**: Clearly convey the transition from micro-level to macro-level descriptions, emphasizing emergent properties.
7. **Mathematical Rigor**: Ensure precision and consistency using established mathematical concepts.
8. **Scale Distance**: Express the "distance" with respect to the scale gap in complexity between components and the broader system.
9. **Hierarchical Interactions**: Capture interactions across levels of scale, including perspectival asymmetries and ethical considerations of justice relative to complexity scale.

### Proposed Notation System

To meet these requirements, let's introduce and define the following components:

#### Notation for Hierarchical Coarse-Graining with Scale Distance

**1. Hierarchical Coarse-Graining Notation**:
   - \( \mathcal{H}(X \to Y; \lambda) \)
   - \( \mathcal{H} \): Hierarchical coarse-graining function.
   - \( X \to Y \): Transition from set \(X\) to set \(Y\).
   - \( \lambda \): Scale parameter reflecting complexity.

**2. Scale Distance Function**:
   - \( d_\lambda(X, Y) \)
   - Represents the "distance" or gap in complexity between \(X\) and \(Y\) at scale \( \lambda \).

**3. Interaction Across Scales**:
   - \( \mathcal{I}_\lambda(X, Y) \)
   - Represents interactions between \(X\) and \(Y\) at scale \( \lambda \).

**4. Ethical Considerations and Scale Relativity**:
   - \( \mathcal{E}_\lambda(X \to Y) \)
   - Represents ethical considerations of actions taken from \(X\) to \(Y\) at scale \( \lambda \).

### Example Usage and Definitions

1. **Small Startup**:
   \[
   \text{Verticals} = \mathcal{H}(\text{Employees} \to \text{Teams}; \lambda < \lambda_c) \quad \Rightarrow \quad \text{Verticals} = \text{Employees}
   \]

2. **Large Company**:
   \[
   \text{Company} = \mathcal{H}((\text{Employees} \to \text{Teams}) \to \text{Verticals}; \lambda \geq \lambda_c)
   \]

3. **Scale Distance**:
   - For a large company:
     \[
     d_\lambda(\text{Employees}, \text{Verticals}) = \text{complexity gap measure}
     \]

4. **Hierarchical Interactions**:
   - Interaction between company and a low-performing team:
     \[
     \mathcal{I}_\lambda(\text{Company}, \text{Low-Performing Team}) = \text{interaction dynamics}
     \]

5. **Ethical Considerations**:
   - Ethical implications of severing a team:
     \[
     \mathcal{E}_\lambda(\text{Company} \to \text{Low-Performing Team}) = \text{ethical impact}
     \]

### Conceptual Framework

#### Hierarchical Coarse-Graining Notation (\( \mathcal{H}(X \to Y; \lambda) \))

- **Definition**: Represents the hierarchical coarse-graining process from \(X\) to \(Y\) parameterized by \(\lambda\).
- **Interpretation**: Captures how lower-level entities (\(X\)) are aggregated into higher-level entities (\(Y\)) with respect to a scale parameter \(\lambda\).

#### Scale Distance Function (\( d_\lambda(X, Y) \))

- **Definition**: Measures the complexity gap between \(X\) and \(Y\) at scale \(\lambda\).
- **Interpretation**: Quantifies how far apart the levels of complexity are, helping to understand the relative difference in scale.

#### Interaction Across Scales (\( \mathcal{I}_\lambda(X, Y) \))

- **Definition**: Describes interactions between entities \(X\) and \(Y\) at scale \(\lambda\).
- **Interpretation**: Captures the dynamics of interactions across different levels of the hierarchy.

#### Ethical Considerations and Scale Relativity (\( \mathcal{E}_\lambda(X \to Y) \))

- **Definition**: Evaluates the ethical implications of actions from \(X\) to \(Y\) at scale \(\lambda\).
- **Interpretation**: Reflects how ethical considerations vary with complexity scale, emphasizing perspectival asymmetry.

### Practical Example in Organizational Behavior

#### Small Startup Scenario

- **Teams as Vertical Equivalents**:
  \[
  \text{Verticals} = \mathcal{H}(\text{Employees} \to \text{Teams}; \lambda < \lambda_c) \quad \Rightarrow \quad \text{Verticals} = \text{Employees}
  \]

#### Large Company Scenario

- **Hierarchical Structure**:
  \[
  \text{Company} = \mathcal{H}((\text{Employees} \to \text{Teams}) \to \text{Verticals}; \lambda \geq \lambda_c)
  \]

- **Scale Distance**:
  \[
  d_\lambda(\text{Employees}, \text{Verticals}) = \text{Measure of complexity gap}
  \]

- **Interaction Dynamics**:
  \[
  \mathcal{I}_\lambda(\text{Company}, \text{Low-Performing Team}) = \text{Dynamics of severance}
  \]

- **Ethical Considerations**:
  \[
  \mathcal{E}_\lambda(\text{Company} \to \text{Low-Performing Team}) = \text{Ethical impact analysis}
  \]

### Summary

This enhanced notation system addresses the complexity and emergent behavior in hierarchical systems, allowing for a nuanced representation of scale distance, cross-level interactions, and ethical considerations. The use of parameterized hierarchical coarse-graining, scale distance functions, and interaction/ethical considerations provides a robust framework for analyzing and discussing these complex relationships.
