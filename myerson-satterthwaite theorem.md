Myerson-Satterthwaite Theorem

### Myerson-Satterthwaite Theorem

The Myerson-Satterthwaite theorem is a fundamental result in [[mechanism design]] and economics that addresses the impossibility of achieving efficient trade in bilateral bargaining scenarios with private information. It shows that when two parties have private information about their valuations, it is impossible to design a mechanism that is simultaneously incentive-compatible, individually rational, and achieves efficient trade.

### Key Concepts

1. **Bilateral Trade**: A scenario where two parties, a buyer and a seller, engage in a trade of a single indivisible good.
2. **Private Information**: Each party has private knowledge of their own valuation for the good. The buyer knows their maximum willingness to pay, and the seller knows their minimum acceptable price.
3. **Incentive Compatibility**: A mechanism is incentive-compatible if each party's best strategy is to truthfully reveal their private information.
4. **Individual Rationality**: Each party should be at least as well off by participating in the mechanism as they would be by not participating.
5. **Efficiency**: The mechanism should maximize total surplus, meaning the good should be traded if and only if the buyer's valuation exceeds the seller's valuation.

### Formal Statement

Consider a buyer with a valuation \( v_B \) and a seller with a valuation \( v_S \) for an indivisible good. The valuations \( v_B \) and \( v_S \) are private information and are independently drawn from continuous probability distributions \( F_B \) and \( F_S \) with supports on \([0, \bar{v}_B]\) and \([0, \bar{v}_S]\) respectively.

The Myerson-Satterthwaite theorem states that there is no mechanism that satisfies the following three conditions simultaneously:

1. **Incentive Compatibility (IC)**: Each party is incentivized to truthfully reveal their private valuation.
2. **Individual Rationality (IR)**: Participation in the mechanism is voluntary, and each party should not be worse off by participating.
3. **Efficiency (E)**: The good is traded if and only if \( v_B > v_S \).

### Intuition and Implications

#### Intuition

The impossibility arises because achieving all three conditions would require the mechanism to balance the conflicting interests of the buyer and seller while also ensuring efficient trade. Incentive compatibility requires that each party has no incentive to misreport their valuation, but aligning this with efficiency and individual rationality leads to a fundamental conflict.

#### Implications

- **Inefficiency in Bilateral Trade**: It is impossible to design a mechanism that guarantees both truthfulness and efficiency without violating individual rationality. This leads to a potential loss of social welfare due to inefficient trade decisions.
- **Practical Mechanism Design**: Mechanism designers must make trade-offs among [[incentive compatibility]], individual rationality, and efficiency. For example, they might design mechanisms that are approximately efficient or that sacrifice some degree of individual rationality.

### Proof Sketch

The proof of the Myerson-Satterthwaite theorem involves demonstrating that any mechanism attempting to achieve [[incentive compatibility]], individual rationality, and efficiency must fail to meet at least one of these criteria due to the fundamental conflict between them. Here's a high-level outline of the proof:

1. **Incentive Compatibility**: Construct the mechanism such that each party truthfully reports their valuation.
2. **Individual Rationality**: Ensure that each party prefers participating in the mechanism to not participating.
3. **Efficiency**: The mechanism should trade the good if \( v_B > v_S \).

By analyzing the payments and transfers required to satisfy these conditions, it becomes apparent that there will always be scenarios where either:
- The buyer has an incentive to underreport their valuation to pay less.
- The seller has an incentive to overreport their valuation to receive more.
- The mechanism fails to trade the good when \( v_B > v_S \), leading to inefficiency.

### Example

Consider a simple example with a buyer and a seller, where:

- The buyer's valuation \( v_B \) is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1.
- The seller's valuation \( v_S \) is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1.

An efficient trade should occur if \( v_B > v_S \). However, to ensure [[incentive compatibility]], the mechanism must provide payments that align with the true valuations, which leads to either the buyer or seller having an incentive to misreport, violating [[incentive compatibility]] or individual rationality.

### Mechanism Design Strategies

Despite the impossibility result, there are strategies to design mechanisms that perform reasonably well in practice:

1. **Approximate Efficiency**: Mechanisms that achieve near-optimal efficiency while ensuring [[incentive compatibility]] and individual rationality.
2. **Subsidies and Taxes**: Introducing external subsidies or taxes to align incentives, although this may not always be feasible.
3. **Mediation**: Using a mediator to facilitate trade and ensure better alignment of incentives.

### Conclusion

The Myerson-Satterthwaite theorem highlights the inherent challenges in designing mechanisms for efficient bilateral trade with private information. It underscores the trade-offs between [[incentive compatibility]], individual rationality, and efficiency, driving mechanism designers to develop practical solutions that balance these conflicting requirements. Understanding this theorem is crucial for advancing theories and applications in economics, auctions, and public policy.
