**USER**

consider a membership network such that entity nodes are given by rows of the adjacency matrix and group membership is given by columns. Let's imagine this graph is students in some school district. we can construct a variety of different adjacency matrices using the same students on the rows for each and changing what kind of group membership the columns are describing for each adjacency matrix. so for example we might have one membership network for student clubs, another for teams, another for classes, etc. such that communities of different kinds can overlap and we describe the relationships between students not just as a single matrix but as a tensor where a particular dimension designates the relationship type associated with the adjacency matrix that slices that dimension. what's this kind of graph called? what are tools for analyzing these kinds of complex graphs?


**ASSISTANT**

The type of graph you are describing is known as a **multilayer network** or **multiplex network**. In a multilayer network, nodes can participate in multiple types of interactions, represented by different layers. Each layer corresponds to a different type of relationship or interaction among the same set of nodes.

### Multilayer Networks

#### Definition
A multilayer network is defined by a set of layers, each representing a different type of relationship. Formally, a multilayer network can be represented as a tensor \(\mathcal{A}\) where:
- \(\mathcal{A}_{ijk}\) indicates the presence (or weight) of an edge between node \(i\) and node \(j\) in layer \(k\).

In your example, nodes are students, and layers represent different types of memberships (e.g., clubs, teams, classes).

#### Mathematical Representation
If we have \(N\) nodes and \(M\) layers, the adjacency tensor \(\mathcal{A}\) is of size \(N \times N \times M\). Each slice \(\mathcal{A}_{::k}\) represents the adjacency matrix for layer \(k\), describing one type of relationship.

### Tools for Analyzing Multilayer Networks

Analyzing multilayer networks requires extending traditional graph theory concepts to handle the added complexity. Some of the tools and methods used include:

#### 1. **Multilayer Network Measures**
- **Degree and Strength**: Generalized to account for contributions from different layers. For a node \(i\), the degree can be defined for each layer \(k\) as \(d_i^{(k)} = \sum_j \mathcal{A}_{ijk}\).
- **Multilayer Clustering Coefficient**: Measures the tendency of nodes to form clusters across different layers.
- **Multilayer Betweenness and Centrality**: Extend the concepts of betweenness and centrality to account for paths that traverse multiple layers.

#### 2. **Community Detection**
Multilayer community detection algorithms identify groups of nodes that are densely connected within and across layers. Notable methods include:
- **Multilayer Modularity Maximization**: Extends the concept of modularity to multilayer networks by considering intra-layer and inter-layer edges.
- **Tensor Decomposition**: Techniques such as CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) and Tucker decomposition help uncover underlying structures in the adjacency tensor.

#### 3. **Random Walks and Diffusion**
Analyzing random walks and diffusion processes in multilayer networks helps understand how information or influence spreads through different types of relationships.

### Software and Libraries
Several software tools and libraries are available for analyzing multilayer networks:

- **Mucha et al.'s Infomap**: A popular algorithm for multilayer community detection.
- **Pymnet**: A Python library specifically designed for the analysis and visualization of multilayer networks.
- **MNE-Python**: A library for working with multilayer network data, particularly useful for neuroscience applications but also adaptable to other domains.
- **NetworkX**: While primarily designed for single-layer networks, NetworkX can be extended to handle multilayer networks through custom implementations.

### Applications
Multilayer networks are used in various fields:
- **Social Networks**: Analyzing social interactions across different platforms or contexts.
- **Biological Networks**: Studying interactions in biological systems, such as gene regulation and protein-protein interactions.
- **Transportation Networks**: Modeling multimodal transportation systems where different layers represent different modes of transport.

### Conclusion

Multilayer networks provide a powerful framework for analyzing complex systems where entities interact in multiple ways. By representing these interactions in a tensor form, researchers can gain deeper insights into the structure and dynamics of the network. Advanced tools and methodologies, including tensor decomposition, multilayer community detection, and specialized libraries, enable comprehensive analysis of these sophisticated networks.
