koopmann operator theory


**ASSISTANT**

**Koopman Operator Theory** provides a linear perspective on nonlinear dynamical systems by focusing on the evolution of observables rather than states. This theory uses the Koopman operator, an infinite-dimensional linear operator, to describe the dynamics of observables in a function space. Here, we explore the core concepts, mathematical foundations, and applications of Koopman operator theory.

### Core Concepts

1. **Observable Functions**: Observables are functions defined on the state space of the dynamical system. Instead of analyzing the state evolution directly, Koopman operator theory studies how these observables evolve.
2. **Koopman Operator**: For a dynamical system with state space $\mathbb{X}$ and flow map $\varphi^t$, the Koopman operator $\mathcal{K}^t$ acts on an observable $g: \mathbb{X} \to \mathbb{C}$ as:
   $$
   (\mathcal{K}^t g)(x) = g(\varphi^t(x)).
   $$
3. **Linearity**: The Koopman operator is linear, even if the underlying dynamical system is nonlinear. This linearity allows the use of spectral methods to analyze nonlinear systems.

### Mathematical Foundations

#### Definition and Properties

Given a dynamical system with a state space $\mathbb{X}$ and a flow map $\varphi^t: \mathbb{X} \to \mathbb{X}$, the Koopman operator $\mathcal{K}^t$ for an observable $g \in \mathcal{F}$, where $\mathcal{F}$ is a space of functions, is defined by:
$$
(\mathcal{K}^t g)(x) = g(\varphi^t(x)).
$$
Key properties of the Koopman operator include:

1. **Linearity**: For any observables $g_1, g_2 \in \mathcal{F}$ and scalars $a, b \in \mathbb{C}$:
   $$
   \mathcal{K}^t (a g_1 + b g_2) = a \mathcal{K}^t g_1 + b \mathcal{K}^t g_2.
   $$

2. **Composition**: The composition property of the flow map $\varphi^t$ translates into the Koopman operator as:
   $$
   \mathcal{K}^{t+s} = \mathcal{K}^t \mathcal{K}^s.
   $$

3. **Spectral Properties**: The spectral properties of the Koopman operator provide insights into the system's dynamics. Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions play a crucial role in understanding these properties.

#### Eigenvalues and Eigenfunctions

An eigenfunction $\phi$ of the Koopman operator with eigenvalue $\lambda$ satisfies:
$$
\mathcal{K}^t \phi = \lambda^t \phi.
$$
This implies that $\phi(x)$ evolves under the dynamics as:
$$
\phi(\varphi^t(x)) = \lambda^t \phi(x).
$$

The set of eigenvalues $\lambda$ and corresponding eigenfunctions $\phi$ provide a spectral decomposition of the Koopman operator, analogous to the decomposition of a matrix into its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

### Spectral Decomposition

The spectral decomposition of the Koopman operator allows us to express the evolution of observables in terms of Koopman modes. For an observable $g$, we can write:
$$
g(x) = \sum_{j=1}^\infty \phi_j(x) c_j,
$$
where $\phi_j$ are eigenfunctions of the Koopman operator, and $c_j$ are coefficients.

The evolution of $g$ under the Koopman operator is then:
$$
\mathcal{K}^t g(x) = \sum_{j=1}^\infty \lambda_j^t \phi_j(x) c_j.
$$

### Applications

1. **Data-Driven Modeling**: Techniques like [[Dynamic Mode Decomposition]] (DMD) use Koopman operator theory to extract dynamic modes from data, providing insights into the system's behavior.
2. **Control Theory**: Koopman operator theory helps in designing controllers for nonlinear systems by transforming them into linear problems.
3. **Robustness and Stability Analysis**: Analyzing the spectral properties of the Koopman operator can reveal the stability and robustness of fixed points and periodic orbits.
4. **Machine Learning**: In machine learning, Koopman operator theory is applied to feature extraction and dimensionality reduction.

### Example: Simple Harmonic Oscillator

Consider a simple harmonic oscillator with the state $\mathbf{x}(t) = [x(t), \dot{x}(t)]^T$ evolving according to:
$$
\ddot{x} + \omega^2 x = 0.
$$

The flow map $\varphi^t$ describes the evolution of the state over time. For an observable $g(x, \dot{x}) = x$, the Koopman operator $\mathcal{K}^t$ acts as:
$$
(\mathcal{K}^t g)(x, \dot{x}) = g(\varphi^t(x, \dot{x})).
$$

If we express $x(t)$ and $\dot{x}(t)$ in terms of eigenfunctions of $\mathcal{K}^t$, we obtain a spectral decomposition that reveals the oscillatory nature of the system through its eigenvalues and eigenfunctions.

### Conclusion

Koopman operator theory provides a robust framework for analyzing nonlinear dynamical systems using linear techniques. By focusing on the evolution of observables, it transforms the complex problem of nonlinear dynamics into a more tractable linear form, enabling a wide range of analytical and computational methods.
