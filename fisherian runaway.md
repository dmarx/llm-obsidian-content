**Fisherian Runaway**

Fisherian runaway, also known as Fisher's runaway selection, is a concept in sexual selection theory proposed by the geneticist [[Ronald Fisher]]. This process describes a positive feedback loop in which a particular trait and the preference for that trait both become more exaggerated over time. Fisherian runaway is a mechanism by which certain traits, often seemingly non-adaptive or even maladaptive, can evolve and become prominent within a population.

### Mechanism

The basic mechanism of Fisherian runaway can be summarized as follows:

1. **Initial Variation**: There is an initial variation in a sexually selected trait (e.g., peacock tail length) among males and a corresponding variation in female preference for this trait.
2. **Genetic Linkage**: The genes for the trait and the preference for the trait become genetically correlated. This can happen through assortative mating where females with a preference for the trait tend to mate with males possessing the trait, causing the traits to be inherited together.
3. **Positive Feedback Loop**: As the preference for the trait increases in the population, males with the trait gain a reproductive advantage. Consequently, these males have more offspring, further increasing the frequency of both the trait and the preference for it in the population.
4. **Runaway Process**: The trait and the preference co-evolve in a self-reinforcing cycle, leading to increasingly exaggerated forms of the trait, often beyond what might be considered optimal for survival.

### Mathematical Model

To formalize the Fisherian runaway process mathematically, consider the following model:

Let:
- \( z \) be the sexually selected trait in males.
- \( p \) be the preference for trait \( z \) in females.
- \( w(z, p) \) be the fitness function, incorporating both survival and reproductive success.

The key components of the model include:
- **Fitness Function**: 
  $$ w(z, p) = s(z) + r(z, p) $$
  where \( s(z) \) represents the survival component and \( r(z, p) \) represents the reproductive success component influenced by female preference \( p \).

- **Genetic Covariance**: 
  If the trait \( z \) and preference \( p \) are genetically correlated, let \( G \) be the genetic covariance matrix, with elements \( G_{zz} \), \( G_{zp} \), and \( G_{pp} \).

- **Evolutionary Dynamics**: 
  The evolutionary change in the mean trait and preference can be described by the multivariate breeder's equation:
  $$ \Delta \mathbf{z} = \mathbf{G} \mathbf{\beta} $$
  where \( \mathbf{z} = \begin{pmatrix} \bar{z} \\ \bar{p} \end{pmatrix} \) is the vector of mean trait and preference, and \( \mathbf{\beta} = \begin{pmatrix} \beta_z \\ \beta_p \end{pmatrix} \) is the selection gradient vector.

### Selection Gradient

The selection gradient \( \mathbf{\beta} \) is derived from the fitness function:
$$ \beta_z = \frac{\partial w}{\partial z} $$
$$ \beta_p = \frac{\partial w}{\partial p} $$

Given the fitness function \( w(z, p) \), we can determine the direction and magnitude of selection acting on the trait and preference. Positive feedback arises when:
- \( \frac{\partial w}{\partial z} > 0 \): An increase in the trait \( z \) leads to higher fitness due to increased reproductive success.
- \( \frac{\partial w}{\partial p} > 0 \): An increase in preference \( p \) also leads to higher fitness.

### Conclusion

Fisherian runaway illustrates how sexual selection can lead to extreme trait exaggeration through a feedback loop between trait and preference. This mechanism helps explain the evolution of conspicuous traits that might otherwise seem detrimental to survival, emphasizing the role of sexual selection in shaping biodiversity.
