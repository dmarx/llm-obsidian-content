Onsager Reciprocity Relations


**ASSISTANT**

The **Onsager reciprocity relations** are fundamental results in nonequilibrium thermodynamics, formulated by Lars Onsager in the 1930s. These relations describe the symmetry properties of the linear response coefficients in systems close to thermodynamic equilibrium. They provide a deep insight into the behavior of irreversible processes and are based on the microscopic reversibility of the underlying physical laws.

### Linear Irreversible Thermodynamics

In the linear regime close to equilibrium, the thermodynamic fluxes \(J_i\) (such as heat flow, particle flow, or electric current) are linearly related to the thermodynamic forces \(X_j\) (such as temperature gradient, chemical potential gradient, or electric field) driving them:
$$
J_i = \sum_j L_{ij} X_j,
```
where \(L_{ij}\) are the phenomenological coefficients that relate the forces to the fluxes.

### Onsager Reciprocity Relations

The Onsager reciprocity relations state that the matrix of phenomenological coefficients \(L_{ij}\) is symmetric, provided the underlying microscopic dynamics are time-reversible:
$$
L_{ij} = L_{ji}.
```
This symmetry results from the time-reversal invariance of the microscopic equations of motion, such as those described by classical mechanics or quantum mechanics.

### Derivation Outline

The derivation of Onsager reciprocity relations involves several key steps:

1. **Microscopic Reversibility**: Start with the assumption that the microscopic dynamics are time-reversible. This means the fundamental equations of motion (Newton's laws, Schr√∂dinger equation) are invariant under time reversal.

2. **Perturbation Theory**: Consider a small perturbation away from equilibrium, causing a slight deviation in the system. The response of the system can be studied using linear response theory.

3. **Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem**: Utilize the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, which relates the response of a system to external perturbations to its equilibrium fluctuations.

4. **Symmetry of Correlation Functions**: Show that the equilibrium correlation functions, which appear in the expressions for the phenomenological coefficients, exhibit symmetry properties under time reversal.

By carefully analyzing the symmetry properties of these correlation functions, one can derive the Onsager reciprocity relations.

### Applications

The Onsager reciprocity relations have broad applications in various fields of physics and chemistry, particularly in the study of transport phenomena.

1. **Thermoelectric Effects**: In thermoelectric materials, the relations describe the symmetry between the Seebeck effect (generation of electric current due to a temperature gradient) and the Peltier effect (heat flow due to an electric current).

2. **Thermodiffusion and Diffusion Thermo-Effect**: These relations apply to the cross-effects between thermal diffusion (Soret effect) and diffusion-induced thermal gradients (Dufour effect).

3. **Electrochemical Systems**: The reciprocity relations describe the coupling between ionic transport and electric currents in electrochemical cells.

4. **Biological Systems**: Onsager relations are used to model the transport of ions and molecules across biological membranes, where multiple coupled transport processes occur.

### Example: Coupled Heat and Particle Transport

Consider a system where both heat and particle transport occur, with heat flux \(J_q\) and particle flux \(J_n\) driven by temperature gradient \(\nabla T\) and chemical potential gradient \(\nabla \mu\):
$$
J_q = L_{qq} (-\nabla T) + L_{qn} (-\nabla \mu),
$$
$$
J_n = L_{nq} (-\nabla T) + L_{nn} (-\nabla \mu).
```

According to the Onsager reciprocity relations:
$$
L_{qn} = L_{nq}.
```

This symmetry implies that the cross-coupling coefficients between heat and particle transport are equal, reflecting the underlying time-reversal symmetry of the microscopic dynamics.

### Conclusion

The Onsager reciprocity relations are a cornerstone of nonequilibrium thermodynamics, providing profound insights into the symmetry properties of transport coefficients in systems near equilibrium. They illustrate the deep connection between microscopic time-reversibility and macroscopic irreversible processes.
