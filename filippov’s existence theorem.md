Filippov’s Existence Theorem


**ASSISTANT**

### Filippov’s Existence Theorem

Filippov's Existence Theorem is a fundamental result in the theory of differential inclusions. It guarantees the existence of solutions to differential inclusions under certain conditions. This theorem is particularly useful in dealing with systems where the right-hand side of the differential equation is discontinuous or set-valued.

### Statement of Filippov’s Existence Theorem

Consider the differential inclusion:
$$
\dot{x}(t) \in F(t, x(t)),
$$
where \( x(t) \in \mathbb{R}^n \) is the state vector, and \( F: \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^n \to 2^{\mathbb{R}^n} \) is a set-valued map. Filippov’s Existence Theorem states:

#### Theorem:
If the set-valued map \( F \) satisfies the following conditions:
1. **Measurability**: For each \( x \in \mathbb{R}^n \), the map \( t \mapsto F(t, x) \) is measurable.
2. **Upper Semicontinuity**: For each \( t \in \mathbb{R} \), the map \( x \mapsto F(t, x) \) is upper semicontinuous.
3. **Non-emptiness, Convexity, and Compactness**: For all \( (t, x) \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^n \), the set \( F(t, x) \) is non-empty, convex, and compact.
4. **Growth Condition**: There exists a function \( m(t) \in L^1([a, b], \mathbb{R}^+) \) such that:
   $$
   \|F(t, x)\| \leq m(t)(1 + \|x\|)
   $$
   for all \( (t, x) \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^n \).

Then, for any initial condition \( x(a) = x_0 \), there exists at least one absolutely continuous function \( x(t) \) that satisfies the differential inclusion almost everywhere on the interval \([a, b]\).

### Key Concepts and Definitions

#### Measurability
A set-valued map \( F: \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^n \to 2^{\mathbb{R}^n} \) is measurable if, for each \( x \in \mathbb{R}^n \), the set \( \{ t \mid F(t, x) \cap V \neq \emptyset \} \) is measurable for every open set \( V \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n \).

#### Upper Semicontinuity
A set-valued map \( F: \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^n \to 2^{\mathbb{R}^n} \) is upper semicontinuous at \( (t_0, x_0) \) if for any open set \( V \) containing \( F(t_0, x_0) \), there exists a neighborhood \( U \) of \( (t_0, x_0) \) such that \( F(t, x) \subseteq V \) for all \( (t, x) \in U \).

#### Convexity and Compactness
The set \( F(t, x) \) is convex if, for any \( u, v \in F(t, x) \) and \( \lambda \in [0, 1] \), the point \( \lambda u + (1 - \lambda) v \in F(t, x) \). It is compact if it is closed and bounded.

### Proof Outline

1. **Approximation by Simple Functions**:
   Approximate the set-valued map \( F(t, x) \) by a sequence of simple, measurable, set-valued maps \( F_n(t, x) \).

2. **Selection Theorem**:
   Use a measurable selection theorem to choose measurable selections \( f_n(t, x) \in F_n(t, x) \) such that \( f_n \to F \) as \( n \to \infty \).

3. **Compactness and Convexity**:
   Employ the convexity and compactness of \( F(t, x) \) to ensure that the sequence of approximate solutions \( x_n(t) \) has a convergent subsequence.

4. **Limit Function**:
   Show that the limit of this subsequence is an absolutely continuous function that satisfies the original differential inclusion almost everywhere.

### Applications

#### Control Theory

In control theory, differential inclusions model systems where control actions are not unique or are subject to uncertainty. Filippov's theorem ensures the existence of trajectories that respect the inclusion constraints.

#### Mechanical Systems with Discontinuities

Systems with impacts or dry friction, such as a bouncing ball or a Coulomb friction problem, are naturally modeled using differential inclusions. Filippov's theorem guarantees the existence of solutions despite the discontinuities.

#### Economic Models

In economic dynamics, where agents' decisions lead to non-unique outcomes, differential inclusions can represent such systems. Filippov's theorem provides a theoretical foundation for the existence of equilibrium trajectories.

### Example: Control-Affine Systems

Consider a control-affine system:
$$
\dot{x}(t) \in Ax(t) + B(t)U
$$
where \( U \) is a set of admissible controls, \( A \) is a constant matrix, and \( B(t) \) is a time-varying matrix. The set \( F(t, x) = Ax + B(t)U \) satisfies the conditions of Filippov’s theorem, ensuring the existence of solutions.

### Conclusion

Filippov’s Existence Theorem is a powerful result that extends the existence theory of differential equations to differential inclusions. By accommodating set-valued maps and nonsmooth dynamics, it provides a robust framework for analyzing and solving a wide range of problems in mathematics, engineering, and economics.
