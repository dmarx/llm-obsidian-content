### Fisher Information Metric and Potential Function in Binary Choice Models

The relationship between the Fisher information metric and the potential function in the context of binary choice models offers a profound geometric intuition into the structure of these models. Here's a deeper exploration:

#### Fisher Information Metric as the Hessian of the Potential Function

1. **Potential Function $\psi$**:
   - The potential function $\psi(\theta)$ is a scalar function that encapsulates the distribution's geometry with respect to its parameters $\theta$.
   - In a dually flat manifold, the potential function $\psi$ helps define both the metric and the dual coordinate system.

2. **Fisher Information Metric**:
   - The Fisher information metric $g_{ij}(\theta)$ is a Riemannian metric on the parameter manifold, quantifying the amount of information each parameter holds about the observed data.
   - Mathematically, it is given by:
     $$
     g_{ij}(\theta) = E \left[ \frac{\partial \log P(y | x, \theta)}{\partial \theta_i} \frac{\partial \log P(y | x, \theta)}{\partial \theta_j} \right]
     $$
   - Alternatively, it can be expressed as the negative expectation of the second derivative of the log-likelihood function:
     $$
     g_{ij}(\theta) = -E \left[ \frac{\partial^2 \log P(y | x, \theta)}{\partial \theta_i \partial \theta_j} \right]
     $$

3. **Metric as the Hessian of the Potential Function**:
   - The Fisher information metric is the Hessian of the potential function $\psi(\theta)$:
     $$
     g_{ij}(\theta) = \frac{\partial^2 \psi(\theta)}{\partial \theta_i \partial \theta_j}
     $$
   - This means that $g_{ij}(\theta)$ is derived from the second-order partial derivatives of $\psi$, providing a measure of curvature in the parameter space.

### Geometric Interpretation

1. **Curvature of the Manifold**:
   - The Hessian structure implies that the metric captures how the manifold curves in the parameter space. A zero curvature (flat manifold) indicates that the space is locally Euclidean.
   - In a dually flat manifold, the potential function $\psi$ creates a coordinate system where the curvature tensor vanishes, simplifying the geometry and making it analogous to Euclidean space.

2. **Dual Coordinates and Potential Function**:
   - The dual coordinates $\eta$ are related to the natural parameters $\theta$ through the potential function $\psi$:
     $$
     \eta_i = \frac{\partial \psi(\theta)}{\partial \theta_i}
     $$
   - The dual potential function $\psi^*(\eta)$ is the Legendre transform of $\psi(\theta)$:
     $$
     \psi^*(\eta) = \sup_\theta \left( \sum_i \eta_i \theta_i - \psi(\theta) \right)
     $$
   - This relationship ensures a symmetric and flat geometry in the dual coordinate system.

### Application to the Logit Model

1. **Logit Model Specifics**:
   - In the logit model, the choice probability is defined by the logistic function:
     $$
     P(y = 1 | x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\beta^T x}}
     $$
   - Here, $\theta = \beta$ are the parameters, and the potential function $\psi(\beta)$ corresponds to the log-partition function of the logistic distribution.

2. **Fisher Information Matrix for the Logit Model**:
   - For the logit model, the Fisher information matrix $I(\beta)$ can be explicitly computed and is derived from the second derivatives of the potential function $\psi(\beta)$:
     $$
     I(\beta) = \int \frac{e^{\beta^T x}}{(1 + e^{\beta^T x})^2} x x^T dP(x)
     $$
   - This matrix is the Hessian of the potential function, confirming the geometric structure.

### Conclusion

The potential function $\psi$ and its Hessian structure provide a fundamental understanding of the Fisher information metric and the curvature of the parameter space in binary choice models. In the logit model, this relationship simplifies many geometric and statistical computations, offering insights into the model's efficiency and robustness. The geometric intuition helps clarify why the logit model, in particular, has such advantageous properties in statistical modeling and inference.
