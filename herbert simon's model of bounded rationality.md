### Herbert Simon's Model of Bounded Rationality

Herbert A. Simon introduced the concept of **bounded rationality** to describe how people make decisions within the constraints of limited information, cognitive capacity, and time. Simon's model stands in contrast to the classical economic assumption of perfect rationality, where decision-makers are assumed to have unlimited cognitive abilities and access to all relevant information.

### Key Concepts

1. **Bounded Rationality**: Decision-makers operate under constraints that limit their ability to process information and make optimal decisions. These constraints include limited cognitive resources, incomplete information, and finite time.
2. **Satisficing**: Instead of seeking the optimal solution, individuals aim for a solution that is "good enough" to meet their aspirations or needs. This is a combination of "satisfy" and "suffice."
3. **Sequential Search**: Individuals often evaluate options sequentially rather than simultaneously, stopping the search when an acceptable option is found.
4. **Heuristics**: Simple, rule-of-thumb strategies or mental shortcuts used to make decisions more manageable under conditions of bounded rationality.

### Simon's Decision-Making Process

Simon proposed a three-stage model of decision-making:

1. **Intelligence**: Identifying and understanding the problem. This involves gathering information about the environment and recognizing the need for a decision.
2. **Design**: Developing and exploring possible solutions. This stage involves generating alternative courses of action and evaluating their feasibility.
3. **Choice**: Selecting a satisfactory solution. In this stage, the decision-maker chooses the first option that meets their criteria for acceptability rather than the optimal one.

### Detailed Stages

#### 1. Intelligence

In the intelligence stage, decision-makers:
- Gather information about the environment.
- Identify the problem or opportunity that requires a decision.
- Define the objectives and criteria for a satisfactory solution.

#### 2. Design

During the design stage, decision-makers:
- Generate a set of possible solutions or actions.
- Analyze and evaluate the alternatives based on the defined criteria.
- Use heuristics to simplify the evaluation process when dealing with complex problems.

#### 3. Choice

In the choice stage, decision-makers:
- Apply the [[satisficing]] principle, selecting the first option that meets the minimum acceptable criteria.
- Implement the chosen solution.
- Monitor the outcome and, if necessary, return to the intelligence or design stage for further refinement.

### Mathematical Formalism

To formalize Simon's concept of [[satisficing]], consider a decision-maker choosing between actions $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ with corresponding payoffs $u(a_i)$. The decision-maker has an aspiration level $A$, which represents the minimum acceptable payoff.

The [[satisficing]] decision rule is:

$$
a_S = \min \{a_i \mid u(a_i) \geq A\}
$$

where $a_S$ is the first action that satisfies the aspiration level $A$. This rule implies that the search for alternatives stops as soon as an acceptable option is found.

### Example

Consider a manager choosing a supplier for a component. The manager evaluates suppliers sequentially and has an aspiration level for quality, cost, and delivery time. Instead of comparing all suppliers simultaneously, the manager selects the first supplier that meets the minimum acceptable criteria for all three factors.

1. **Intelligence**: The manager gathers information on available suppliers and defines the criteria for an acceptable supplier.
2. **Design**: The manager generates a list of potential suppliers and evaluates them one by one.
3. **Choice**: The manager selects the first supplier that meets the defined criteria for quality, cost, and delivery time.

### Implications and Applications

#### 1. **Organizational Behavior**
In organizations, managers often make decisions under conditions of bounded rationality, using [[satisficing]] and heuristics to navigate complex environments.

#### 2. **Public Policy**
Policymakers use bounded rationality to design policies that account for the cognitive limitations and heuristics of individuals, aiming to create environments that guide people towards better decisions.

#### 3. **Consumer Behavior**
Consumers use [[satisficing]] and heuristics to make purchasing decisions, often relying on brand loyalty, price anchors, or recommendations rather than exhaustive comparisons.

### Conclusion

Herbert Simon's model of bounded rationality provides a realistic framework for understanding decision-making processes in complex and uncertain environments. By acknowledging cognitive limitations and the use of heuristics, this model offers valuable insights into how individuals and organizations make decisions in practice. The concepts of [[satisficing]] and sequential search are particularly important for explaining why decision-makers often settle for good-enough solutions rather than seeking the optimal outcome. This approach has broad applications across various fields, from organizational behavior to public policy and consumer behavior.
