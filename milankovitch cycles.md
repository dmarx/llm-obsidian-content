### Milankovitch Cycles

The term "Milankovitch cycles" refers to the collective effects of changes in the Earth's movements on its climate over tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years. Named after the Serbian astronomer and geophysicist [[Milutin Milankovitch]], these cycles describe the variations in the Earth's orbit and axial tilt that influence climatic patterns. The primary components of the Milankovitch cycles are eccentricity, axial tilt (obliquity), and precession.

#### Eccentricity
Eccentricity describes the shape of the Earth's orbit around the Sun, which varies from nearly circular to more elliptical over a period of about 100,000 years. The eccentricity \( e \) of an elliptical orbit is defined as:

$$
e = \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{b^2}{a^2} \right)}
$$

where \( a \) is the semi-major axis and \( b \) is the semi-minor axis of the ellipse. Changes in eccentricity alter the distance between the Earth and the Sun, affecting the distribution of solar radiation received by the Earth.

#### Axial Tilt (Obliquity)
The Earth's axial tilt, or obliquity, is the angle between the Earth's rotational axis and its orbital plane. This angle varies between about 22.1° and 24.5° over a period of approximately 41,000 years. The tilt angle \( \theta \) can be expressed as:

$$
\theta(t) = \theta_0 + A \cos\left( \frac{2\pi t}{T} + \phi \right)
$$

where \( \theta_0 \) is the mean tilt, \( A \) is the amplitude of variation, \( T \) is the period (41,000 years), and \( \phi \) is the phase. Variations in obliquity affect the intensity of the seasons, with greater tilt causing more extreme seasonal contrasts.

#### Precession
Precession refers to the gradual wobble in the orientation of the Earth's rotational axis, which changes the timing of the seasons relative to the Earth's position in its orbit. This cycle has a period of about 23,000 years and can be described by the precession angle \( \psi \):

$$
\psi(t) = \psi_0 + B \sin\left( \frac{2\pi t}{T} + \phi \right)
$$

where \( \psi_0 \) is the initial precession angle, \( B \) is the amplitude, \( T \) is the period (23,000 years), and \( \phi \) is the phase. Precession affects the distribution of solar radiation between the hemispheres and over the year.

#### Combined Effects
The combination of these three cycles influences the Earth’s climate by modulating the solar radiation received at different latitudes and seasons. The cumulative effect can be mathematically modeled by combining the individual contributions of eccentricity \( E(t) \), obliquity \( O(t) \), and precession \( P(t) \):

$$
Q(t) = Q_0 \left( 1 + \alpha E(t) + \beta O(t) + \gamma P(t) \right)
$$

where \( Q(t) \) is the insolation (incoming solar radiation) at a given time \( t \), \( Q_0 \) is the baseline insolation, and \( \alpha, \beta, \gamma \) are coefficients that quantify the contributions of each cycle.

Understanding Milankovitch cycles is crucial for explaining the timing of the [[ice age cycles]] and other long-term climate changes observed in the Earth's geological record.
