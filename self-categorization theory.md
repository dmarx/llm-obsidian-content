Self-Categorization Theory

### Self-Categorization Theory

**Self-Categorization Theory** (SCT) is a psychological framework developed by [[John Turner]], [[Henri Tajfel]], and their colleagues, building on the foundations of social identity theory. SCT focuses on how individuals categorize themselves and others into groups, and how these categorizations influence their perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors.

#### Key Concepts

1. **Social Categories**: The classification of people into groups based on shared characteristics or attributes.
2. **Depersonalization**: The process by which individuals perceive themselves and others more as prototypical group members rather than as unique individuals.
3. **Prototypes**: Cognitive representations of the typical attributes and behaviors of group members.
4. **Salience**: The degree to which a particular social category is prominent or relevant in a given context.
5. **Social Identity**: The part of an individualâ€™s self-concept derived from their membership in social groups.
6. **Self-Enhancement**: The motivation to maintain a positive self-concept through group membership.

#### Processes of Self-Categorization

##### Categorization

Individuals categorize themselves and others into social groups based on salient features such as race, gender, occupation, or nationality. These categories help simplify the social environment by providing clear distinctions between different groups.

**Example**: In a workplace, employees might categorize themselves based on departmental affiliations (e.g., marketing, finance, engineering).

##### Depersonalization

Once categorized, individuals undergo depersonalization, viewing themselves and others less as unique individuals and more as representatives of their respective groups. This process leads to the adoption of group norms and behaviors.

**Example**: A person might see themselves primarily as a "marketer" rather than as an individual with unique traits, conforming to the typical behaviors and attitudes of marketers.

##### Prototyping

Prototypes are mental representations of the ideal or typical attributes of a group member. These prototypes guide behavior and perception, serving as benchmarks for evaluating oneself and others.

**Example**: In the marketing department, the prototype might be someone who is creative, outgoing, and adept at understanding consumer behavior.

##### Salience

The salience of a social category depends on contextual factors such as the presence of outgroups or specific situational cues. Categories become more salient when they are relevant to the context or when intergroup comparisons are prominent.

**Example**: During a company-wide competition between departments, departmental identities become more salient, and employees identify more strongly with their respective departments.

##### Social Identity and Self-Enhancement

Through self-categorization, individuals derive part of their self-concept from their group memberships. They seek to enhance their self-esteem by favorably comparing their ingroups to relevant outgroups.

**Example**: A marketer might derive pride and self-esteem from the belief that the marketing department is more innovative and effective than other departments.

#### Empirical Evidence

##### Experimental Studies

Numerous experiments have validated the principles of SCT. For instance, the minimal group paradigm experiments by Tajfel demonstrated that even arbitrary group assignments could lead to ingroup favoritism and outgroup discrimination.

**Example**: Participants in these studies were assigned to groups based on trivial criteria (e.g., preference for paintings) and showed favoritism towards their own group members in reward distribution tasks.

##### Real-World Applications

SCT has been applied to understand various social phenomena, including intergroup conflict, stereotyping, and organizational behavior.

**Example**: In organizational settings, SCT helps explain how departmental identities influence cooperation and competition within companies.

### Theoretical Implications

#### Relation to Social Identity Theory

SCT complements social identity theory by providing a detailed account of the cognitive processes underlying group identification. While social identity theory focuses on the motivations for group behavior (e.g., self-esteem), SCT explains the mechanisms of categorization and depersonalization.

#### Influence on Group Behavior

SCT elucidates how group behavior is influenced by the salience of social categories and the adoption of group prototypes. It explains why individuals conform to group norms and how intergroup comparisons drive social behavior.

### Mathematical Modeling

To model the processes described by SCT, we can use formal methods from cognitive science and network theory.

#### Cognitive Modeling

Cognitive models simulate the mental processes involved in categorization, prototyping, and depersonalization.

**Prototype Formation**:
Let \(P(g)\) be the prototype of group \(g\), defined as the average of the attributes \(A_i\) of its members \(i\):

$$
P(g) = \frac{1}{N_g} \sum_{i \in g} A_i
$$

Where \(N_g\) is the number of members in group \(g\).

**Categorization Process**:
The probability \(P(c_i = g)\) that an individual \(i\) categorizes themselves as a member of group \(g\) can be modeled based on the similarity \(S\) between their attributes \(A_i\) and the group prototype \(P(g)\):

$$
P(c_i = g) = \frac{S(A_i, P(g))}{\sum_{h} S(A_i, P(h))}
$$

Where \(S(A_i, P(g))\) is a similarity function, such as the cosine similarity or Euclidean distance.

#### Network Theory

In a social network \(G = (V, E)\), where \(V\) represents individuals and \(E\) represents social connections, self-categorization can influence the structure and dynamics of the network.

**Group Formation**:
Nodes (individuals) form edges (connections) based on shared group memberships and category salience.

**Ingroup and Outgroup Ties**:
The probability of forming an edge \(e_{ij}\) between nodes \(i\) and \(j\) depends on whether they belong to the same group and the salience of that group:

$$
P(e_{ij}) = \alpha \cdot I(c_i = c_j) + \beta \cdot S(c_i, c_j)
$$

Where:
- \(\alpha\) represents the weight of ingroup connections.
- \(\beta\) represents the influence of category salience.
- \(I\) is an indicator function that is 1 if \(c_i = c_j\) and 0 otherwise.
- \(S(c_i, c_j)\) measures the similarity between the categories of \(i\) and \(j\).

### Conclusion

**Self-Categorization Theory** provides a comprehensive framework for understanding how individuals classify themselves and others into social groups and how these classifications influence perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors. By emphasizing processes like depersonalization, prototyping, and salience, SCT offers insights into group dynamics and intergroup relations. Empirical evidence from experimental studies and real-world applications, along with mathematical modeling, supports the robustness and utility of SCT in explaining social behavior.
