Tactical voting


**ASSISTANT**

**Tactical voting** (also known as strategic voting) occurs when a voter does not vote for their most preferred candidate or party but instead votes for a less preferred option that they perceive has a better chance of winning or influencing the election outcome. Tactical voting often arises in electoral systems where the voting rules create incentives for voters to cast their ballots in a way that maximizes the impact of their vote rather than expressing their genuine preference.

## Types of Tactical Voting

There are several common types of tactical voting, each based on different electoral contexts and strategies:

1. **Compromise Voting**: This occurs when a voter supports their second-choice candidate over their favorite because they believe the favorite has little chance of winning. The goal is to prevent the least preferred candidate from winning by boosting the chances of a more viable candidate.

   - **Example**: In a three-candidate race under a [[First-Past-the-Post]] (FPTP) system, if a voter's most preferred candidate (Candidate A) is unlikely to win, they might vote for their second choice (Candidate B) who has a better chance of defeating the least preferred candidate (Candidate C).

2. **Insincere Voting**: Voters deliberately choose a candidate who is not their true favorite to influence the election result in a specific way. This can be done to create a more favorable matchup in a later stage of the election or to disrupt the chances of a strong competitor.

   - **Example**: In a two-round system, voters may vote for a weaker candidate in the first round to ensure a more favorable matchup in the second round against a stronger opponent.

3. **Push-Over Voting**: Voters may vote for a weak candidate, hoping that this candidate will face their actual preferred candidate in a runoff or general election. The strategy assumes that the weak candidate will be easier to defeat later on.

   - **Example**: In primary elections or caucuses, voters might choose a candidate they believe will be less competitive in the general election against their preferred major party candidate.

4. **Desertion Voting**: In multi-member districts or proportional representation systems, a voter may vote for a party or candidate with a higher chance of passing a threshold or winning seats, even if it is not their top choice. This is done to avoid wasting their vote on a party that is unlikely to secure representation.

   - **Example**: In a proportional representation system with a 5% threshold, a voter may choose to support a party polling close to the threshold rather than a smaller party unlikely to reach it, to ensure their vote contributes to the overall allocation of seats.

## Factors Encouraging Tactical Voting

Several electoral system features and political contexts can encourage tactical voting:

1. **[[First-Past-the-Post]] (FPTP) System**: Tactical voting is particularly common in FPTP systems because only the candidate with the most votes wins, regardless of whether they have an absolute majority. This can lead to the **spoiler effect**, where votes for less popular candidates split the vote, potentially allowing a less favored candidate to win.

2. **Two-Round Systems**: In elections with two rounds (or a runoff system), voters might strategically vote for a candidate in the first round whom they believe can make it to the second round and have a better chance of winning against their most feared opponent.

3. **Threshold Requirements**: In systems with electoral thresholds (e.g., proportional representation systems requiring parties to secure a minimum percentage of votes to gain seats), voters may tactically choose parties near the threshold to ensure their votes are not wasted.

4. **Dominant Party Systems**: In political contexts where a single party is dominant, voters may engage in tactical voting to ensure that opposition votes consolidate around a viable challenger, rather than being split among multiple weaker opposition parties.

5. **Polarized Elections**: In highly polarized environments, voters may vote tactically to prevent the victory of a strongly opposed candidate or party, even if it means supporting a less preferred but more moderate option.

## Effects of Tactical Voting

Tactical voting can have several effects on electoral outcomes and the broader political landscape:

1. **Distorted Representation**: Tactical voting can lead to election results that do not accurately reflect the true preferences of the electorate. For example, a candidate who wins due to tactical voting may not be the genuinely most preferred candidate of the majority.

2. **Reinforcement of Two-Party Systems**: In FPTP and similar systems, tactical voting often leads to the concentration of votes around two major parties, reinforcing a two-party system and marginalizing smaller parties.

3. **Reduction of Polarization**: In some cases, tactical voting can reduce polarization by supporting more moderate candidates who have broader appeal, thereby preventing extreme candidates from winning.

4. **Incentivization of Negative Campaigning**: Candidates and parties may focus on negative campaigning and fear tactics to encourage tactical voting against their opponents, rather than campaigning on positive policies and platforms.

## Examples of Tactical Voting

- **United Kingdom**: Tactical voting is relatively common in UK general elections, especially in constituencies where one party is dominant, and opposition voters must decide whether to back a stronger challenger from another party.

- **France**: In the French presidential election's two-round system, voters often tactically vote in the first round to ensure a desirable candidate reaches the runoff.

- **United States**: Although FPTP is used in most U.S. elections, tactical voting can be seen in primary elections. For instance, during the Democratic and Republican primaries, voters may strategically choose a candidate they believe will have a better chance of winning the general election or defeating a particular opponent.

## Mitigating Tactical Voting

Some alternative voting systems aim to reduce the incentives for tactical voting:

1. **[[Ranked-Choice Voting]] (RCV)**: Voters rank candidates in order of preference, and if no candidate receives a majority, the least popular candidate is eliminated, and their votes are transferred according to voters' next preferences. This reduces the need for compromise voting, as voters can safely rank their true preferences without worrying about wasting their vote.

2. **[[Approval Voting]]**: Voters can vote for as many candidates as they approve of, reducing the spoiler effect and encouraging voters to support all candidates they find acceptable.

3. **[[Proportional Representation]] (PR)**: In PR systems, parties receive seats proportional to their share of the vote, reducing wasted votes and the need for tactical voting to ensure representation.

4. **[[Single Transferable Vote]] (STV)**: In multi-member districts, voters rank candidates, and surplus votes and votes for eliminated candidates are transferred according to preferences, reducing the spoiler effect and encouraging more sincere voting.

## Conclusion

Tactical voting is a common phenomenon in electoral systems with incentives that encourage voters to prioritize influencing the outcome over expressing their genuine preferences. While it can lead to strategic outcomes that align with voters' broader goals, it also has the potential to distort representation and reduce the expression of true public opinion. Alternative voting systems aim to mitigate these issues by allowing for more expressive and representative voting behavior.
