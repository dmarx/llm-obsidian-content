## Character Development in Improv

### Definition

**Character development** in improv refers to the process of creating and evolving a character over the course of a scene or series of scenes. This involves giving the character depth, consistency, and believability through their actions, dialogue, and interactions with other characters.

### Key Elements of Character Development

1. **Backstory**:
    - The character's history, experiences, and background that inform their behavior and motivations.
    - Example: A character who grew up on a farm might be resourceful and have a strong work ethic.

2. **Objectives and Motivations**:
    - What the character wants to achieve (objectives) and why they want to achieve it (motivations).
    - Example: A character might want to win a contest (objective) because they need the prize money to pay for a loved one's medical bills (motivation).

3. **Personality Traits**:
    - The character's distinctive qualities, such as being brave, shy, arrogant, or kind.
    - Example: A character who is overly confident might take bold risks, often leading to humorous or dramatic consequences.

4. **Emotional Depth**:
    - The character's capacity for a range of emotions and how they express and manage these emotions.
    - Example: A character might put on a brave face in public but show vulnerability in private moments.

5. **Relationships**:
    - The connections and dynamics between the character and other characters in the scene.
    - Example: A character might have a contentious relationship with their sibling, leading to frequent arguments but also moments of deep care.

### Techniques for Developing Characters

1. **Character Profiles**:
    - Create detailed profiles for characters, including their backstory, traits, and objectives.
    - Exercise: Write a profile for a character, detailing their age, occupation, hobbies, fears, and a significant event from their past.

2. **Hot Seating**:
    - Performers take turns sitting in the "hot seat" to be interviewed as their character, answering questions about their life and motivations.
    - Exercise: Interview a character about their childhood, aspirations, and relationships to uncover deeper layers of their personality.

3. **Role Reversal**:
    - Performers switch roles to explore different perspectives and deepen their understanding of their characters.
    - Exercise: Play a scene where performers switch characters halfway through, maintaining consistency and adapting to the new role.

4. **Emotion Underneath**:
    - Practice revealing the character’s true emotions beneath their words and actions.
    - Exercise: Perform a scene where a character says one thing but their body language and tone reveal a different underlying emotion.

5. **Monologues**:
    - Have characters deliver monologues to express their inner thoughts and feelings, providing insight into their motivations and conflicts.
    - Exercise: Create a monologue for a character reflecting on a pivotal moment in their life, revealing their internal struggles and desires.

### Practical Application in Improv Scenes

1. **Consistency in Behavior**:
    - Maintain consistent character traits and behaviors throughout the scene to build believability.
    - Example: If a character starts as meticulous and detail-oriented, they should continue to show these traits even in stressful situations.

2. **Dynamic Evolution**:
    - Allow characters to evolve in response to events and interactions within the scene.
    - Example: A shy character might gradually become more assertive after overcoming several challenges.

3. **Objective-Driven Actions**:
    - Characters should pursue their objectives, driving the plot and creating conflict.
    - Example: A character determined to find a lost treasure might clash with others who want to abandon the quest.

4. **Relatable Emotions**:
    - Characters should display genuine emotions that the audience can relate to, enhancing engagement and empathy.
    - Example: A character expressing heartfelt joy at a reunion with a long-lost friend can evoke strong emotions from the audience.

5. **Complex Relationships**:
    - Develop nuanced relationships between characters, showing different facets of their personalities.
    - Example: Two characters might have a love-hate relationship, bickering constantly but showing deep loyalty in times of crisis.

### Exercises to Practice Character Development

1. **Backstory Creation**:
    - Develop detailed backstories for characters, including key life events, relationships, and turning points.
    - Exercise: Write a timeline of significant events in a character’s life and how these events shaped their current personality.

2. **Inner Monologue**:
    - Perform scenes where characters verbalize their inner thoughts, providing insight into their motivations and emotions.
    - Exercise: Have characters narrate their thoughts while performing a mundane task, revealing their internal struggles or joys.

3. **Emotional Range**:
    - Practice portraying a wide range of emotions with the same character, showing their complexity.
    - Exercise: Perform a scene where a character experiences a series of emotional highs and lows, adapting their behavior and dialogue accordingly.

4. **Relationship Dynamics**:
    - Focus on building and exploring relationships between characters, highlighting their development.
    - Exercise: Perform scenes where the relationship between two characters changes drastically due to an event or revelation.

### Summary

Character development in improv involves creating rich, believable characters with detailed backstories, clear objectives, distinct personality traits, emotional depth, and complex relationships. Techniques like character profiles, hot seating, role reversal, emotion underneath, and monologues help performers flesh out their characters. Effective character development enhances scenes by maintaining consistency, allowing dynamic evolution, driving actions through objectives, displaying relatable emotions, and building complex relationships. Regular practice through targeted exercises helps performers deepen their character work, resulting in more engaging and authentic performances.
