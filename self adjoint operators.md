Self adjoint operators


**ASSISTANT**

Self-adjoint operators are fundamental in functional analysis and quantum mechanics due to their well-behaved spectral properties. They generalize the concept of symmetric matrices to infinite-dimensional spaces, ensuring real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenfunctions.

### Definition

An operator $\mathcal{L}$ on a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ is **self-adjoint** if it equals its own adjoint:
$$
\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}^*
$$
This means that for all $f, g \in \mathcal{H}$,
$$
\langle \mathcal{L} f, g \rangle = \langle f, \mathcal{L} g \rangle
$$
where $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle$ denotes the inner product in $\mathcal{H}$.

### Properties

1. **Real Eigenvalues**: If $\mathcal{L}$ is self-adjoint, all its eigenvalues $\lambda$ are real.
2. **Orthogonal Eigenfunctions**: Eigenfunctions corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal:
   $$
   \langle y_m, y_n \rangle = 0 \quad \text{if} \quad \lambda_m \neq \lambda_n
   $$
3. **Complete Set of Eigenfunctions**: The set of eigenfunctions of a self-adjoint operator forms a complete basis for the Hilbert space, allowing any function in the space to be expanded in terms of these eigenfunctions.
4. **Spectral Theorem**: For a self-adjoint operator $\mathcal{L}$, there exists a spectral decomposition:
   $$
   \mathcal{L} = \int_\sigma \lambda \, dE(\lambda)
   $$
   where $\sigma$ is the spectrum of $\mathcal{L}$ and $E(\lambda)$ is a projection-valued measure.

### Examples

1. **Differential Operators**: Many differential operators are self-adjoint when equipped with appropriate boundary conditions.
   - **Sturm-Liouville Operators**: Given by
     $$
     \mathcal{L} y = -\frac{d}{dx} \left( p(x) \frac{dy}{dx} \right) + q(x) y
     $$
     with boundary conditions ensuring self-adjointness, such as Dirichlet or Neumann conditions.
   - **Laplace Operator**: In a bounded domain $\Omega$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions, the Laplace operator $\Delta$ is self-adjoint:
     $$
     \Delta y = \nabla \cdot \nabla y
     $$
   
2. **Finite-Dimensional Example**: Consider a symmetric matrix $A$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$:
   $$
   A = A^T
   $$
   This matrix is self-adjoint in the finite-dimensional inner product space $\mathbb{R}^n$ with the standard dot product.

### Self-Adjoint Extensions

Not all symmetric operators are self-adjoint, but they can often be extended to self-adjoint operators. For a symmetric operator $\mathcal{L}$, there exists a self-adjoint extension $\mathcal{L}_{\text{ext}}$ such that:
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{ext}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{ext}}^*
$$
An important result is the **von Neumann's theorem** on self-adjoint extensions, which gives conditions for the existence and uniqueness of such extensions.

### Applications

1. **Quantum Mechanics**: In quantum mechanics, observables are represented by self-adjoint operators. The Hamiltonian operator, which describes the total energy of the system, is a prime example.
2. **Vibration Analysis**: The study of natural frequencies and modes of a vibrating system involves self-adjoint differential operators.
3. **Signal Processing**: Self-adjoint operators arise in the analysis of linear systems and signal transformations.

### Conclusion

Self-adjoint operators are central to understanding the behavior of linear systems in both finite and infinite-dimensional spaces. They provide a robust framework for analyzing eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, ensuring real spectra and orthogonality, which are crucial for both theoretical investigations and practical applications.
