Cognitive load refers to the amount of mental effort being used in the working memory. In the context of instructional design, cognitive load theory suggests that learners can absorb and retain information more effectively when the material is presented in a way that does not overload their cognitive capabilities. The theory categorizes cognitive load into three main types: intrinsic, extraneous, and germane.

### Intrinsic Cognitive Load

Intrinsic cognitive load is determined by the inherent difficulty of the material being learned, which is related to its complexity and the learner's prior knowledge. The complexity of a task is often associated with the number of elements that must be simultaneously processed in the working memory. Mathematically, we could conceptualize intrinsic load as a function of the complexity ($C$) of the material and the learner's prior knowledge ($K$):

$$L_{\text{intrinsic}} = f(C, K)$$

Where:
- $L_{\text{intrinsic}}$ is the intrinsic cognitive load,
- $C$ is the complexity of the material, and
- $K$ is the learner's prior knowledge.

### Extraneous Cognitive Load

Extraneous cognitive load is generated by the manner in which information is presented to the learner. This form of cognitive load does not contribute to learning and is often considered as a form of "noise" that can be minimized or eliminated through effective instructional design. For example, unnecessary decorative graphics or irrelevant information can increase the extraneous load. It can be represented as:

$$L_{\text{extraneous}} = g(P)$$

Where:
- $L_{\text{extraneous}}$ is the extraneous cognitive load, and
- $P$ represents the presentation of the material.

### Germane Cognitive Load

Germane cognitive load pertains to the mental resources devoted to the processing, construction, and automation of schemas. Schemas are structured patterns of thought that help individuals organize and interpret information. Investing cognitive resources in schema creation and automation facilitates learning and problem-solving. Thus, germane load is considered beneficial for learning:

$$L_{\text{germane}} = h(S, E)$$

Where:
- $L_{\text{germane}}$ is the germane cognitive load,
- $S$ represents the schemas being constructed, and
- $E$ is the effort put into constructing and automating these schemas.

### Total Cognitive Load

The total cognitive load experienced by a learner at any moment is the sum of these three types of loads:

$$L_{\text{total}} = L_{\text{intrinsic}} + L_{\text{extraneous}} + L_{\text{germane}}$$

It's critical that instructional materials and learning environments are designed to manage these three types of cognitive load effectively. Doing so can enhance learning by ensuring that the intrinsic load matches the learner's current level of knowledge, minimizing extraneous load, and maximizing germane load through activities that promote schema construction and automation.

In designing educational materials, understanding and applying principles from cognitive load theory can be essential. For instance, [[Split-Attention Effect|split-attention effect]] and [[Worked-Example Effect|worked-example effect]] are two phenomena explained by cognitive load theory, offering insights into how instructional materials should be designed to optimize learning outcomes.
