democratic backsliding in the international environment


**ASSISTANT**

**Democratic backsliding** refers to the erosion or weakening of democratic institutions, processes, and norms within a country, often resulting in a shift towards more authoritarian forms of governance. In the international context, this phenomenon has become increasingly prominent over the past few decades, affecting not just individual states but also the broader geopolitical landscape. Here, I will break down the core elements and mechanisms of democratic backsliding as it manifests on the international stage, as well as its causes, consequences, and interplay with global institutions.

## 1. **Mechanisms of Democratic Backsliding**

Democratic backsliding can occur through several interrelated mechanisms:

- **Executive Aggrandizement**: Leaders concentrate power by undermining the independence of other branches of government, such as the judiciary or the legislature. This might involve altering constitutions, extending term limits, or weakening checks and balances, all while maintaining a facade of legality.
- **Erosion of Electoral Integrity**: Manipulation of electoral processes, including vote tampering, disenfranchisement, and media control, reduces the ability of citizens to freely and fairly elect their leaders. This shifts regimes from competitive democracies to semi-authoritarian states.
- **Curtailment of Civil Liberties and Media Freedom**: Suppression of independent media, censorship, and the targeting of journalists or activists lead to an environment where opposition voices are marginalized, and public discourse is manipulated to favor the incumbent regime.
- **Judicial Capture and Corruption**: By filling courts with loyalists or undermining the rule of law, regimes can ensure that legal and institutional checks no longer constrain their power.

On the international level, these mechanisms interact with and are influenced by other states and international organizations, leading to what can be described as the globalization of authoritarian tactics.

## 2. **Causes of Democratic Backsliding**

The international environment is shaped by both structural and agency-based factors that contribute to democratic backsliding:

- **Globalization and Economic Inequality**: While globalization has lifted millions out of poverty, it has also led to rising economic inequality within countries. This economic discontent can be leveraged by populist leaders who frame their platforms as defenses against global elites or exploit nationalist sentiments.
- **Erosion of Liberal Democratic Norms**: The decline in the global consensus on the superiority of liberal democracy has emboldened regimes that might otherwise face international isolation. The shifting power dynamics, particularly the rise of authoritarian powers like China and Russia, provide alternative models to Western-style democracy.
- **Diffusion of Authoritarian Strategies**: Authoritarian regimes often share tactics and best practices, creating a transnational web of influence that promotes democratic backsliding. For instance, digital surveillance and disinformation techniques developed in one state are frequently adopted by others.
- **Weaknesses of International Institutions**: Organizations such as the United Nations or regional bodies like the European Union often lack the enforcement mechanisms to effectively counter democratic backsliding. In some cases, authoritarian states within these organizations wield enough influence to block punitive measures against backsliders.

## 3. **International Dimensions and Spillover Effects**

The international environment both shapes and is shaped by democratic backsliding:

### 3.1. **Geopolitical Realignments**
Countries experiencing democratic backsliding may shift their foreign policy alignments, seeking support from other non-democratic states to resist pressure from democratic countries or international organizations. For example:
- **Russia's Influence**: Russia has supported authoritarian leaders and movements across Europe, Africa, and Asia as part of its strategy to weaken democratic norms and institutions, thus expanding its sphere of influence.
- **China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)**: China provides economic investments and development aid without attaching political conditions (e.g., demands for democratization). This approach contrasts with Western aid, which often comes with stipulations for good governance, thus offering autocratic leaders an alternative source of international support.

### 3.2. **Erosion of International Norms**
When major powers and international institutions fail to respond effectively to democratic backsliding, it sets a precedent that others can follow. Examples include:
- **Hungary and Poland in the EU**: These countries have experienced significant democratic backsliding, particularly in terms of judicial independence and media freedom. The EU’s limited ability to respond decisively has demonstrated the difficulties of enforcing democratic standards even within supposedly strong regional institutions.
- **Venezuela’s Crisis and the OAS**: The Organization of American States (OAS) has struggled to respond to Venezuela’s democratic decline, partly due to the influence of member states with vested interests and the complexities of regional politics.

### 3.3. **Diffusion of Authoritarian Technology**
The international proliferation of surveillance technologies has facilitated democratic backsliding:
- **Surveillance Exportation**: Countries like China and Israel export advanced surveillance systems, which are then used by other states to suppress opposition and monitor civil society. This tech-based diffusion of authoritarianism creates a global marketplace for tools that undermine democratic norms.
- **Digital Disinformation**: Techniques developed by Russia, such as troll farms and disinformation campaigns, have been adopted by other regimes to undermine electoral integrity and manipulate public opinion domestically and internationally.

## 4. **Consequences for the International Order**

Democratic backsliding has broad implications for the global political environment:

- **Decline in Global Democratic Governance**: The rise in authoritarian regimes undermines international efforts to promote human rights, transparency, and accountability, weakening the global democratic governance framework.
- **Impact on Security Alliances**: Democracies typically form alliances based on shared values and governance structures. As democratic backsliding spreads, these alliances face strain; for example, NATO’s unity has been tested by the erosion of democratic norms in member states like Turkey.
- **Undermining of International Legal Norms**: Authoritarian states increasingly challenge international legal norms, such as those concerning freedom of the press or civil rights, influencing multilateral bodies like the United Nations to adopt watered-down positions.

## 5. **Responses to Democratic Backsliding**

The international community has various tools to address democratic backsliding, though their effectiveness varies:

- **Sanctions and Diplomatic Pressure**: Targeted sanctions and diplomatic isolation have been used against backsliding states, though these measures often have limited impact without broad multilateral support.
- **Support for Civil Society and Democratic Movements**: International organizations and democracies can provide funding, training, and support to local actors and civil society organizations working to resist authoritarian tendencies. However, these efforts often face repression by the very regimes they seek to counter.
- **Normative Pressure and Naming and Shaming**: Prominent international actors and institutions frequently use normative pressure to isolate and criticize backsliding regimes. The effectiveness of this strategy largely depends on the international consensus, which has weakened in recent years.

## 6. **Conclusion**

Democratic backsliding in the international environment is not just a domestic phenomenon; it is a transnational process influenced by a complex interplay of economic, geopolitical, and technological factors. As the liberal international order faces increasing challenges, the trend of democratic erosion signals a shift towards a more multipolar and ideologically diverse global landscape, requiring new strategies and cooperation among democratic states and institutions to counter these trends.
