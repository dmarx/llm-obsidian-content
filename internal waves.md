### Internal Waves

**Internal waves** are waves that propagate within the ocean, rather than on its surface, occurring at the interface between layers of water with different densities. These density differences typically arise due to variations in temperature (thermocline) or salinity (halocline). Internal waves are an important aspect of ocean dynamics, contributing to the mixing of ocean layers, the distribution of nutrients, and the overall energy balance within the ocean.

### Formation and Mechanism

1. **Density Stratification**:
   - Internal waves form in stratified fluids where the water density changes with depth. This stratification is often due to temperature differences (thermocline) or salinity gradients (halocline).
   - **Thermocline**: A layer in the ocean where the temperature changes rapidly with depth, leading to a strong density gradient.
   - **Halocline**: A layer where the salinity changes sharply with depth, also contributing to density differences.

2. **Generation of Internal Waves**:
   - **Tidal Forces**: Internal waves are commonly generated by the interaction of tidal currents with underwater topography such as continental shelves, seamounts, or ridges. The oscillatory motion of tides over these features causes disturbances in the stratified layers, generating internal waves.
   - **Wind Forcing**: Winds can also generate internal waves by exerting stress on the ocean surface, which propagates downward into the thermocline.
   - **Currents and Eddies**: The flow of ocean currents and eddies over varying bathymetry can disturb the stratified layers, creating internal waves.
   - **Convective Instabilities**: Internal waves can also form due to localized density instabilities, where denser water overlays less dense water, leading to convective mixing and wave generation.

3. **Wave Propagation**:
   - Internal waves propagate along the interface between layers of different densities, with the wave motion being much slower than that of surface waves. Their speed depends on the strength of the density gradient and the wavelength of the wave.
   - **Vertical Displacement**: Unlike surface waves, internal waves cause vertical displacement of water parcels within the ocean. This displacement can be significant, especially near the pycnocline, where the density gradient is strongest.

### Characteristics of Internal Waves

1. **Wavelength and Period**:
   - **Wavelength**: Internal waves can have very long wavelengths, ranging from hundreds of meters to hundreds of kilometers. Their horizontal extent is often much larger than that of surface waves.
   - **Period**: The period of internal waves can vary from minutes to hours, or even days, depending on the generating forces and the characteristics of the stratified layers.

2. **Amplitude**:
   - Internal waves often have large amplitudes, especially in deep water where the density gradients are weak. In some cases, the vertical displacement of water parcels can reach tens of meters or more.

3. **Wave Speed**:
   - The speed of internal waves is generally much slower than that of surface waves and depends on the density difference between the layers and the wavelength of the wave. For example, typical internal wave speeds range from a few centimeters per second to several meters per second.

4. **Nonlinear Effects**:
   - In certain conditions, internal waves can become nonlinear, leading to the formation of solitary waves (internal [[solitons]]). These [[solitons]] maintain their shape over long distances and are often observed in shallow coastal regions.

5. **Wave Breaking and Mixing**:
   - Internal waves can break, similar to surface waves, when they encounter steep topography or when their amplitude becomes too large. This breaking leads to significant vertical mixing of water masses, contributing to the redistribution of heat, nutrients, and dissolved gases within the ocean.

### Examples and Observations

1. **Oceanic Internal Waves**:
   - **Straits and Shelves**: Internal waves are commonly observed in straits and over continental shelves, where tidal currents interact with the seabed. Notable examples include the Luzon Strait between Taiwan and the Philippines and the Monterey Submarine Canyon off California.
   - **Equatorial Regions**: The equatorial regions often host large internal waves due to the strong stratification and the interaction of ocean currents with underwater topography.

2. **Luzon Strait**:
   - One of the most famous examples of large internal waves is found in the Luzon Strait, where tidal currents interacting with the underwater ridges generate some of the largest internal waves observed, with amplitudes exceeding 100 meters.

3. **Solitary Internal Waves**:
   - Internal [[solitons]] are often observed in shallow coastal regions, such as the Andaman Sea. These solitary waves can travel long distances and are important in coastal [[oceanography]] due to their ability to transport energy and mix water masses.

### Importance of Internal Waves

1. **Mixing and Nutrient Distribution**:
   - Internal waves play a crucial role in vertical mixing within the ocean, bringing nutrients from deeper layers to the surface, where they can support biological productivity. This mixing is essential for maintaining the nutrient balance in the photic zone, where photosynthesis occurs.

2. **Energy Transfer**:
   - Internal waves contribute to the transfer of energy from the tides and winds to the deep ocean. This energy is dissipated through [[wave breaking]] and mixing, influencing the global circulation and heat distribution in the ocean.

3. **Climate Impact**:
   - By mixing water layers and redistributing heat, internal waves can impact ocean circulation patterns and, consequently, the global climate system. They are particularly important in maintaining the [[thermohaline circulation]], which is a key driver of the global climate.

4. **Acoustic Propagation**:
   - Internal waves can influence the propagation of sound in the ocean, which is important for submarine navigation and underwater communication. The vertical displacement caused by internal waves creates variations in sound speed, which can lead to refraction and scattering of acoustic signals.

5. **Coastal Processes**:
   - In coastal regions, internal waves can influence sediment transport, erosion, and the dynamics of nearshore currents. Their breaking can also contribute to the formation of features such as ripples and sand dunes on the seabed.

### Observation and Measurement

1. **Satellite Imagery**:
   - Internal waves can sometimes be detected from space by satellite imagery, particularly synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical sensors, which capture surface manifestations of the internal waves, such as changes in surface roughness or slicks.

2. **In-Situ Measurements**:
   - **CTD Profilers**: Instruments that measure conductivity, temperature, and depth are used to detect internal waves by observing changes in water properties across different depths.
   - **Moorings**: Fixed instruments deployed in the ocean that continuously measure temperature, salinity, and pressure at various depths can record the passage of internal waves.
   - **Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs)**: ADCPs measure the velocity of water currents at different depths, providing data on the speed and direction of internal waves.

3. **Numerical Modeling**:
   - Numerical models simulate the generation, propagation, and breaking of internal waves, helping scientists understand their dynamics and predict their impact on ocean mixing and circulation.

### Conclusion

**Internal waves** are a fundamental aspect of ocean dynamics, occurring within the oceanâ€™s interior and playing a significant role in vertical mixing, nutrient distribution, and energy transfer. These waves, generated by tidal forces, wind, and ocean currents, influence various oceanic processes, from maintaining the [[thermohaline circulation]] to affecting coastal ecosystems and acoustic propagation. The study of internal waves is crucial for understanding the complex interactions within the ocean and their broader implications for the global climate and marine environments. Advances in observation techniques and numerical modeling continue to enhance our knowledge of internal waves and their impact on the ocean system.
