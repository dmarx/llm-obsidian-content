title: a lot of that really wasn't relevant at all.

**USER**

a lot of that really wasn't relevant at all.


**ASSISTANT**

The user is right - I got carried away with a lot of mathematical formalism and detailed theoretical aspects that aren't really central to what quaternary structure actually is. They were asking for a wiki entry on quaternary structure, and I provided a lot of tangential material about thermodynamics, graph theory, information theory, etc. that, while potentially related, isn't the core content that should be in a quaternary structure entry.

Let me focus on what quaternary structure actually is:
1. The arrangement of multiple polypeptide chains
2. The types of assemblies (dimers, tetramers, etc.)
3. The interfaces between subunits
4. The symmetries commonly observed
5. How subunits interact
6. Examples of important quaternary structures
7. How it relates to function

I should cut out most of the tangential mathematical formalism and focus on the core structural biology concepts.# Quaternary Structure

## Definition

[[Quaternary structure]] refers to the spatial arrangement and interactions between multiple polypeptide chains (subunits) that associate to form a functional protein complex. Unlike [[tertiary structure]], which describes the folding of a single chain, quaternary structure emerges from the assembly of independently folded [[protein domains]] or subunits.

## Subunit Organization

### Homomeric Complexes
[[Homomeric complexes]] consist of identical subunits. Common stoichiometries include:

- **Dimers** ($A_2$): two identical subunits
- **Trimers** ($A_3$): three identical subunits  
- **Tetramers** ($A_4$): four identical subunits
- **Higher oligomers** ($A_n$): larger assemblies

### Heteromeric Complexes
[[Heteromeric complexes]] contain different subunit types:

- **Heterodimers** ($AB$): two different subunits
- **Mixed oligomers** ($A_mB_n$): multiple copies of different subunits

## Symmetry Relationships

### Point Group Symmetries
Quaternary structures often exhibit [[crystallographic symmetries]]:

- **$C_2$**: 2-fold rotational symmetry (most dimers)
- **$C_3$**: 3-fold rotational symmetry (trimers)
- **$D_2$**: dihedral symmetry with three perpendicular 2-fold axes
- **$D_4$**: 4-fold symmetry with perpendicular 2-fold axes

### Asymmetric Assemblies
Not all complexes exhibit symmetry. [[Asymmetric quaternary structures]] often reflect functional requirements or evolutionary constraints.

## Interface Types

### Subunit Interfaces
[[Protein-protein interfaces]] can be characterized by:

- **Interface area**: typically 1200-2000 Ų for stable complexes
- **Shape complementarity**: geometric fit between subunit surfaces
- **Hydrophobic patches**: burial of hydrophobic surface area
- **Hydrogen bonding networks**: stabilizing polar interactions
- **Salt bridges**: electrostatic interactions across interfaces

### Interface Classification
Interfaces are classified as:

- **Obligate**: subunits cannot exist independently in vivo
- **Non-obligate**: subunits remain stable when separated
- **Domain-swapped**: structural domains exchange between subunits

## Functional Roles

### Allosteric Regulation
Quaternary structure enables [[allosteric communication]] between subunits. Conformational changes in one subunit propagate to others, allowing:

- **Cooperative binding**: enhanced affinity upon initial ligand binding
- **Negative cooperativity**: reduced affinity after initial binding
- **Conformational switching**: global structural transitions

### Active Site Formation
Some [[catalytic sites]] form at subunit interfaces, requiring quaternary assembly for function.

### Stability and Regulation
Quaternary structure provides:

- **Enhanced thermodynamic stability**
- **Protection from proteolysis**
- **Regulation through assembly/disassembly**

## Assembly Mechanisms

### Constitutive Assembly
Some complexes assemble [[co-translationally]] or immediately after translation and remain stably associated.

### Regulated Assembly
[[Dynamic assembly]] responds to:

- **Ligand binding**
- **Post-translational modifications**
- **Cellular localization signals**
- **Environmental conditions** (pH, ionic strength, temperature)

## Structural Examples

### Hemoglobin
The [[hemoglobin tetramer]] ($\alpha_2\beta_2$) exhibits:

- **$D_2$ symmetry**
- **Two types of interfaces**: $\alpha_1\beta_1$ and $\alpha_1\beta_2$
- **Allosteric oxygen binding**
- **Quaternary state transitions** (T-state ↔ R-state)

### Immunoglobulins
[[Antibodies]] display $(H_2L_2)$ stoichiometry with:

- **Inter-chain disulfide bonds**
- **Variable domain pairing**
- **Constant domain interactions**

### Virus Capsids
[[Viral capsids]] demonstrate [[icosahedral symmetry]] with 60 identical environments, often constructed from multiples of 60 subunits following [[quasi-equivalence]] principles.

## Evolutionary Perspectives

### Gene Duplication
Many quaternary structures arise through [[gene duplication]] followed by:

- **Subfunctionalization**: division of ancestral functions
- **Neofunctionalization**: acquisition of new functions
- **Dosage effects**: increased gene product levels

### Domain Swapping
[[3D domain swapping]] can create quaternary structures through:

- **Hinge region flexibility**
- **Identical domain interfaces**
- **Concentration-dependent equilibria**

## Experimental Determination

### X-ray Crystallography
[[Crystal structures]] reveal quaternary arrangements but may be influenced by:

- **Crystal packing forces**
- **Crystallization conditions**
- **Symmetry operators** of the space group

### Solution Methods
[[Analytical ultracentrifugation]], [[dynamic light scattering]], and [[size exclusion chromatography]] determine:

- **Molecular weight** of native complexes
- **Association constants**
- **Stoichiometry** in solution

### Cross-linking Mass Spectrometry
[[Chemical cross-linking]] combined with mass spectrometry maps:

- **Inter-subunit contacts**
- **Distance constraints**
- **Dynamic interface regions**

## Symbolic Notation

For quaternary structure representation:

- $\mathcal{Q}$: complete quaternary assembly
- $n$: number of subunits
- $\sigma$: symmetry group
- $\mathcal{I}_{ij}$: interface between subunits $i$ and $j$
- $K_a$: association constant for assembly

## Pathological Quaternary Structures

### Protein Aggregation
Aberrant quaternary structures in [[amyloid formation]] and [[inclusion bodies]] represent misfolded assemblies leading to disease states.

### Cancer-Related Alterations
Mutations affecting quaternary structure can disrupt:

- **Tumor suppressor complexes**
- **DNA repair machinery**
- **Cell cycle checkpoints**
