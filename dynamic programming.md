Dynamic programming (DP) is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems, solving each subproblem just once, and storing their solutions. This approach is particularly useful for optimization problems where the problem can be decomposed into overlapping subproblems.

## Principles of Dynamic Programming

### Overlapping Subproblems

Dynamic programming is applicable when a problem can be broken down into subproblems that are reused multiple times. For example, the Fibonacci sequence demonstrates overlapping subproblems because the calculation of $F(n)$ involves the calculation of $F(n-1)$ and $F(n-2)$, which in turn involve the calculation of smaller Fibonacci numbers.

### Optimal Substructure

A problem exhibits optimal substructure if an optimal solution to the problem contains optimal solutions to its subproblems. This means the overall optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems.

## Steps to Apply Dynamic Programming

1. **Define the Subproblems**: Identify and clearly define the subproblems in terms of the original problem.
2. **Formulate the Recurrence Relation**: Develop a recurrence relation that expresses the solution of the original problem in terms of solutions to its subproblems.
3. **Choose a Memoization Strategy**: Decide between a top-down approach ([[recursion]] with memoization) or a bottom-up approach (iterative tabulation).
4. **Implement the Solution**: Code the solution using the chosen memoization strategy.

## Example: Fibonacci Sequence

### Top-Down Approach (Recursion with Memoization)

In the top-down approach, we solve the problem recursively and use a dictionary or array to store the solutions of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.

```python
def fibonacci_memo(n, memo={}):
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    memo[n] = fibonacci_memo(n-1, memo) + fibonacci_memo(n-2, memo)
    return memo[n]
```

### Bottom-Up Approach (Iterative Tabulation)

In the bottom-up approach, we iteratively solve all subproblems starting from the smallest one and store their solutions in a table.

```python
def fibonacci_dp(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    
    fib = [0] * (n + 1)
    fib[1] = 1
    
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        fib[i] = fib[i - 1] + fib[i - 2]
    
    return fib[n]
```

This approach has a time complexity of $O(n)$ and space complexity of $O(n)$.

## Example: Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)

The LCS problem is to find the longest subsequence common to two sequences. This problem can be solved using dynamic programming.

### Recursive Definition

Let $X$ and $Y$ be two sequences of lengths $m$ and $n$, respectively. Define $L(i, j)$ as the length of the LCS of the prefixes $X[1..i]$ and $Y[1..j]$. The recurrence relation is:

$$
L(i, j) = 
\begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } i = 0 \text{ or } j = 0 \\
L(i-1, j-1) + 1 & \text{if } X[i] = Y[j] \\
\max(L(i-1, j), L(i, j-1)) & \text{if } X[i] \ne Y[j]
\end{cases}
$$

### Bottom-Up Implementation

```python
def lcs(X, Y):
    m, n = len(X), len(Y)
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
    
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if X[i - 1] == Y[j - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])
    
    return dp[m][n]
```

This approach has a time complexity of $O(m \cdot n)$ and space complexity of $O(m \cdot n)$.

## Key Applications of Dynamic Programming

### [[Optimization Problems]]

Dynamic programming is widely used in optimization problems, such as:

- **Shortest Path Problems**: For example, the Bellman-Ford algorithm.
- **Knapsack Problem**: Finding the maximum value that can be obtained with a given weight limit.
- **Coin Change Problem**: Finding the minimum number of coins needed to make a certain amount.

### [[String Processing]]

Dynamic programming is essential in string processing tasks, such as:

- **Edit Distance**: Computing the minimum number of operations needed to transform one string into another.
- **Sequence Alignment**: Aligning DNA, RNA, or protein sequences.

### [[Resource Allocation]]

Dynamic programming helps in making decisions about resource allocation in various fields, such as:

- **Inventory Management**: Deciding the optimal stock levels.
- **Project Scheduling**: Allocating resources efficiently over a project timeline.

Understanding dynamic programming and its principles is crucial for solving a wide range of complex problems efficiently.
