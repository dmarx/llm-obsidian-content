consistency patterns


**ASSISTANT**

In the context of distributed systems, **consistency patterns** refer to various techniques and models for managing how and when data is updated and synchronized across multiple nodes or replicas in the system. These patterns strike different balances between **strong** and **weak** consistency, often depending on application needs, network conditions, and performance requirements.

Here are some of the most important consistency patterns:

---

### 1. **Strong Consistency (Linearizability)**

**Definition:** 
Strong consistency, also known as *linearizability*, ensures that after an operation (e.g., a write) completes, any subsequent read operation on any node will return the most recent value. This creates the illusion that operations occur in a **global total order** as if they were processed on a single, centralized node.

- **Formalization:** Let \( W(x, v) \) represent a write of value \( v \) to a data item \( x \). A system is strongly consistent if, for any read \( R(x) \), \( R(x) \) returns the most recent value written by \( W(x, v) \), as long as \( W(x, v) \) has been acknowledged.

**Use cases:**
- Financial applications (e.g., banking systems).
- Strong database transactions requiring **ACID** (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) guarantees.
  
**Trade-offs:** Strong consistency typically comes at the cost of higher **latency** or reduced **availability** in distributed systems due to the need for coordination across nodes, especially under network partitions.

### 2. **Sequential Consistency**

**Definition:**
Sequential consistency relaxes the requirements of strong consistency by ensuring that all operations appear to occur in some global order, but the order doesn't necessarily reflect the real-time occurrence of events. The only requirement is that the operations of each individual process (or client) are executed in the order they were issued, but the interleaving between different processes' operations may vary.

- **Formalization:** If processes \( P_1 \) and \( P_2 \) issue operations \( W_1(x) \), \( R_1(x) \), \( W_2(x) \), and \( R_2(x) \), sequential consistency ensures that all operations are serialized in a way that respects the per-process ordering. That is, \( W_1(x) \) precedes \( R_1(x) \), and \( W_2(x) \) precedes \( R_2(x) \), but there is no guarantee on the order between \( W_1(x) \) and \( W_2(x) \).

**Use cases:**
- Systems that tolerate some out-of-order operations but require a consistent view of data history across all clients.
  
**Trade-offs:** Sequential consistency allows better performance than strong consistency because it relaxes the need for strict global coordination. However, it is still more restrictive than the more relaxed patterns like eventual consistency.

### 3. **Causal Consistency**

**Definition:**
Causal consistency ensures that operations that are causally related are seen by all nodes in the same order, while unrelated operations may be seen in different orders. For example, if a node reads a value written by another node, and then updates the value, that update must be seen by all nodes after the initial write.

- **Formalization:** If operation \( O_1 \) causally precedes operation \( O_2 \) (denoted \( O_1 \rightarrow O_2 \)), then \( O_1 \) must appear before \( O_2 \) in the execution history of all nodes. Causal precedence can be determined by dependencies, such as read-after-write or message passing between processes.

**Use cases:**
- Collaborative editing software (e.g., Google Docs).
- Social networks where updates should respect causal dependencies (e.g., comments and likes on posts).

**Trade-offs:** Causal consistency is more relaxed than sequential and strong consistency, providing more availability and better performance, but maintaining causal relationships between operations can add complexity to the system.

### 4. **Eventual Consistency**

**Definition:**
In an eventually consistent system, all replicas will **eventually** converge to the same value, provided no new updates are made. However, during periods of network partition or delays, reads from different nodes may return different values (i.e., temporary inconsistency is allowed).

- **Formalization:** A system is eventually consistent if, after a time \( t \), for every pair of nodes \( N_i \) and \( N_j \), the values of data item \( x \) stored on \( N_i \) and \( N_j \) converge to the same value, assuming no further writes to \( x \) after \( t \).

**Use cases:**
- High-availability systems like [[DynamoDB]], [[Cassandra]], or other NoSQL databases.
- Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) where stale data is acceptable for short periods.

**Trade-offs:** Eventual consistency provides high availability and low latency, particularly in geographically distributed systems. However, it sacrifices strong guarantees about immediate consistency. Application developers must tolerate scenarios where users see outdated data.

### 5. **Read-Your-Writes Consistency**

**Definition:**
Read-your-writes consistency is a session-level guarantee where a node or client that writes a value to a data item is guaranteed to read that value (or a more recent value) in subsequent reads. This ensures a consistent experience for a single user or client session.

- **Formalization:** Let \( W(x, v) \) be a write by client \( C \). For any subsequent read \( R(x) \) by the same client \( C \), \( R(x) \) will return \( v \) or a value more recent than \( v \).

**Use cases:**
- User sessions in web applications, where it is crucial that users see their own updates immediately.
  
**Trade-offs:** This pattern is relatively lightweight and only guarantees consistency within the context of a single client session. It does not provide guarantees about what other clients see.

### 6. **Monotonic Reads Consistency**

**Definition:**
Monotonic reads consistency ensures that once a client reads a particular value of a data item, it will never see an older version of that data item in subsequent reads. In other words, reads are **monotonically increasing** in terms of the data version.

- **Formalization:** If a client performs read \( R_1(x) \) and receives value \( v_1 \), and then performs another read \( R_2(x) \) after \( R_1(x) \), then \( R_2(x) \) will return either \( v_1 \) or a more recent value \( v_2 \geq v_1 \).

**Use cases:**
- Applications requiring a consistent and increasing view of data history, such as versioned systems.
  
**Trade-offs:** Monotonic reads prevent clients from seeing out-of-order updates, but they don't enforce strong guarantees of real-time data freshness. It balances consistency with performance.

### 7. **Monotonic Writes Consistency**

**Definition:**
Monotonic writes ensure that write operations from a single client are serialized in the order they are issued. This guarantees that if a client issues a sequence of writes \( W_1(x), W_2(x), \ldots, W_n(x) \), they will be applied in that order on all replicas.

- **Formalization:** If \( W_1(x) \) and \( W_2(x) \) are two writes by client \( C \) such that \( W_1(x) \) precedes \( W_2(x) \), all nodes must apply \( W_1(x) \) before \( W_2(x) \).

**Use cases:**
- Systems requiring ordered updates to maintain integrity, such as inventory or transaction systems.

**Trade-offs:** Monotonic writes consistency avoids certain classes of write anomalies but may introduce latency as the system ensures write-order preservation.

---

### Conclusion

Each of these **consistency patterns** offers a different trade-off between availability, latency, and the guarantees of data consistency across distributed systems. The choice of a specific consistency model depends on the application's requirements, the expected workload, and the degree of network reliability. Systems like [[Cassandra]], [[DynamoDB]], and [[Spanner]] employ combinations of these patterns, using more relaxed models for higher availability while offering strong consistency where needed.
