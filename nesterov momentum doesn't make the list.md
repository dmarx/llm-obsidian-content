title: nesterov momentum doesn't make the list

Nesterov Momentum doesn't make the list?


**ASSISTANT**

You are correct; Nesterov's momentum, also known as Nesterov's accelerated gradient (NAG), is indeed one of his most influential contributions and should definitely be highlighted. Let's correct that oversight and include it in the list of significant works by Yurii Nesterov.

### Significant Works of Nesterov (Including Nesterov Momentum)

### 1. **Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient Descent (1983)**
Nesterov introduced an accelerated gradient method that significantly improves the convergence rate of gradient descent for convex optimization problems. The method achieves an optimal convergence rate of $O(1/k^2)$, where $k$ is the iteration number, compared to the $O(1/k)$ rate of standard gradient descent.

### 2. **Nesterov Momentum (Nesterovâ€™s Accelerated Gradient - NAG)**
Nesterov's momentum is an extension of the accelerated gradient method, designed to improve the efficiency of gradient-based optimization algorithms. Unlike standard momentum methods, which use the gradient at the current point to update the velocity, Nesterov's method anticipates the future position by applying the gradient at the "lookahead" point.

The update rules for Nesterov's momentum are as follows:
$$
v_{k+1} = \mu v_k - \alpha \nabla f(x_k + \mu v_k)
$$
$$
x_{k+1} = x_k + v_{k+1}
$$
where $v$ is the velocity, $\mu$ is the momentum parameter, $\alpha$ is the learning rate, and $\nabla f$ is the gradient of the objective function $f$.

### 3. **Introductory Lectures on Convex Optimization: A Basic Course (2004)**
This book provides a comprehensive introduction to the field of convex optimization, covering fundamental theories, algorithms, and applications. It is a highly regarded reference for students and researchers.

### 4. **Primal-Dual Subgradient Methods for Convex Problems (2009)**
In this work, Nesterov developed primal-dual subgradient methods for solving large-scale convex optimization problems. These methods are particularly effective for non-smooth optimization problems.

### 5. **Smooth Minimization of Non-Smooth Functions (2005)**
Nesterov proposed a method for minimizing non-smooth convex functions by smoothing them, making it possible to apply gradient-based methods to problems that were previously intractable with such methods.

#### Key Paper:
- Nesterov, Y. (2005). "Smooth minimization of non-smooth functions." *Mathematical Programming*, 103(1), 127-152.

### 6. **Efficiency of Coordinate Descent Methods on Huge-Scale Optimization Problems (2012)**
Nesterov investigated the efficiency of coordinate descent methods for large-scale optimization problems, demonstrating their potential in handling very large datasets and high-dimensional problems.

#### Key Paper:
- Nesterov, Y. (2012). "Efficiency of coordinate descent methods on huge-scale optimization problems." *SIAM Journal on Optimization*, 22(2), 341-362.

### 7. **Gradient Methods for Minimizing Composite Functions (2013)**
This work presents new gradient methods tailored for minimizing composite functions, which are common in many practical optimization problems, especially in machine learning and signal processing.

#### Key Paper:
- Nesterov, Y. (2013). "Gradient methods for minimizing composite functions." *Mathematical Programming*, 140(1), 125-161.

### 8. **Random Gradient-Free Minimization of Convex Functions (2011)**
Nesterov introduced methods for gradient-free optimization, which are particularly useful in scenarios where gradient information is not readily available or is expensive to compute.

#### Key Paper:
