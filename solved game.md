# Solved Game

A **solved game** is a game for which the optimal strategy and outcome can be determined from any position through complete analysis. The level of solution varies depending on the information available and computational requirements.

## Levels of Solution

### Ultra-Weak Solution

An **[[ultra-weak solution]]** determines the game-theoretic value (win, loss, or draw) from the initial position under perfect play, without necessarily providing the optimal strategy. Formally:

$$v(s_0) \in \{W, L, D\}$$

where $s_0$ is the initial game state.

### Weak Solution

A **[[weak solution]]** provides:
- The game-theoretic value from the initial position
- A strategy that secures this value from the initial position

Mathematically, this requires finding $\sigma^*$ such that:

$$v(s_0, \sigma^*) = \max_{\sigma} \min_{\tau} v(s_0, \sigma, \tau)$$

### Strong Solution

A **[[strong solution]]** determines the optimal strategy and game-theoretic value from any legal position that can arise during play. For position $s$:

$$\forall s \in S_{reachable}: \exists \sigma_s^* \text{ such that } v(s, \sigma_s^*) = v^*(s)$$

where $v^*(s)$ is the minimax value of position $s$.

### Ultra-Strong Solution

An **[[ultra-strong solution]]** provides optimal play from every possible position, including those unreachable through legal play:

$$\forall s \in S: \exists \sigma_s^* \text{ such that } v(s, \sigma_s^*) = v^*(s)$$

## Solution Methods

### Backward Induction

For finite games with perfect information, **[[backward induction]]** solves the game by working from terminal positions:

$$v(s) = \begin{cases}
u(s) & \text{if } s \text{ is terminal} \\
\max_{a \in A(s)} v(\delta(s,a)) & \text{if } player(s) = 1 \\
\min_{a \in A(s)} v(\delta(s,a)) & \text{if } player(s) = 2
\end{cases}$$

where $\delta(s,a)$ is the state transition function.

### Alpha-Beta Pruning

**[[Alpha-beta pruning]]** optimizes minimax search by maintaining bounds:

```
function alphabeta(node, depth, α, β, maximizingPlayer)
    if depth = 0 or node is terminal
        return heuristic_value(node)
    
    if maximizingPlayer
        value := -∞
        for each child of node
            value := max(value, alphabeta(child, depth-1, α, β, FALSE))
            α := max(α, value)
            if value ≥ β
                break  // β cutoff
        return value
    else
        value := +∞
        for each child of node
            value := min(value, alphabeta(child, depth-1, α, β, TRUE))
            β := min(β, value)
            if value ≤ α
                break  // α cutoff
        return value
```

### Retrograde Analysis

**[[Retrograde analysis]]** builds endgame databases by working backwards from terminal positions:

1. Identify all terminal positions with known values
2. For each position $s$ with unknown value:
   - If all successor positions have known values
   - Compute $v(s)$ based on successor values
3. Iterate until all reachable positions are valued

## Complexity Considerations

### State Space Complexity

The **[[state space complexity]]** is the number of legal game positions:

$$|S| = \text{number of distinct legal positions}$$

### Game Tree Complexity

The **[[game tree complexity]]** is the number of leaf nodes in the complete game tree:

$$|T| = \prod_{d=0}^{D-1} b_d$$

where $b_d$ is the branching factor at depth $d$ and $D$ is the maximum depth.

### Computational Complexity

Determining optimal play is:
- **PSPACE-complete** for generalized chess, checkers, and Go
- **EXPTIME-complete** for generalized chess with unbounded pieces
- **[[2-EXPTIME-complete]]** for games with private information

## Examples of Solved Games

### Perfect Information Games

1. **Tic-tac-toe**: Ultra-strongly solved (draw with perfect play)
2. **Connect Four**: Strongly solved (first player wins)
3. **Checkers (8×8)**: Weakly solved (draw with perfect play)
4. **Hex (smaller boards)**: Ultra-weakly solved via strategy stealing

### Imperfect Information Games

1. **Heads-up Limit Texas Hold'em**: Essentially solved using CFR+
2. **Small poker variants**: Solved using linear programming

## Mathematical Framework

### Value Function

The **[[value function]]** for a two-player zero-sum game:

$$v(s) = \max_{\sigma_1 \in \Sigma_1} \min_{\sigma_2 \in \Sigma_2} \mathbb{E}[u(s, \sigma_1, \sigma_2)]$$

For solved games, this value is known exactly.

### Strategy Representation

Optimal strategies can be represented as:
- **[[Policy functions]]**: $\pi: S \rightarrow A$
- **[[Lookup tables]]**: Direct mapping from states to actions
- **[[Decision trees]]**: Hierarchical representation of choices
- **[[Neural networks]]**: Learned approximations of optimal play

## Solution Verification

A claimed solution can be verified by:

1. **[[Consistency checking]]**: Ensuring claimed values satisfy game rules
2. **[[Strategy validation]]**: Confirming strategies achieve claimed values
3. **[[Independent verification]]**: Multiple solvers reaching same conclusion

Formally, for position $s$ and claimed optimal strategy $\sigma^*$:

$$v(s, \sigma^*) \geq v(s, \sigma) \quad \forall \sigma \in \Sigma$$

## Approximate Solutions

For complex games, **[[approximate solutions]]** may be necessary:

- **[[ε-Nash equilibrium]]**: Strategies within ε of optimal
- **[[Monte Carlo methods]]**: Statistical approximations
- **[[Heuristic evaluations]]**: Domain-specific value estimates

The approximation quality is measured by:

$$\epsilon = |v_{approx}(s) - v^*(s)|$$

## Applications

Solved games provide:
- **[[Perfect play benchmarks]]** for AI evaluation
- **[[Theoretical insights]]** into game structure
- **[[Training data]]** for machine learning systems
- **[[Endgame databases]]** for practical play
