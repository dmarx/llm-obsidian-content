**USER**

the right of integrity


**ASSISTANT**

The **right of integrity** is a fundamental aspect of [[moral rights under copyright law]], particularly recognized under the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]]. This right ensures that authors and creators maintain control over how their works are altered, presented, and associated with their reputation and personal honor. Here's an in-depth exploration of the right of integrity, its legal basis, implications, and examples.

## Key Aspects of the Right of Integrity

### Definition

The right of integrity allows authors to object to any distortion, mutilation, modification, or other derogatory actions in relation to their works that would be prejudicial to their honor or reputation. This right is a personal right, distinct from economic rights, and is intended to protect the personal and reputational interests of the creator.

### Legal Basis

#### Berne Convention

- **Article 6bis**: The Berne Convention specifically addresses the right of integrity in Article 6bis. It grants authors the right to object to and seek relief in case of any modification or action that would harm their honor or reputation, even after the transfer of their economic rights.
- **Duration**: The protection of moral rights, including the right of integrity, is typically as long as the copyright in the work, although the specifics can vary by jurisdiction.

#### National Laws

- **France**: French law offers strong protection of moral rights, reflecting the civil law tradition that emphasizes the personal connection between authors and their works.
- **United States**: The Visual Artists Rights Act (VARA) of 1990 provides limited moral rights, including the right of integrity, to creators of visual art.
- **United Kingdom**: UK law, under the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, recognizes moral rights, including the right of integrity, with certain conditions and exceptions.

### Implications

#### Protection Against Alterations

- **Modifications**: Authors can prevent unauthorized modifications, adaptations, or alterations that they consider harmful to their reputation or honor.
- **Context and Presentation**: The right of integrity also covers the context and manner in which a work is presented. For example, an author can object if their work is used in a context that distorts its meaning or misrepresents its purpose.

#### Posthumous Protection

- **Legacy Protection**: The right of integrity often extends beyond the author's lifetime, allowing heirs or estates to protect the author's legacy and reputation from derogatory alterations.

### Examples

#### Visual Arts

- **Defacing or Altering Art**: An artist may invoke the right of integrity to prevent the defacing, cropping, or otherwise altering of their visual artwork in a way that distorts its intended meaning or appearance.

#### Literature

- **Editing Text**: An author can object to unauthorized editing or abridging of their literary work if such changes would distort the original intent or harm their reputation.

#### Music

- **Changing Lyrics or Composition**: Composers and lyricists can prevent unauthorized changes to their musical compositions or lyrics that would alter the work's character or message.

### Case Studies

#### Gilliam v. American Broadcasting Companies, Inc.

- **Background**: This 1976 case involved members of Monty Python who sued ABC for broadcasting heavily edited versions of their TV shows.
- **Outcome**: The court ruled in favor of Monty Python, recognizing that the edits distorted the original content and harmed the creators' reputations, thus violating their moral rights.

#### VARA Cases

- **Visual Artists Rights Act**: In the U.S., VARA has been invoked in several cases, such as *Carter v. Helmsley-Spear, Inc.* (1995), where artists sued to prevent the destruction of their commissioned sculptures in a commercial building. The court upheld their right of integrity, preventing the sculptures' removal and destruction.
