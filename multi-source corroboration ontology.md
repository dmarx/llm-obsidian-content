**USER**

what about the case where multiple studies corroborate the same claim?

# Multi-Source Corroboration Ontology

## Enhanced Evidence Model

### [[Corroboration Strength]]
For claim $c$ and evidence set $E$:
```
Strength(c) = Σ(wᵢ · eᵢ) where:
  wᵢ = f(methodology_rigor, sample_size, reproducibility)
  eᵢ ∈ [-1, 1]
```

### Example: Dropout Effectiveness

```
Claim: "Dropout reduces overfitting in deep networks"

Evidence: {
  RAU₁: {
    source: "Dropout (Hinton et al., 2012)",
    weight: 0.8,
    methodology: "Original empirical study",
    metrics: {ImageNet: "+2% accuracy"}
  },
  
  RAU₂: {
    source: "Theoretical Analysis (Wager et al., 2013)",
    weight: 0.9,
    methodology: "Mathematical proof",
    result: "Equivalent to L2 with data-dependent regularization"
  },
  
  RAU₃: {
    source: "Large-scale Study (He et al., 2015)",
    weight: 0.95,
    methodology: "Systematic ablation",
    metrics: {ImageNet: "+1.8% accuracy"}
  }
}

Confidence = 0.883  // Weighted average
Consensus = 1.0     // All positive evidence
```

### [[Evidence Quality Metrics]]
```
Quality(e) = (
  statistical_power,
  effect_size,
  reproduction_count,
  citation_impact
)
```

This model captures both quantity and quality of corroborating evidence while maintaining provenance and methodological details.
