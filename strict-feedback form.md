### Strict-Feedback Form

The strict-feedback form is a specific structure of nonlinear systems that facilitates the design of controllers using recursive techniques like backstepping. Systems in strict-feedback form are structured in a way that allows the design of virtual controls at each step, leading to the overall stabilization of the system.

### Structure of Strict-Feedback Systems

A system is in strict-feedback form if it can be written as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\dot{x}_1 &= f_1(x_1) + g_1(x_1) x_2, \\
\dot{x}_2 &= f_2(x_1, x_2) + g_2(x_1, x_2) x_3, \\
&\ \vdots \\
\dot{x}_{n-1} &= f_{n-1}(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{n-1}) + g_{n-1}(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{n-1}) x_n, \\
\dot{x}_n &= f_n(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) + g_n(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) u,
\end{aligned}
$$

where \( x = [x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n]^T \) is the state vector, \( u \) is the control input, and the functions \( f_i \) and \( g_i \) are sufficiently smooth.

### Recursive Design Procedure: Backstepping

Backstepping is well-suited for systems in strict-feedback form. The procedure involves the following steps:

#### Step 1: Define the First Lyapunov Function

Start with the first state \( x_1 \) and define a Lyapunov function:

$$
V_1(x_1) = \frac{1}{2} x_1^2.
$$

#### Step 2: Introduce a Virtual Control

Treat the second state \( x_2 \) as a virtual control input for the first subsystem. Define a virtual control law \( \alpha_1(x_1) \) to stabilize the first subsystem:

$$
\alpha_1(x_1) = -k_1 x_1,
$$

where \( k_1 \) is a positive constant.

Define the error for the virtual control:

$$
z_1 = x_2 - \alpha_1(x_1) = x_2 + k_1 x_1.
$$

#### Step 3: Extend the Lyapunov Function

Extend the Lyapunov function to include the error \( z_1 \):

$$
V_2(x_1, z_1) = V_1(x_1) + \frac{1}{2} z_1^2 = \frac{1}{2} x_1^2 + \frac{1}{2} (x_2 + k_1 x_1)^2.
$$

#### Step 4: Recursive Steps for Higher-Order Systems

Continue this process recursively for higher-order states. For each additional state \( x_i \), introduce a new virtual control \( \alpha_{i-1} \), define the error \( z_{i-1} \), and extend the Lyapunov function.

#### Step 5: Design the Actual Control Input

Finally, design the actual control input \( u \) for the last state \( x_n \) to stabilize the entire system.

### Example: Three-State System in Strict-Feedback Form

Consider a three-state system in strict-feedback form:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\dot{x}_1 &= x_2, \\
\dot{x}_2 &= x_3, \\
\dot{x}_3 &= u.
\end{aligned}
$$

**Step 1: First Lyapunov Function**:

Define the first Lyapunov function for \( x_1 \):

$$
V_1(x_1) = \frac{1}{2} x_1^2.
$$

The time derivative of \( V_1 \) is:

$$
\dot{V}_1 = x_1 \dot{x}_1 = x_1 x_2.
$$

To make \( \dot{V}_1 \) negative definite, choose a virtual control \( \alpha_1 \):

$$
\alpha_1(x_1) = -k_1 x_1,
$$

where \( k_1 \) is a positive constant.

Define the tracking error for the virtual control:

$$
z_1 = x_2 - \alpha_1(x_1) = x_2 + k_1 x_1.
$$

**Step 2: Extended Lyapunov Function**:

Extend the Lyapunov function to include the error \( z_1 \):

$$
V_2(x_1, z_1) = V_1(x_1) + \frac{1}{2} z_1^2 = \frac{1}{2} x_1^2 + \frac{1}{2} (x_2 + k_1 x_1)^2.
$$

The time derivative of \( V_2 \) is:

$$
\dot{V}_2 = x_1 \dot{x}_1 + z_1 \dot{z}_1.
$$

Using the system dynamics:

$$
\dot{z}_1 = \dot{x}_2 + k_1 \dot{x}_1 = x_3 + k_1 x_2.
$$

To make \( \dot{V}_2 \) negative definite, choose a virtual control \( \alpha_2 \):

$$
\alpha_2(x_1, x_2) = -k_1 x_2 - k_2 (x_2 + k_1 x_1).
$$

Define the tracking error for the second virtual control:

$$
z_2 = x_3 - \alpha_2(x_1, x_2) = x_3 + k_2 x_2 + k_2 k_1 x_1.
$$

**Step 3: Extended Lyapunov Function**:

Extend the Lyapunov function to include the error \( z_2 \):

$$
V_3(x_1, z_1, z_2) = V_2(x_1, z_1) + \frac{1}{2} z_2^2 = \frac{1}{2} x_1^2 + \frac{1}{2} (x_2 + k_1 x_1)^2 + \frac{1}{2} (x_3 + k_2 x_2 + k_2 k_1 x_1)^2.
$$

The time derivative of \( V_3 \) is:

$$
\dot{V}_3 = x_1 \dot{x}_1 + z_1 \dot{z}_1 + z_2 \dot{z}_2.
$$

Using the system dynamics:

$$
\dot{z}_2 = \dot{x}_3 + k_2 \dot{x}_2 + k_2 k_1 \dot{x}_1 = u + k_2 x_3 + k_2 k_1 x_2.
$$

To stabilize the system, choose the control law \( u \):

$$
u = -k_3 z_2,
$$

where \( k_3 \) is a positive constant. This ensures:

$$
\dot{V}_3 = -k_3 z_2^2,
$$

which is negative definite, indicating stability.

### Conclusion

The strict-feedback form is a useful structure for nonlinear systems that facilitates the application of recursive design methods like backstepping. By treating each state sequentially and introducing virtual controls at each step, the overall system can be stabilized. This approach is particularly powerful for designing controllers for complex nonlinear systems.
