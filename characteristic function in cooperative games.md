Characteristic Function in Cooperative Games

### Characteristic Function in Cooperative Games

The **characteristic function** is a crucial concept in [[cooperative game theory]], encapsulating the value that each coalition of players can achieve through cooperation. This function provides a formal way to describe the potential outcomes of different subsets of players working together.

#### Definition

For a cooperative game $(N, v)$:

- $N$ is the set of players, often denoted as $N = \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$.
- $v: 2^N \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is the characteristic function, where $2^N$ is the power set of $N$ (all possible coalitions).

The characteristic function $v(S)$ assigns a real number to each coalition $S \subseteq N$, representing the total payoff or value that coalition $S$ can guarantee by cooperating, regardless of the actions of players outside $S$.

#### Properties

1. **Normalization**:
   $$ v(\emptyset) = 0. $$
   The empty coalition has a value of zero.

2. **Superadditivity**:
   For any two disjoint coalitions $S$ and $T$:
   $$ v(S \cup T) \geq v(S) + v(T). $$
   This property suggests that the value of two coalitions working together is at least the sum of their individual values, reflecting the potential benefits of cooperation.

3. **Monotonicity**:
   For any two coalitions $S \subseteq T$:
   $$ v(S) \leq v(T). $$
   A larger coalition can achieve at least as much value as any of its sub-coalitions.

#### Example: Simple Characteristic Function

Consider a cooperative game with three players $N = \{1, 2, 3\}$:

- $v(\{1\}) = 0$
- $v(\{2\}) = 0$
- $v(\{3\}) = 0$
- $v(\{1, 2\}) = 100$
- $v(\{1, 3\}) = 100$
- $v(\{2, 3\}) = 100$
- $v(\{1, 2, 3\}) = 120$

This example illustrates the value of different coalitions, showing that any two-player coalition can achieve a value of 100, while the grand coalition achieves 120.

#### Applications

1. **Determining the Core**:
   The core of a cooperative game is derived from the characteristic function. It consists of imputations that ensure no coalition would gain by breaking away from the grand coalition.

2. **Computing the Shapley Value**:
   The Shapley value, a solution concept that fairly distributes the total payoff among players based on their contributions, is calculated using the characteristic function.

3. **Assessing Feasibility of Cooperation**:
   The characteristic function helps in assessing whether certain coalitions are worthwhile and provides a foundation for analyzing the stability and fairness of cooperative arrangements.

### Mathematical Formulation

Let's denote the characteristic function formally. For a set of players $N = \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$, and a coalition $S \subseteq N$, the characteristic function $v: 2^N \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ satisfies:

1. $$ v(\emptyset) = 0 $$
2. For all $S, T \subseteq N$ with $S \cap T = \emptyset$:
   $$ v(S \cup T) \geq v(S) + v(T) $$
3. For all $S \subseteq T \subseteq N$:
   $$ v(S) \leq v(T) $$

#### Example: Weighted Voting Game

Consider a weighted voting game with three players $N = \{1, 2, 3\}$, where the weights are $w_1 = 3$, $w_2 = 2$, and $w_3 = 1$, and the quota is 4:

- $v(\{1\}) = 0$, $v(\{2\}) = 0$, $v(\{3\}) = 0$
- $v(\{1, 2\}) = 1$ (since $w_1 + w_2 = 5 \geq 4$)
- $v(\{1, 3\}) = 1$ (since $w_1 + w_3 = 4 \geq 4$)
- $v(\{2, 3\}) = 0$ (since $w_2 + w_3 = 3 < 4$)
- $v(\{1, 2, 3\}) = 1$ (since $w_1 + w_2 + w_3 = 6 \geq 4$)

This weighted voting game characterizes the value of each coalition in terms of meeting or exceeding the quota required for a winning coalition.
