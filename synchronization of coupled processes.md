title: synchronization of coupled processes

**USER**

synchronization of coupled processes


**ASSISTANT**

Synchronization of coupled processes refers to the phenomenon where interacting systems or processes adjust their behaviors to operate in unison over time. This concept is studied across disciplines, including [[dynamical systems]], [[statistical mechanics]], neuroscience, and network theory, and applies to systems ranging from the synchronization of oscillatory biological rhythms to coupled power grids.

### Mathematical Foundations of Coupled Process Synchronization

Let us formalize this in terms of coupled dynamical systems. Suppose we have \( N \) dynamical systems, where the state of the \( i \)-th system at time \( t \) is represented as \( \mathbf{x}_i(t) \in \mathbb{R}^d \). Each system evolves according to a differential equation, coupled with the states of other systems:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{x}}_i(t) = \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{x}_i(t)) + \epsilon \sum_{j=1}^N A_{ij} \mathbf{H}(\mathbf{x}_j(t), \mathbf{x}_i(t)),
$$

where:
- \( \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{x}) \) describes the intrinsic dynamics of a single uncoupled process.
- \( \epsilon > 0 \) is the coupling strength, controlling the influence of neighboring systems.
- \( A_{ij} \) is an element of the **adjacency matrix** representing the interaction network (e.g., \( A_{ij} = 1 \) if systems \( i \
