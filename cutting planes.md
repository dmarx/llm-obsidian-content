### Cutting Planes

Cutting planes are a method used in integer programming and mixed-integer programming to iteratively refine the feasible region of a linear programming relaxation by adding linear constraints (cuts). These cuts exclude portions of the feasible region that contain no integer solutions, thereby helping to converge to the optimal integer solution more efficiently.

#### Key Concepts

1. **Linear Relaxation**: The original integer programming problem without the integer constraints, solved as a linear programming problem.
2. **Feasible Region**: The set of all possible values of decision variables that satisfy all constraints.
3. **Cut**: An additional linear constraint added to the problem to eliminate non-integer solutions without removing any feasible integer solutions.
4. **Convex Hull**: The smallest convex set that contains all feasible integer solutions.

#### The Cutting Plane Method

The cutting plane method involves solving the linear relaxation of the integer programming problem, identifying non-integer solutions, and adding cuts to eliminate these solutions iteratively until an optimal integer solution is found.

**Steps of the Cutting Plane Method**:

1. **Solve the Linear Relaxation**:
   - Solve the linear programming relaxation of the integer programming problem, ignoring the integer constraints.

2. **Check for Integer Solution**:
   - If the solution to the relaxed problem is integer, it is optimal for the original problem.
   - If the solution is not integer, proceed to add a cut.

3. **Generate a Cut**:
   - Identify a valid cut that excludes the current non-integer solution but does not exclude any feasible integer solutions.
   - Common techniques for generating cuts include Gomory cuts, Chvátal-Gomory cuts, and fractional cuts.

4. **Add the Cut**:
   - Incorporate the cut into the current set of constraints.
   - Solve the updated linear programming problem.

5. **Iterate**:
   - Repeat the process of solving, checking, generating cuts, and adding cuts until an integer solution is found.

#### Types of Cutting Planes

1. **Gomory Cuts**:
   - Derived from the tableau of the linear programming relaxation.
   - For a basic feasible solution \( x \), if \( x_i \) is not an integer, a Gomory cut is added to eliminate the fractional part of \( x_i \).

2. **Chvátal-Gomory Cuts**:
   - Generated by taking a linear combination of the constraints with integer coefficients and rounding up the right-hand side to the nearest integer.

3. **Fractional Cuts**:
   - Target the fractional components of the solution by adding constraints that cut off the current non-integer solution without excluding any integer feasible points.

#### Example Problem

Consider the integer programming problem:

**Objective Function**:
$$
\text{Maximize } Z = 3x_1 + 5x_2
$$

**Constraints**:
$$
x_1 + 7x_2 \leq 28
$$
$$
3x_1 - x_2 \leq 6
$$
$$
x_1, x_2 \geq 0
$$
$$
x_1, x_2 \in \mathbb{Z}
$$

**Step-by-Step Solution using Cutting Planes**:

1. **Solve the Linear Relaxation**:
   - Solve the LP relaxation (ignoring integer constraints):
   \[
   \text{Maximize } Z = 3x_1 + 5x_2
   \]
   \[
   \text{Subject to: }
   \]
   \[
   x_1 + 7x_2 \leq 28
   \]
   \[
   3x_1 - x_2 \leq 6
   \]
   \[
   x_1, x_2 \geq 0
   \]
   - Assume the relaxed solution yields \( x_1 = 4.5 \), \( x_2 = 3 \), with \( Z = 3(4.5) + 5(3) = 27.5 \).

2. **Generate a Gomory Cut**:
   - The current solution \( x_1 = 4.5 \) is not an integer. Generate a Gomory cut to exclude this solution.
   - The Gomory cut derived from the tableau might be:
   \[
   x_1 \leq 4
   \]

3. **Add the Cut and Resolve**:
   - Add the new constraint \( x_1 \leq 4 \) to the problem and resolve the LP relaxation.
   - The new LP problem:
   \[
   \text{Maximize } Z = 3x_1 + 5x_2
   \]
   \[
   \text{Subject to: }
   \]
   \[
   x_1 + 7x_2 \leq 28
   \]
   \[
   3x_1 - x_2 \leq 6
   \]
   \[
   x_1 \leq 4
   \]
   \[
   x_1, x_2 \geq 0
   \]
   - Assume the new solution is \( x_1 = 4 \), \( x_2 = 3 \), with \( Z = 3(4) + 5(3) = 27 \).

4. **Check for Integer Solution**:
   - The solution \( x_1 = 4 \), \( x_2 = 3 \) is integer.
   - Thus, \( x_1 = 4 \), \( x_2 = 3 \) with \( Z = 27 \) is the optimal integer solution.

#### Applications

1. **Manufacturing**: Optimizing production schedules, [[resource allocation]], and supply chain logistics.
2. **Logistics**: Solving vehicle routing problems, [[scheduling]], and distribution planning.
3. **Finance**: Portfolio optimization where investments must be made in whole units.
4. **Telecommunications**: Network design, bandwidth allocation, and routing.
5. **Energy**: Optimal planning and operation of power systems.

#### Advantages and Challenges

**Advantages**:
- Improves the efficiency of branch and bound methods by reducing the search space.
- Can handle large and complex integer programming problems.

**Challenges**:
- Generating effective cuts requires sophisticated algorithms and can be computationally intensive.
- Multiple iterations may be needed, increasing computational effort.

#### Conclusion

Cutting planes are a powerful technique for solving integer and mixed-integer programming problems by iteratively refining the feasible region and eliminating non-integer solutions. By integrating cutting planes with other optimization methods like branch and bound, businesses and organizations can achieve more efficient and accurate solutions to complex decision-making problems. Advanced techniques and heuristics further enhance the applicability and effectiveness of cutting planes in real-world scenarios.
