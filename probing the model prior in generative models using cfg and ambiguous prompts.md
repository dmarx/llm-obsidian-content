### Probing the Model Prior in Generative Models Using CFG and Ambiguous Prompts

When investigating the intrinsic biases and default behaviors of generative models, particularly those involving [[Diffusion Models|diffusion models]] and [[Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)|GANs]], researchers often employ techniques such as Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) with varying scales and short, ambiguous prompts. This approach is designed to reveal the "model prior," which encapsulates what the model has learned to generate in the absence of strong directional input or conditioning.

#### Understanding Model Prior

The "model prior" in the context of generative models refers to the underlying distribution of data that the model tends to generate when not strongly conditioned by external inputs. It is essentially the default setting of the model, showcasing the types of outputs it is inclined to produce based on its training data and inherent architecture.

#### Technique: Low CFG and Ambiguous Prompts

To probe this model prior effectively, researchers often generate outputs using low values of CFG and provide the model with deliberately vague or ambiguous prompts. Hereâ€™s how this technique works and why it is important:

1. **Low CFG Scaling**: By setting the CFG scale parameter (typically denoted as $\gamma$) to a low value, the influence of any explicit conditioning (like text descriptions in text-to-image models or specific attribute controls in other conditional models) is minimized. This low setting allows the model to "freely" generate outputs more reflective of its internal learned patterns rather than responding strongly to the conditioning.

2. **Using Ambiguous Prompts**: Ambiguous prompts are those that do not specify clear or specific attributes, directions, or outcomes (e.g., "a scene" or "an object"). These prompts are intentionally vague to avoid steering the model too strongly in any particular direction, thus allowing the model's default tendencies or biases to surface more clearly.

#### Purpose and Insights

- **Bias Exploration**: This method is particularly useful for exploring biases in the training data of the model. Since the generative process is less guided, the outputs more directly reflect the data distribution the model has internalized.
- **Default Behavior Analysis**: Understanding the default behavior helps in assessing the model's generalization capabilities and its potential limitations or strengths in an unsupervised setting.
- **Model Robustness**: Testing with low CFG and ambiguous prompts can also reveal how robust the model is to vague or minimal input, a scenario common in real-world applications where precise user inputs cannot always be guaranteed.

#### Practical Application

Consider a diffusion model trained to generate images:

- **Set-Up**: The researcher sets $\gamma$ very low (close to zero) and inputs a series of ambiguous prompts like "something interesting."
- **Generation and Analysis**: The model generates a variety of images, which are then analyzed to see what types of themes, objects, or styles predominately appear. This can indicate what the model has "learned" as being interesting or typical based on its training.

#### Challenges

- **Interpretation Complexity**: The interpretation of outputs from such an unguided or minimally guided generative process can be subjective and complex. It often requires careful analysis to differentiate between meaningful default behaviors and random noise.
- **Model Sensitivity**: Different models and architectures might show varying levels of sensitivity to CFG scaling and prompt ambiguity, requiring adjustments and calibrations specific to each model.

Using low CFG and ambiguous prompts to probe the model prior provides valuable insights into the internal workings and biases of generative models, enhancing our understanding of artificial intelligence in creative and generative contexts. This technique is an important tool in the ongoing evaluation and development of more robust and fair generative models.
