# Autotelic Agent

An [[autotelic agent]] is a system that generates and pursues its own goals or objectives intrinsically, rather than being driven purely by external rewards or predetermined purposes. The term derives from the Greek "auto" (self) and "telos" (goal/end).

## Formal Characterization

We can model an autotelic agent A as a tuple:

A = (S, G, V, π, μ)

Where:
- S: The agent's internal state space
- G: The space of possible goals the agent can generate
- V: A value function V: S × G → ℝ that evaluates states relative to current goals
- π: A policy function π: S × G → A mapping states and goals to actions
- μ: A goal generation function μ: S → G that produces new goals based on internal state

## Key Properties

### Goal Generation
The distinguishing feature of autotelic agents is the μ function, which must:
1. Be [[self-referential]] - goals depend on the agent's own state
2. Exhibit [[temporal coherence]] - goals persist long enough to be meaningfully pursued
3. Display [[progressive complexity]] - generated goals build upon previous achievements

### Value Learning
The value function V evolves through interaction with the environment, characterized by:
- [[Intrinsic motivation]] - reward signals derived from internal evaluations rather than external sources
- [[Competence-based progression]] - value estimates that scale with the agent's capabilities
- [[Homeostatic regulation]] - maintaining an optimal level of challenge in goal selection

## Mathematical Framework

The dynamics of an autotelic agent can be expressed through the following system:

1) Goal Generation:
   g_t = μ(s_t)

2) Action Selection:
   a_t = argmax_a ∑_τ γ^τ V(s_{t+τ}, g_t) | π

3) State Update:
   s_{t+1} = f(s_t, a_t)

4) Value Update:
   V'(s_t, g_t) = V(s_t, g_t) + α[r_t + γ max_a V(s_{t+1}, g_t) - V(s_t, g_t)]

Where:
- t denotes time step
- γ is a discount factor
- α is a learning rate
- r_t is an intrinsically generated reward signal

## Relationship to Other Concepts

Autotelic agents are closely related to several key concepts in AI and cognitive science:
- [[Intrinsic Motivation]] in reinforcement learning
- [[Autonomous Mental Development]]
- [[Self-Directed Learning]]
- [[Homeostatic Goals]]

## Open Questions

Several fundamental questions remain in the development of truly autotelic agents:
1. How to design μ functions that generate meaningful and achievable goals
2. How to balance goal persistence with flexibility
3. How to ensure generated goals remain aligned with any base objectives
4. How to prevent degenerate goal selection (e.g., selecting trivially achievable goals)

## Applications

The autotelic framework has potential applications in:
- [[Lifelong Learning]] systems
- [[Artificial General Intelligence]] architectures
- [[Developmental Robotics]]
- [[Meta-Learning]] systems
