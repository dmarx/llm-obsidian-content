Justified True Belief

### Justified True Belief

**Definition:** Justified true belief (JTB) is a traditional concept in epistemology that defines knowledge as consisting of three components: belief, truth, and justification. According to this model, an individual knows a proposition if and only if it is true, the individual believes it, and the belief is justified.

### Components of Justified True Belief

#### Truth

- **Definition:** The proposition must be true for it to be considered knowledge. Truth is typically seen as correspondence to reality; a proposition is true if it accurately describes the state of affairs in the world.
- **Example:** The statement "Water boils at 100°C under standard atmospheric conditions" is true because it corresponds to the observed physical properties of water.

#### Belief

- **Definition:** The individual must believe the proposition. Belief is a psychological state in which an individual holds a proposition to be true.
- **Example:** If a person believes that Paris is the capital of France, they hold the proposition "Paris is the capital of France" to be true.

#### Justification

- **Definition:** The belief must be justified, meaning that the individual has good reasons or evidence for holding the belief. Justification involves having a rational basis for the belief.
- **Example:** A person who believes that the Earth orbits the Sun based on astronomical evidence and scientific understanding has a justified belief.

### The Gettier Problem

#### Introduction

In 1963, philosopher Edmund Gettier published a paper challenging the JTB model by presenting cases where an individual has a belief that is true and justified, yet intuitively does not seem to constitute knowledge. These cases, known as Gettier cases, suggest that JTB is not sufficient for knowledge.

#### Example of a Gettier Case

- **Scenario:** Suppose Smith has strong evidence for the proposition "Jones owns a Ford" (e.g., Jones has always owned a Ford and drove one to work today). Based on this, Smith concludes, "Either Jones owns a Ford, or Brown is in Barcelona," without any knowledge about Brown's whereabouts. Coincidentally, Jones sold his Ford that morning, but by sheer luck, Brown happens to be in Barcelona.
- **Analysis:** Smith's belief "Either Jones owns a Ford, or Brown is in Barcelona" is true, justified, and believed by Smith. However, Smith's justification is unrelated to the truth of the proposition (it was based on Jones owning a Ford), so intuitively, Smith does not "know" the proposition.

### Responses to the Gettier Problem

#### No False Lemmas

One response to the Gettier problem is to add a condition to the JTB model, requiring that the justification for the belief does not depend on any false premises (no false lemmas).

- **Refined Definition:** A person knows a proposition if it is true, they believe it, they are justified in believing it, and their justification does not rely on any false lemmas.
- **Example:** In the Gettier case above, Smith's belief would not count as knowledge because the justification involves the false premise that Jones owns a Ford.

#### Reliabilism

Reliabilism suggests that a belief counts as knowledge if it is produced by a reliable cognitive process.

- **Definition:** A person knows a proposition if it is true, they believe it, and their belief is produced by a reliable process that typically yields true beliefs.
- **Example:** Perceptual beliefs based on normal sensory inputs are often considered reliable, while beliefs based on guessing are not.

#### Causal Theory of Knowledge

The causal theory asserts that knowledge requires a causal connection between the fact and the belief.

- **Definition:** A person knows a proposition if it is true, they believe it, and there is an appropriate causal connection between the fact that makes the proposition true and the person’s belief in it.
- **Example:** Seeing a tree in the yard and believing there is a tree in the yard because the tree caused the visual perception.

### Contemporary Perspectives

Modern epistemologists continue to debate and refine the conditions for knowledge. While the JTB model has been foundational, Gettier cases have shown the need for additional criteria or alternative models to fully capture the nature of knowledge.

#### Examples of Further Refinements

- **Virtue Epistemology:** Focuses on the intellectual virtues of the knower, suggesting that knowledge arises from cognitive character traits like open-mindedness, intellectual courage, and intellectual carefulness.
- **Contextualism:** Proposes that the standards for justification can vary depending on the context, suggesting that what counts as knowledge in one situation might not in another.

### Summary

Justified true belief has been a foundational concept in epistemology for defining knowledge. However, Gettier problems have shown that JTB is not sufficient, leading to the development of alternative theories and refinements, such as no false lemmas, reliabilism, and the [[causal theory of knowledge]]. These ongoing debates and refinements aim to better capture the complexities of knowledge and address the limitations of the traditional JTB model.
