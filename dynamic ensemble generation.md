5: Extending the Ensemble Voting Pattern**

Here are several ways to extend the **Ensemble Voting Pattern**:
1. **Weighted Voting**: Give certain agents more voting power based on their expertise or track record.
2. **Hybrid Voting**: Instead of selecting a single response, combine parts of multiple responses into a final result.
3. **User Involvement**: Allow the user to act as the final voter, reviewing the agent responses and making the final decision.

---

### **Learning Outcomes**:

1. **Collaborative Problem Solving**: Students learn how multiple agents can collaborate by independently generating solutions and then reaching a consensus through voting.
   
2. **Voting Mechanisms**: The assignment introduces students to basic voting mechanisms and shows how they can be applied to multi-agent systems to improve decision-making.
   
3. **Combining Expertise**: Students understand how diverse expertise (e.g., analytical, creative, risk-taking) can be combined to create better solutions through ensemble methods.

4. **Managing Conflicting Outputs**: The **Ensemble Voting Pattern** teaches students how to handle situations where agents produce conflicting results and how to reconcile those conflicts using voting mechanisms.

---

### **Assignment Extension Ideas**:

1. **Agent Confidence Scores**: Extend the voting system by allowing agents to provide a confidence score along with their response. The Voting Manager can weigh responses based on these scores.
   
2. **Voting with Feedback Loops**: Introduce a feedback loop where agents see the results of the voting process and use that information to improve their future responses.
   
3. **Parallel Agent Evaluation**: Implement a system where agents generate solutions in parallel, but the user or a **Moderator Agent** ultimately decides based on the agents' input.

---

### **Summary**:

In this assignment, students implement the **Ensemble Voting Pattern**, where multiple agents independently generate responses to a task, and the system uses a voting mechanism to select the best solution. This pattern encourages collaboration between diverse agents with different expertise, demonstrating how ensemble techniques can lead to better decision-making and improved outcomes in multi-agent systems.

### **Assignment: Dynamic Ensemble Generation Pattern**

In this assignment, students will explore the **Dynamic Ensemble Generation Pattern**, a strategy where multiple agents are dynamically selected or created based on the specific problem at hand. The ensemble of agents is not fixed but is generated on-the-fly to best match the requirements of a given task. This pattern emphasizes flexibility and adaptability, allowing the system to optimize which agents to include in the ensemble based on context.

### **Objective**:
1. Teach students how to implement **Dynamic Ensemble Generation**, where the system selects or creates agents on-the-fly based on the user’s input.
2. Show how to generate agent ensembles dynamically to match specific tasks or challenges, leading to more optimized, context-aware problem-solving.
3. Demonstrate how to enhance flexibility and responsiveness in multi-agent systems by customizing agent participation for each problem.

### **What Is Dynamic Ensemble Generation?**

**Dynamic Ensemble Generation** is a strategy where a multi-agent system **dynamically creates or selects** a group of agents (the **ensemble**) to work on a problem. The ensemble composition can vary based on:
- The **nature of the task**: Different tasks may require different types of agents.
- **User preferences** or **constraints**: The user can specify how to prioritize certain agents or strategies.
- The **current environment** or **context**: The system adapts based on real-time needs (e.g., performance, time constraints).

Instead of using a fixed set of agents, the system **generates an optimal ensemble** for each task, selecting agents that are best suited to contribute.

#### **Key Characteristics**:
- **Dynamic Selection**: Agents are chosen or generated based on the task or problem context.
- **Custom Ensembles**: Each task can result in a different ensemble composition, tailored to the problem.
- **Flexibility**: The system adapts to different user needs, priorities, or problem requirements on-the-fly.

#### **Use Cases**:
- **Personalized Problem Solving**: The system chooses the right set of agents to solve problems based on the user’s preferences (e.g., balancing creativity and accuracy).
- **Complex Task Adaptation**: For tasks that change dynamically (e.g., a project with evolving requirements), the system adapts by adding, removing, or changing agents in real-time.
- **Adaptive Decision-Making**: Dynamic ensembles allow the system to respond to real-time data or user input, optimizing for performance or other constraints.

### **Step 1: Defining a Problem for Dynamic Ensemble Generation**

Let’s define a scenario where the **Dynamic Ensemble Generation** pattern will be useful. Suppose you want to **generate a research proposal** on **renewable energy solutions**, and you have the following possible agents:
1. **Research Agent**: Collects detailed data on renewable energy technologies.
2. **Writing Agent**: Drafts the proposal based on the collected data.
3. **Editor Agent**: Refines the draft to ensure clarity and structure.
4. **Fact-Checker Agent**: Ensures the accuracy of all technical details.
5. **Creative Agent**: Suggests innovative approaches or perspectives for the proposal.

The **Dynamic Ensemble Generator** will select which agents should work on the task based on:
- **User preferences**: Does the user prioritize creativity, technical accuracy, or both?
- **Task complexity**: Does the task require all agents or just a subset?
- **Performance requirements**: Should the system prioritize speed over thoroughness?

---

### **Step 2: Implementing the Agents**

First, we’ll define our **specialized agents** that will participate in the dynamic ensemble. Each agent has a specific role and is used depending on the task's needs.

```python
class Agent:
    def __init__(self, name, system_prompt_template):
        self.name = name
        self.system_prompt_template = system_prompt_template
        self.history = []  # Initialize conversation history
    
    def get_system_prompt(self):
        """
        Render the system prompt based on the agent's name and role.
        """
        template = Template(self.system_prompt_template)
        return template.render(name=self.name)
    
    def query_openai(self, user_input, max_tokens=100, temperature=0.7, top_p=1.0, **kwargs):
        """
        Send the conversation history to OpenAI and maintain the chat log.
        """
        self.history.append({"role": "user", "content": user_input})
        response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
            model="gpt-3.5-turbo",  # Using a chat model that supports roles
            messages=self.history,
            max_tokens=max_tokens,
            temperature=temperature,
            top_p=top_p,
            **kwargs
        )
        assistant_reply = response.choices[0].message["content"]
        self.history.append({"role": "assistant", "content": assistant_reply})
        return assistant_reply
```

#### **Defining the Specialized Agents**:
Each agent has a different role based on its system prompt.

```python
# Define system prompts for the agents
research_prompt = "You are a research assistant. Provide detailed data on renewable energy technologies."
writing_prompt = "You are a writing assistant. Draft a structured research proposal based on the collected data."
editor_prompt = "You are an editor. Review and refine the draft for clarity, structure, and professionalism."
fact_checker_prompt = "You are a fact-checker. Ensure the accuracy of all technical details in the proposal."
creative_prompt = "You are a creative assistant. Suggest innovative and unconventional approaches to renewable energy solutions."

# Create instances of the agents
research_agent = Agent(name="ResearchAgent", system_prompt_template=research_prompt)
writing_agent = Agent(name="WritingAgent", system_prompt_template=writing_prompt)
editor_agent = Agent(name="EditorAgent", system_prompt_template=editor_prompt)
fact_checker_agent = Agent(name="FactCheckerAgent", system_prompt_template=fact_checker_prompt)
creative_agent = Agent(name="CreativeAgent", system_prompt_template=creative_prompt)

# Store agents in a dictionary for easy access
available_agents = {
    "ResearchAgent": research_agent,
    "WritingAgent": writing_agent,
    "EditorAgent": editor_agent,
    "FactCheckerAgent": fact_checker_agent,
    "CreativeAgent": creative_agent
}
```

---

### **Step 3: Implementing the Dynamic Ensemble Generator**

Next, we’ll create the **Dynamic Ensemble Generator** that selects which agents should be part of the ensemble based on the user’s preferences or task requirements.

#### **DynamicEnsembleGenerator Implementation**:

```python
class DynamicEnsembleGenerator:
    def __init__(self, available_agents):
        """
        Initialize the Dynamic Ensemble Generator with the available agents.
        
        Arguments:
        - available_agents: A dictionary mapping agent names to Agent objects.
        """
        self.available_agents = available_agents

    def generate_ensemble(self, user_preferences):
        """
        Dynamically generate an ensemble of agents based on user preferences.
        
        Arguments:
        - user_preferences: A dictionary specifying which agents to prioritize or exclude.
        
        Returns:
        - A list of selected agents to participate in the ensemble.
        """
        ensemble = []
        
        # Always include essential agents like research and writing
        ensemble.append(self.available_agents["ResearchAgent"])
        ensemble.append(self.available_agents["WritingAgent"])
        
        # Conditionally include other agents based on user preferences
        if user_preferences.get("creativity"):
            ensemble.append(self.available_agents["CreativeAgent"])
        if user_preferences.get("accuracy"):
            ensemble.append(self.available_agents["FactCheckerAgent"])
        if user_preferences.get("clarity"):
            ensemble.append(self.available_agents["EditorAgent"])
        
        return ensemble

    def execute_ensemble(self, user_input, ensemble):
        """
        Execute the task using the selected ensemble of agents.
        
        Arguments:
        - user_input: The task or question provided by the user.
        - ensemble: The list of agents selected for this task.
        
        Returns:
        - The final output after all agents in the ensemble have contributed.
        """
        results = {}
        
        for agent in ensemble:
            print(f"Running task with {agent.name}...")
            results[agent.name] = agent.query_openai(user_input)
        
        return results
```

---

### **Step 4: Implementing the CLI for Dynamic Ensemble Generation**

We’ll now create a CLI that allows the user to specify their preferences (e.g., prioritize creativity or accuracy), and the **DynamicEnsembleGenerator** will select the agents accordingly.

```python
def dynamic_ensemble_cli():
    print("Welcome to the Dynamic Ensemble System!\n")
    
    while True:
        # Get user input
        user_input = input("Enter your task or question (type 'exit' to quit): ")
        
        if user_input.lower() == "exit":
            break
        
        # Get user preferences
        creativity = input("Do you want to prioritize creativity? (yes/no): ").strip().lower() == "yes"
        accuracy = input("Do you want to prioritize accuracy? (yes/no): ").strip().lower() == "yes"
        clarity = input("Do you want to prioritize clarity and structure? (yes/no): ").strip().lower() == "yes"
        
        user_preferences = {
            "creativity": creativity,
            "accuracy": accuracy,
            "clarity": clarity
        }
        
        # Step 1: Dynamically generate the ensemble based on user preferences
        ensemble = dynamic_ensemble_generator.generate_ensemble(user_preferences)
        
        # Step 2: Execute the ensemble and get the results
        results = dynamic_ensemble_generator.execute_ensemble(user_input, ensemble)
        
        # Print the results from each agent in the ensemble
        print("\nEnsemble Results:")
        for agent_name, result in results.items():
            print(f"{agent_name}: {result}\n")

# Create an instance of
