**ASSISTANT**

The statement "the total energy of a gas particle is proportional to the square of its velocity components" refers to the **kinetic energy** of a gas particle in classical mechanics. In the context of kinetic theory and the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, this relationship is fundamental for deriving the distribution of velocities of particles in a gas.

### Kinetic Energy and Velocity Components

For a particle with mass $m$ moving in three-dimensional space with velocity $\vec{v} = (v_x, v_y, v_z)$, the **kinetic energy** $E_{\text{kin}}$ is given by the well-known formula from classical mechanics:

$$ E_{\text{kin}} = \frac{1}{2} m \vec{v} \cdot \vec{v} = \frac{1}{2} m (v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2). $$

Here:
- $v_x$, $v_y$, and $v_z$ are the components of the velocity in the $x$, $y$, and $z$ directions, respectively.
- The total velocity magnitude $v$ is related to the components by:
  $$ v = \sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2}. $$

This equation tells us that the **kinetic energy** of the particle depends on the **sum of the squares of its velocity components**.

### Why Energy is Proportional to the Square of Velocity

The kinetic energy depends on the square of the velocity because it arises from the **work-energy principle** in physics. The kinetic energy of an object is a measure of how much work is required to accelerate that object from rest to a given velocity. Mathematically, this relationship comes from integrating the force applied over the distance traveled, leading to the square dependence on velocity.

In other words:
- **Velocity** is a first-order quantity that measures the rate of change of position.
- **Kinetic energy** measures the "cost" in terms of energy to achieve that velocity, and it increases quadratically with velocity because the faster an object is moving, the more energy it takes to increase its speed further.

### Connection to Maxwell's Distribution

In the derivation of the **Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution**, this quadratic dependence of energy on velocity is crucial. The distribution is a **probability density function** that describes the likelihood of a particle having a particular velocity $v$ in a gas.

Maxwell's key assumption was that in thermal equilibrium, the probability of a particle having a particular energy $E_{\text{kin}}$ follows the **Boltzmann distribution**:
$$ P(E_{\text{kin}}) \propto \exp\left(-\frac{E_{\text{kin}}}{k_B T}\right), $$
where:
- $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant,
- $T$ is the absolute temperature,
- $E_{\text{kin}} = \frac{1}{2} m v^2$ is the kinetic energy of the particle.

Since the kinetic energy is proportional to $v^2$, this probability distribution implies that **higher velocities (and hence higher energies) are less probable**, which is why the velocity distribution has an exponential dependence on the square of velocity. Substituting $E_{\text{kin}} = \frac{1}{2} m v^2$ into the Boltzmann factor yields:

$$ P(v) \propto \exp\left(-\frac{m v^2}{2 k_B T}\right). $$

This is the foundation of the **Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution**, which describes how the velocities of gas particles are distributed at a given temperature.

### Summary of the Role of Kinetic Energy in Maxwell's Distribution

1. **Kinetic energy depends on the square of velocity**: $E_{\text{kin}} = \frac{1}{2} m v^2$.
2. **The probability of a particle having a certain energy** follows the Boltzmann distribution: $P(E_{\text{kin}}) \propto \exp\left(-E_{\text{kin}} / k_B T\right)$.
3. Since $E_{\text{kin}}$ is proportional to $v^2$, the **probability distribution for velocities** takes the form:
   $$ P(v) \propto \exp\left(-\frac{m v^2}{2 k_B T}\right). $$

Thus, the quadratic dependence of energy on velocity components plays a crucial role in shaping the form of the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution and in describing the thermal motion of particles in gases.
