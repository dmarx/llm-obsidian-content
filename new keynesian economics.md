New Keynesian economics


**ASSISTANT**

New Keynesian economics is a school of thought in macroeconomics that builds on the principles of Keynesian economics, incorporating microeconomic foundations to explain price and wage rigidities and their implications for economic fluctuations and policy. It emerged in response to criticisms of traditional Keynesian models and aims to provide a more rigorous theoretical framework that can be used for empirical analysis and policy design.

### Core Concepts

1. **Price and Wage Rigidities**:
   New Keynesian models emphasize the presence of nominal rigidities, particularly sticky prices and wages, which prevent immediate adjustments to changes in economic conditions. This results in short-run non-neutralities of money, meaning that monetary policy can have real effects on output and employment.

2. **Microfoundations**:
   New Keynesian economics provides microeconomic underpinnings for macroeconomic phenomena. It uses optimization behavior of individual agents (households and firms) to derive aggregate relationships. This approach contrasts with traditional Keynesian models, which often relied on ad hoc assumptions.

3. **Menu Costs and Calvo Pricing**:
   A key innovation in New Keynesian models is the introduction of [[menu costs]] and Calvo pricing. Menu costs refer to the costs associated with changing prices, which can lead firms to adjust prices infrequently. Calvo pricing posits that in any given period, only a fraction of firms can adjust their prices, leading to staggered price setting.

4. **Imperfect Competition**:
   New Keynesian models typically assume [[imperfect competition]] in product and labor markets. Firms and workers have some degree of price-setting power, which allows for the existence of markups over marginal cost and wage stickiness.

5. **Monetary and Fiscal Policy**:
   These models place significant emphasis on the role of monetary and fiscal policy in stabilizing the economy. They support the use of systematic monetary policy rules, like the Taylor Rule, and counter-cyclical fiscal policies to mitigate the effects of economic shocks.

### Mathematical Formalism

Consider a basic New Keynesian model with sticky prices and wages:

- **Household Optimization**:
  Households maximize expected lifetime utility:
  $$ 
  \max \mathbb{E}_t \left[ \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \beta^t U(C_t, L_t) \right] 
  $$
  subject to the intertemporal budget constraint:
  $$ 
  P_t C_t + B_{t+1} \leq W_t L_t + (1 + r_t) B_t + \Pi_t 
  $$
  where $C_t$ is consumption, $L_t` is labor, $P_t$ is the price level, $B_t$ are bonds, $W_t` is the wage rate, $r_t$ is the interest rate, $\Pi_t$ are firm profits, and $\beta$ is the discount factor.

- **Firm Optimization and Calvo Pricing**:
  Firms maximize profits by setting prices subject to Calvo pricing:
  $$ 
  P_t(i) = \begin{cases} 
  \bar{P}_t & \text{with probability } (1-\theta) \\
  P_{t-1}(i) & \text{with probability } \theta 
  \end{cases}
  $$
  where $\theta$ is the fraction of firms that cannot adjust their prices in a given period. The optimal reset price $\bar{P}_t$ is chosen to maximize the expected present value of future profits.

- **New Keynesian Phillips Curve**:
  The aggregate supply side is characterized by the New Keynesian Phillips Curve, which relates inflation $\pi_t$ to expected future inflation $\mathbb{E}_t[\pi_{t+1}]$ and the output gap $y_t - y^*$:
  $$ 
  \pi_t = \beta \mathbb{E}_t[\pi_{t+1}] + \kappa (y_t - y^*)
  $$
  where $\kappa$ is a parameter that captures the degree of price stickiness and $y^*$ is the potential output.

- **Monetary Policy Rule**:
  The central bank sets the nominal interest rate according to a rule like the Taylor Rule:
  $$ 
  r_t = r^* + \phi_{\pi} (\pi_t - \pi^*) + \phi_y (y_t - y^*)
  $$
  where $r^*$ is the natural rate of interest, $\pi_t$ is the inflation rate, $\pi^*$ is the target inflation rate, $y_t$ is the output, $y^*$ is the potential output, and $\phi_{\pi}$ and $\phi_y$ are policy response coefficients.

### Implications and Applications

New Keynesian economics provides a robust framework for analyzing monetary and fiscal policy. It explains why economies can experience persistent unemployment and output gaps, even in the presence of rational expectations. The [[New Keynesian Phillips Curve|NKPC]] is central to understanding [[inflation dynamics]] and the trade-offs faced by policymakers.

The framework has been widely used for policy analysis, particularly in the context of the [[Great Recession]] and the subsequent recovery. It supports the view that active monetary and fiscal policies are necessary to stabilize the economy and mitigate the effects of adverse shocks.

By integrating microeconomic foundations with Keynesian insights, New Keynesian economics offers a coherent and empirically relevant approach to macroeconomic analysis, making it a cornerstone of modern macroeconomic theory and policy design.
