Empirical Bayes (EB) methods are a blend of frequentist and Bayesian approaches. They aim to estimate the prior distribution from the data rather than assuming it a priori, thus "learning" the prior empirically. This approach is particularly useful in hierarchical models where we have multiple similar datasets or parameters that are thought to share some common characteristics.

## Definition and Framework

### Hierarchical Model

Consider a hierarchical model with parameters $\theta_i$ for $i = 1, 2, \ldots, n$, where each $\theta_i$ is assumed to be drawn from a common prior distribution governed by hyperparameters $\phi$. The data $x_i$ are then observed, conditional on the $\theta_i$:

$$
\theta_i \sim \pi(\theta \mid \phi) \\
x_i \mid \theta_i \sim f(x \mid \theta_i)
$$

In a full Bayesian analysis, we would specify a prior for $\phi$, combine it with the likelihood of the observed data, and compute the posterior distribution for $\phi$. However, in Empirical Bayes, we estimate $\phi$ directly from the data, often using maximum likelihood or moment matching.

### Steps in Empirical Bayes

1. **Estimate Hyperparameters**: Use the observed data $x_i$ to estimate the hyperparameters $\phi$. This is typically done by maximizing the marginal likelihood of the data:
   $$
   \hat{\phi} = \arg \max_\phi \prod_{i=1}^n \int f(x_i \mid \theta) \pi(\theta \mid \phi) \, d\theta
   $$
2. **Construct Empirical Prior**: Use the estimated hyperparameters $\hat{\phi}$ to construct an empirical prior $\pi(\theta \mid \hat{\phi})$.
3. **Perform Bayesian Inference**: With the empirical prior, perform Bayesian inference as usual to obtain the posterior distribution of $\theta_i$ given $x_i$:
   $$
   \pi(\theta_i \mid x_i, \hat{\phi}) \propto f(x_i \mid \theta_i) \pi(\theta_i \mid \hat{\phi})
   $$

## Examples of Empirical Bayes

### Normal-Normal Model

Consider a scenario where we have multiple groups, each with its own mean $\theta_i$, and we assume these means are normally distributed:

$$
\theta_i \sim N(\mu, \tau^2) \\
x_i \mid \theta_i \sim N(\theta_i, \sigma^2)
$$

Here, $\mu$ and $\tau^2$ are the hyperparameters. The marginal distribution of $x_i$ is:

$$
x_i \sim N(\mu, \tau^2 + \sigma^2)
$$

To estimate $\mu$ and $\tau^2$, we maximize the marginal likelihood:

$$
\hat{\mu}, \hat{\tau^2} = \arg \max_{\mu, \tau^2} \prod_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi(\tau^2 + \sigma^2)}} \exp\left( -\frac{(x_i - \mu)^2}{2(\tau^2 + \sigma^2)} \right)
$$

Once $\hat{\mu}$ and $\hat{\tau^2}$ are obtained, the empirical prior is:

$$
\pi(\theta_i \mid \hat{\mu}, \hat{\tau^2}) = N(\hat{\mu}, \hat{\tau^2})
$$

The posterior distribution of $\theta_i$ given $x_i$ is then:

$$
\theta_i \mid x_i, \hat{\mu}, \hat{\tau^2} \sim N\left( \frac{\frac{\hat{\tau^2}}{\sigma^2} x_i + \hat{\mu}}{\frac{\hat{\tau^2}}{\sigma^2} + 1}, \frac{\hat{\tau^2} \sigma^2}{\hat{\tau^2} + \sigma^2} \right)
$$

### Poisson-Gamma Model

Consider a scenario where we observe counts $x_i$ for different groups, assumed to follow Poisson distributions with unknown rates $\lambda_i$:

$$
\lambda_i \sim \text{Gamma}(\alpha, \beta) \\
x_i \mid \lambda_i \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda_i)
$$

The marginal distribution of $x_i$ is a negative binomial distribution. The hyperparameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are estimated by maximizing the marginal likelihood of the observed counts:

$$
\hat{\alpha}, \hat{\beta} = \arg \max_{\alpha, \beta} \prod_{i=1}^n \frac{\Gamma(x_i + \alpha)}{x_i! \Gamma(\alpha)} \left( \frac{\beta}{\beta + 1} \right)^\alpha \left( \frac{1}{\beta + 1} \right)^{x_i}
$$

With these estimates, the empirical prior for $\lambda_i$ is:

$$
\pi(\lambda_i \mid \hat{\alpha}, \hat{\beta}) = \text{Gamma}(\hat{\alpha}, \hat{\beta})
$$

The posterior distribution of $\lambda_i$ given $x_i$ is:

$$
\lambda_i \mid x_i, \hat{\alpha}, \hat{\beta} \sim \text{Gamma}(\hat{\alpha} + x_i, \hat{\beta} + 1)
$$

## Benefits and Limitations

### Benefits
- **Data-Driven**: Empirical Bayes methods use the data to inform the prior, making them flexible and often more accurate than using a purely subjective prior.
- **Computational Efficiency**: By estimating the prior from the data, Empirical Bayes can simplify computations, especially in hierarchical models.
- **Objective Prior**: Empirical Bayes provides a more objective approach to specifying the prior, reducing the potential bias from subjective choices.

### Limitations
- **Dependence on Data**: The prior is estimated from the data, which can sometimes lead to overfitting or circular reasoning.
- **Asymptotic Justification**: The validity of Empirical Bayes methods often relies on large sample sizes for the asymptotic properties to hold.
- **Inflexibility**: The method assumes that the estimated prior accurately represents the true prior, which may not always be the case.

## Conclusion

Empirical Bayes methods offer a powerful compromise between fully Bayesian and frequentist approaches. By estimating the prior from the data, they provide a practical and often effective way to handle hierarchical models and other complex Bayesian inference problems. However, the approach has its limitations, and careful consideration is required to ensure the validity and robustness of the resulting inferences.
