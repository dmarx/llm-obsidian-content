Dual of a graph


**ASSISTANT**

The concept of the **dual of a graph** is a fundamental idea in graph theory, particularly in the context of planar graphs. The dual of a graph depends heavily on its embedding in a plane, suggesting that the relationship between a graph and its dual is rooted in their geometric representations.

### Definition of Dual Graph

For a given planar graph $G$, the dual graph $G^*$ is constructed by placing a vertex in each face of $G$ (including the outer face), and drawing an edge between two vertices in $G^*$ for every edge in $G$ that is shared by the two corresponding faces in $G$. Thus, each edge in the original graph corresponds to exactly one edge in the dual graph, crossing it at a right angle if drawn geometrically.

### Formal Construction

Given a planar graph $G = (V, E)$ embedded in the plane, the dual graph $G^* = (V^*, E^*)$ is constructed as follows:

1. **Vertices of $G^*$**: Each vertex in $G^*$ corresponds to a face in $G$. Therefore, if $G$ has $f$ faces, then $V^*$ will have $f$ vertices.

2. **Edges of $G^*$**: For every edge in $G$ that is an edge of two faces $f_1$ and $f_2$, there is an edge in $G^*$ connecting the vertices corresponding to $f_1$ and $f_2$. If an edge in $G$ is on the boundary of the same face (as can happen with a loop), the corresponding edge in $G^*$ will loop back on the vertex corresponding to that face.

3. **Incidence Relations**: If an edge $e$ in $G$ separates two different faces, $f_1$ and $f_2$, then the corresponding edge $e^*$ in $G^*$ will connect the vertices $v^*_1$ and $v^*_2$ representing $f_1$ and $f_2$, respectively.

### Properties of Dual Graphs

- **Planarity**: If $G$ is planar, then $G^*$ is also planar.
- **Biconnectivity**: If $G$ is connected, then $G^*$ will be connected. Moreover, if $G$ is biconnected (i.e., removing any one vertex does not disconnect the graph), the dual graph $G^*$ will also be biconnected.
- **Face-Vertex Correspondence**: There is a face-vertex correspondence between $G$ and $G^*$ in the sense that the roles of vertices and faces are interchanged.
- **Repeated Dualization**: Dualizing a graph twice, i.e., taking the dual of the dual $(G^*)^*$, generally gives a graph isomorphic to the original graph $G$, especially if we consider graphs embedded in the sphere.

### Examples and Applications

In the realm of [[Topology]] and [[Geometric Graph Theory]], dual graphs play a significant role. For instance, in problems like network design, the concept of dual graphs is used to find complementary properties, such as flows and cuts, via the [[Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem]], where the cut-set of a network and its flows can be studied through its dual.

Moreover, in polygonal mesh used in computer graphics and finite element methods, the dual of a graph helps in defining relationships between elements (like polygons) that share common edges, which is crucial for mesh refinement and optimization techniques.

In summary, the dual graph is a powerful concept in planar graph theory, providing deep insights not only in mathematics but also in various practical applications where geometrical and topological properties of graphs are essential.
