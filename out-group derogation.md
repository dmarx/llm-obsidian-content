Out-Group Derogation


**ASSISTANT**

[[Out-Group Derogation]] is a psychological phenomenon closely associated with [[Worldview Defense]] in the context of [[Terror Management Theory|Terror Management Theory (TMT)]]. It refers to the tendency to devalue, criticize, or show hostility toward individuals or groups that are perceived as different from or in opposition to one's own cultural, ethnic, religious, or ideological group (the in-group). This behavior is particularly pronounced when people are reminded of their mortality, a state known as [[Mortality Salience]].

### Mechanisms of Out-Group Derogation

The mechanisms driving out-group derogation are rooted in the need to protect and reinforce one's cultural worldview in the face of existential threats. When people are reminded of their mortality, they experience a heightened need for psychological security. This security is often derived from a sense of belonging to a group that shares common beliefs and values. Out-group derogation serves as a defense mechanism by:

1. **Reaffirming the Superiority of the In-Group:**
   - By devaluing out-groups, individuals bolster the perceived superiority of their own group, which in turn strengthens their belief that their cultural worldview is the correct and legitimate one. This superiority helps to protect against the anxiety that arises from the awareness of death.

2. **Reducing Cognitive Dissonance:**
   - Encountering people who hold different worldviews can create cognitive dissonance, a psychological discomfort caused by holding conflicting thoughts or beliefs. Out-group derogation helps to resolve this dissonance by dismissing or discrediting the out-group's beliefs as inferior or wrong.

3. **Enhancing In-Group Cohesion:**
   - Hostility toward out-groups can enhance solidarity within the in-group. By uniting against a common "other," members of the in-group may feel a stronger connection to each other and to their shared beliefs, which provides a sense of security and belonging.

### Empirical Evidence

Numerous studies have demonstrated the effect of [[mortality salience]] on out-group derogation. Some key findings include:

- **Increased Prejudice:** When reminded of their mortality, individuals tend to exhibit stronger prejudice against those who belong to different racial, ethnic, or religious groups. For example, in one study, participants who were asked to think about their own death showed increased negative evaluations of people from a different cultural background.

- **Negative Stereotyping:** Mortality salience has been shown to intensify the use of negative stereotypes against out-groups. For instance, research has found that after being reminded of their mortality, participants were more likely to apply negative stereotypes to people from opposing political parties or different religious affiliations.

- **Support for Aggressive Policies:** Mortality salience can lead to greater support for aggressive or punitive policies directed at out-groups. Studies have shown that reminders of death can increase support for military action against foreign nations or for harsh penalties against criminal offenders who are perceived as belonging to an out-group.

### Psychological and Social Implications

Out-group derogation has significant implications both for individuals and for society at large:

- **Intergroup Conflict:** Out-group derogation can exacerbate tensions between different social, ethnic, or religious groups, leading to increased intergroup conflict. In extreme cases, it can contribute to the escalation of violence and even genocide.

- **Polarization:** In political contexts, out-group derogation can fuel polarization, making it more difficult for opposing groups to find common ground or engage in constructive dialogue. This polarization can hinder efforts to address shared challenges, such as public health crises or environmental issues.

- **Discrimination:** On a societal level, out-group derogation can manifest as discrimination in various forms, including racism, xenophobia, and religious intolerance. This discrimination can have lasting negative effects on social cohesion and the well-being of marginalized groups.

### Mitigating Out-Group Derogation

Given the potential harm of out-group derogation, researchers and policymakers have explored ways to mitigate its effects. Some strategies include:

- **Promoting Common Humanity:** Emphasizing shared human experiences and values across groups can reduce the perceived differences between in-groups and out-groups, thereby decreasing derogation. Educational programs that focus on cross-cultural understanding and empathy have been shown to reduce prejudice.

- **Encouraging Self-Affirmation:** Self-affirmation techniques, which involve reflecting on one's core values and positive aspects of the self, have been found to buffer against the effects of [[mortality salience]]. When individuals feel secure in their self-worth, they may be less likely to engage in out-group derogation.

- **Increasing Intergroup Contact:** Facilitating positive interactions between members of different groups can reduce stereotypes and prejudice. The **contact hypothesis** suggests that under certain conditions, intergroup contact can lead to more positive attitudes and reduce the likelihood of out-group derogation.

### Conclusion

[[Out-Group Derogation]] is a powerful defensive response that occurs when individuals are confronted with the reality of their mortality. It serves to protect and reinforce one's cultural worldview but can have harmful consequences for intergroup relations and social harmony. Understanding the mechanisms behind out-group derogation is crucial for addressing and mitigating its negative impacts, particularly in increasingly diverse and interconnected societies.
