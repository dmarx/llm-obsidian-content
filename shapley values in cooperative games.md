### Shapley Values in Cooperative Games

The **Shapley value** is a solution concept in [[cooperative game theory]] that provides a fair allocation of the total payoff to the players based on their contributions to the coalitions. Developed by Lloyd Shapley, it ensures that each player is rewarded according to their marginal contributions across all possible coalitions.

#### Definition

For a cooperative game $(N, v)$ where $N = \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ is the set of players and $v: 2^N \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is the characteristic function, the Shapley value $\phi_i(v)$ for player $i$ is given by:

$$
\phi_i(v) = \sum_{S \subseteq N \setminus \{i\}} \frac{|S|!(|N| - |S| - 1)!}{|N|!} \left( v(S \cup \{i\}) - v(S) \right)
$$

where $|S|$ is the number of players in coalition $S$.

This formula calculates the average marginal contribution of player $i$ across all possible orderings of players.

#### Properties

The Shapley value satisfies several important properties:

1. **Efficiency**:
   $$ \sum_{i \in N} \phi_i(v) = v(N). $$
   The total value is fully distributed among the players.

2. **Symmetry**:
   If $v(S \cup \{i\}) = v(S \cup \{j\})$ for all $S \subseteq N \setminus \{i, j\}$, then $\phi_i(v) = \phi_j(v)$.
   Players who contribute equally receive equal payoffs.

3. **Dummy Player**:
   If $v(S \cup \{i\}) = v(S)$ for all $S \subseteq N \setminus \{i\}$, then $\phi_i(v) = 0$.
   A player who adds no value to any coalition receives a payoff of zero.

4. **Additivity**:
   For two games $(N, v)$ and $(N, w)$, the Shapley value of the sum of the games is the sum of the Shapley values of the individual games:
   $$ \phi_i(v + w) = \phi_i(v) + \phi_i(w). $$

#### Example

Consider a cooperative game with three players $N = \{1, 2, 3\}$ and the characteristic function defined as follows:
$$
\begin{align*}
v(\{1\}) & = 0, \\
v(\{2\}) & = 0, \\
v(\{3\}) & = 0, \\
v(\{1, 2\}) & = 100, \\
v(\{1, 3\}) & = 100, \\
v(\{2, 3\}) & = 100, \\
v(\{1, 2, 3\}) & = 120.
\end{align*}
$$

To compute the Shapley value for each player, we evaluate the marginal contributions:

1. **Player 1**:
   $$ \phi_1(v) = \frac{1}{3!} \left( \sum_{S \subseteq \{2, 3\}} (v(S \cup \{1\}) - v(S)) \right) = \frac{1}{6} \left[ (v(\{1\}) - v(\emptyset)) + (v(\{1, 2\}) - v(\{2\})) + (v(\{1, 3\}) - v(\{3\})) + (v(\{1, 2, 3\}) - v(\{2, 3\})) \right] $$
   Substituting the values:
   $$ \phi_1(v) = \frac{1}{6} \left[ (0 - 0) + (100 - 0) + (100 - 0) + (120 - 100) \right] = \frac{1}{6} \times 220 = \frac{220}{6} = \frac{110}{3} \approx 36.67 $$

2. **Player 2**:
   $$ \phi_2(v) = \frac{1}{3!} \left( \sum_{S \subseteq \{1, 3\}} (v(S \cup \{2\}) - v(S)) \right) = \frac{1}{6} \left[ (v(\{2\}) - v(\emptyset)) + (v(\{1, 2\}) - v(\{1\})) + (v(\{2, 3\}) - v(\{3\})) + (v(\{1, 2, 3\}) - v(\{1, 3\})) \right] $$
   Substituting the values:
   $$ \phi_2(v) = \frac{1}{6} \left[ (0 - 0) + (100 - 0) + (100 - 0) + (120 - 100) \right] = \frac{1}{6} \times 220 = \frac{220}{6} = \frac{110}{3} \approx 36.67 $$

3. **Player 3**:
   $$ \phi_3(v) = \frac{1}{3!} \left( \sum_{S \subseteq \{1, 2\}} (v(S \cup \{3\}) - v(S)) \right) = \frac{1}{6} \left[ (v(\{3\}) - v(\emptyset)) + (v(\{1, 3\}) - v(\{1\})) + (v(\{2, 3\}) - v(\{2\})) + (v(\{1, 2, 3\}) - v(\{1, 2\})) \right] $$
   Substituting the values:
   $$ \phi_3(v) = \frac{1}{6} \left[ (0 - 0) + (100 - 0) + (100 - 0) + (120 - 100) \right] = \frac{1}{6} \times 220 = \frac{220}{6} = \frac{110}{3} \approx 36.67 $$

The Shapley values for all players are approximately $\phi_1(v) = \phi_2(v) = \phi_3(v) = 36.67$.

#### Practical Computation

The computation of Shapley values can become complex for larger games, as it requires evaluating the marginal contributions across all possible coalitions. However, there are algorithms and software tools that can efficiently compute Shapley values for practical applications.

### Applications

1. **Cost Allocation**:
   In joint projects or shared services, the Shapley value helps in determining a fair cost distribution among participants based on their contributions.

2. **Voting Power**:
   In political or corporate voting systems, the Shapley value can measure the influence or power of each voter.

3. **Resource Allocation**:
   In collaborative environments, such as research consortia or joint ventures, the Shapley value provides a fair way to allocate resources and rewards.
