On a Confusion about a Function of Consciousness


**ASSISTANT**

Ned Block's paper *"On a Confusion about a Function of Consciousness"* (1995) is a key text in the philosophy of mind, particularly in the study of consciousness. In this work, Block introduces the distinction between *access consciousness* (A-consciousness) and *phenomenal consciousness* (P-consciousness), and argues that conflating these two aspects of consciousness leads to significant confusion in both philosophical and cognitive science discussions.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the key points of the paper:

### Background: The Functionalist View of Consciousness
Before Block’s paper, many philosophers and cognitive scientists focused primarily on the *functional* aspects of consciousness—how conscious states contribute to information processing, reasoning, and behavior. A common view, especially in the cognitive sciences, was that consciousness is functionally tied to a system's ability to:
- Report on its mental states,
- Make decisions based on conscious contents,
- Integrate information for reasoning and behavior.

This perspective closely aligns with *access consciousness*, but Block argues that this functionalist view overlooks an essential aspect of consciousness—its *phenomenal* quality.

### The Central Distinction: Access Consciousness vs. Phenomenal Consciousness
Block proposes that consciousness is not a monolithic concept and that there are at least two distinct aspects to it:

1. **Access Consciousness (A-consciousness)**:
   - This refers to the way mental content is made available to a system for use in reasoning, decision-making, and behavior control. 
   - A mental state is *A-conscious* if it is accessible for report, inference, and action. 
   - Cognitive access plays a central role: an A-conscious state is one that the subject can act on or report.

   Mathematically, access consciousness involves a functional relationship where a mental state \( M \) is processed by cognitive mechanisms \( C \), leading to actions or decisions:
   $$ M \xrightarrow{C} \text{Report/Behavior} $$
   For example, seeing a red light and being able to say "I see red" or stop at the traffic light involves *A-consciousness*.

2. **Phenomenal Consciousness (P-consciousness)**:
   - This refers to the subjective, qualitative aspects of experience—the "what it is like" character of mental states, or what philosophers call *qualia*.
   - A mental state is *P-conscious* if there is something it is like to be in that state. 
   - P-consciousness does not necessarily require the mental state to be functionally accessible for reasoning or reporting. It is about the experience itself, regardless of whether you can act on it or describe it.

   For example, the *raw sensation* of seeing red, even if you couldn’t report it or use the information, is an instance of phenomenal consciousness.

### The Confusion: Merging A-consciousness with P-consciousness
Block argues that many theories of consciousness mistakenly conflate these two distinct aspects, leading to a "confusion" about the role and function of consciousness. The confusion stems from the assumption that phenomenal consciousness (P-consciousness) just *is* access consciousness (A-consciousness), or that the two are inherently tied together. Block’s paper aims to show that these are distinct phenomena and should be treated as such.

#### Examples Highlighting the Distinction
- **Blindsight**: In blindsight, a patient with damage to the visual cortex is unable to consciously see objects in part of their visual field. However, they can still make accurate guesses about objects in that area when prompted. Block uses this example to illustrate that while these patients lack *phenomenal consciousness* of objects in the blind spot (i.e., they do not experience "what it is like" to see the objects), they have a form of *access consciousness* since the information can be used to guide behavior.
  
- **Subliminal Perception**: Subliminal stimuli are those that affect a person’s behavior without reaching the level of conscious awareness. Block uses subliminal perception to show that certain information may be *A-conscious* (it can influence decisions or behavior) without being *P-conscious* (there is no corresponding subjective experience).

- **Split-Brain Patients**: In split-brain experiments, patients with severed corpus callosum (the connection between the brain's hemispheres) can sometimes demonstrate conflicting behaviors based on the information presented to one hemisphere. Block argues that such cases can further demonstrate dissociations between A-consciousness and P-consciousness.

### Theoretical Implications of the Distinction
Block’s distinction has far-reaching implications for theories of consciousness:
- **Cognitive Science and AI**: Much of cognitive science and artificial intelligence focuses on access consciousness, as it is functional, reportable, and tied to cognitive control. However, P-consciousness, which is tied to subjective experience, raises the "hard problem" of consciousness, as famously defined by [[David Chalmers]]: why and how do physical processes in the brain give rise to subjective experiences?

- **Functionalism**: Block challenges functionalist theories of consciousness by showing that phenomenal consciousness cannot be fully explained in terms of cognitive or functional roles. While access consciousness can be understood in functionalist terms, phenomenal consciousness requires an explanation of why subjective experiences arise from certain brain states, something purely functional descriptions cannot easily capture.

### The "Hard Problem" vs. "Easy Problem"
Block aligns his distinction with [[Chalmers]]'s famous division between the "easy" and "hard" problems of consciousness:
- **Easy Problem**: Explaining the functional mechanisms of consciousness (i.e., explaining access consciousness). This involves identifying the neural and cognitive processes that underlie the ability to access, report, and reason about mental states.
- **Hard Problem**: Explaining why these processes are accompanied by phenomenal consciousness, or subjective experience.

Block argues that functional and cognitive approaches to consciousness may solve the "easy problem" but do not address the "hard problem."

### Criticisms and Responses
Block’s distinction has been influential, but it has also faced criticism. Some, like [[Daniel Dennett]], argue that the distinction between A-consciousness and P-consciousness is misguided or unnecessary. Dennett believes that what we call "phenomenal" consciousness is really just a form of access consciousness we cannot yet explain fully. He accuses Block of endorsing a form of *qualia mysticism* by suggesting that phenomenal properties are beyond functional explanation.

### Conclusion: The Importance of the Distinction
Block's central message is that conflating access consciousness and phenomenal consciousness obscures important philosophical and empirical questions. While access consciousness can be tied to functional, cognitive, and reportable processes, phenomenal consciousness addresses the more fundamental issue of *what it is like* to have experiences. The two aspects, while often overlapping, need to be understood as distinct if we are to make progress in understanding the nature of consciousness.
