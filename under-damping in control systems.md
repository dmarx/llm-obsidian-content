### Under-Damping in Control Systems

Under-damping occurs in control systems when the damping ratio (\(\zeta\)) is less than one (\(0 < \zeta < 1\)). This condition leads to oscillatory responses that gradually settle to the desired setpoint. Understanding under-damping is essential for designing and tuning controllers to achieve the desired balance between responsiveness and stability.

#### 1. **System Response Characteristics**

Under-damped systems exhibit specific transient response characteristics:

- **Oscillations**: The system output oscillates around the setpoint before settling.
- **Overshoot**: The output exceeds the setpoint initially.
- **Settling Time**: The time required for the output to remain within a certain percentage (commonly 2% or 5%) of the setpoint.
- **Peak Time**: The time taken for the output to reach its first peak (maximum value).

For a second-order system described by the transfer function:

$$
G(s) = \frac{\omega_n^2}{s^2 + 2\zeta\omega_n s + \omega_n^2},
$$

where:
- \(\omega_n\) is the natural frequency.
- \(\zeta\) is the damping ratio.

#### 2. **Mathematical Analysis**

The characteristic equation of a second-order system is given by:

$$
s^2 + 2\zeta\omega_n s + \omega_n^2 = 0.
$$

The roots of this equation (the system poles) are:

$$
s = -\zeta\omega_n \pm j\omega_n\sqrt{1 - \zeta^2}.
$$

For an under-damped system (\(0 < \zeta < 1\)), the roots are complex conjugates with negative real parts, leading to oscillatory behavior.

#### 3. **Transient Response Metrics**

##### A. Overshoot (\(M_p\))

Overshoot is the amount by which the output exceeds the setpoint:

$$
M_p = e^{-\frac{\pi\zeta}{\sqrt{1 - \zeta^2}}} \times 100\%.
$$

##### B. Settling Time (\(T_s\))

Settling time is the time required for the output to stay within a certain percentage of the setpoint (commonly 2%):

$$
T_s \approx \frac{4}{\zeta\omega_n}.
$$

##### C. Peak Time (\(T_p\))

Peak time is the time taken to reach the first peak:

$$
T_p = \frac{\pi}{\omega_n\sqrt{1 - \zeta^2}}.
$$

##### D. Damped Natural Frequency (\(\omega_d\))

The frequency of the oscillations in an under-damped system:

$$
\omega_d = \omega_n\sqrt{1 - \zeta^2}.
$$

#### 4. **Examples and Simulations**

##### Example 1: Simple RLC Circuit

Consider a series RLC circuit with the following parameters:
- Resistance (\(R\)) = 10 \(\Omega\)
- Inductance (\(L\)) = 1 H
- Capacitance (\(C\)) = 0.01 F

The damping ratio and natural frequency are given by:

$$
\zeta = \frac{R}{2} \sqrt{\frac{C}{L}}, \quad \omega_n = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}.
$$

Substituting the values:

$$
\zeta = \frac{10}{2} \sqrt{\frac{0.01}{1}} = 0.5, \quad \omega_n = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 \cdot 0.01}} = 10 \, \text{rad/s}.
$$

Since \( \zeta < 1 \), the system is under-damped. The transient response will show oscillations with an overshoot and a settling time determined by the above formulas.

##### Example 2: PID-Controlled System

Consider a second-order system with the transfer function:

$$
G(s) = \frac{1}{s^2 + 2\zeta\omega_n s + \omega_n^2}.
$$

Let \( \omega_n = 5 \, \text{rad/s} \) and \( \zeta = 0.3 \). The system is under-damped. Using a PID controller with initial parameters:

- \( K_p = 1 \)
- \( K_i = 0.1 \)
- \( K_d = 0.05 \)

Simulate the step response using MATLAB or a similar tool to observe the under-damped behavior. Adjust the PID parameters to reduce overshoot and settling time while maintaining stability.

#### 5. **Design Considerations**

When designing controllers for under-damped systems, consider the following:

##### A. PID Tuning

- **Proportional Gain (\(K_p\))**: Increasing \(K_p\) reduces rise time but can increase overshoot.
- **Integral Gain (\(K_i\))**: Helps eliminate steady-state error but can lead to increased overshoot and oscillations.
- **Derivative Gain (\(K_d\))**: Increases damping, reducing overshoot and improving stability.

##### B. Lead-Lag Compensation

Design compensators to modify the system's frequency response:
- **Lead Compensator**: Adds phase lead, increasing damping and reducing overshoot.
- **Lag Compensator**: Improves steady-state performance without significantly affecting transient response.

##### C. State-Space Design

Use state-space methods to place poles in desired locations, ensuring adequate damping and transient response characteristics.

### Conclusion

Under-damping in control systems leads to oscillatory responses characterized by overshoot and a longer settling time. Understanding the dynamics of under-damped systems is crucial for designing effective controllers. By employing techniques such as PID tuning, lead-lag compensation, and state-space design, engineers can improve system performance, balancing responsiveness and stability to achieve desired control objectives in various industrial and process applications.
