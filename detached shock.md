### Detached Shock

A **detached shock** is a type of shock wave that forms in front of a blunt object moving at supersonic or hypersonic speeds through a fluid, such as air. Unlike attached shock waves, which directly meet the surface of the object (like those that form on sharp-nosed bodies), a detached shock wave stands off from the surface of the object, creating a region of subsonic or low-supersonic flow between the shock and the object.

### Characteristics of Detached Shocks

1. **Standoff Distance**:
   - The distance between the object and the detached shock wave is known as the **standoff distance**. This distance depends on the shape of the object, the Mach number of the incoming flow, and the fluid properties.

2. **Bow Shock Formation**:
   - Detached shocks typically form a **bow shock** around the front of the object. The shock is strongest and most detached directly in front of the object and becomes weaker and more oblique as it moves around the sides of the object.

3. **Subsonic Region**:
   - The flow immediately behind the detached shock is often subsonic, even if the flow ahead of the shock is supersonic or hypersonic. This subsonic region allows for smooth deceleration of the flow as it approaches the object's surface.

4. **High Pressure and Temperature**:
   - The region between the detached shock and the object experiences a significant increase in pressure and temperature due to the shock, which can lead to intense aerodynamic heating. This is a critical consideration in the design of high-speed vehicles like re-entry capsules and hypersonic aircraft.

### Formation of Detached Shocks

**Detached shocks** generally occur when the object is blunt or when the flow conditions (such as the Mach number) do not allow the formation of an attached shock. There are several key factors in their formation:

1. **Blunt Objects**:
   - When a blunt object (e.g., a sphere, cylinder, or blunt-nosed re-entry vehicle) moves at supersonic speeds, the flow cannot turn sharply enough to remain attached to the surface. This inability to form an attached shock causes the shock wave to detach and move ahead of the object.

2. **High Mach Number**:
   - At very high Mach numbers, even sharp-nosed bodies can develop detached shocks if the shock angle exceeds a critical value, which cannot be sustained as an attached shock.

3. **Critical Mach Number**:
   - For a given object, there is a critical Mach number below which the shock wave is attached and above which the shock detaches from the surface.

### Analytical and Numerical Analysis

1. **Shock-Polar Diagrams**:
   - Shock-polar diagrams can be used to analyze the conditions under which a detached shock forms. These diagrams plot the possible shock angles for a given Mach number and flow deflection angle.

2. **Numerical Simulations**:
   - Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is commonly used to simulate detached shocks, especially for complex geometries and high-speed flows. These simulations can provide detailed insights into the shock structure, standoff distance, and flow properties in the shock's [[wake]].

3. **Standoff Distance Calculation**:
   - The standoff distance \( \Delta \) can be estimated using empirical correlations or derived from numerical simulations. For a blunt body, it generally scales with the body radius \( R \) and depends on the Mach number \( M \) of the incoming flow:
     $$
     \Delta \sim R \cdot f(M),
     $$
     where \( f(M) \) is a function of the Mach number that increases as \( M \) increases.

### Applications and Implications

**Detached shocks** are critically important in the design and analysis of high-speed aerospace vehicles and re-entry capsules:

1. **Re-Entry Vehicles**:
   - Vehicles like the Apollo command module, the Space Shuttle, and modern re-entry capsules experience detached bow shocks during atmospheric re-entry. The standoff distance of the shock is crucial for determining the heat flux to the vehicle's surface, which informs the design of thermal protection systems.

2. **Hypersonic Aircraft**:
   - Hypersonic vehicles, such as scramjets and spaceplanes, encounter detached shocks at the leading edges and inlets. Understanding the formation and behavior of these shocks is key to optimizing aerodynamic performance and managing thermal loads.

3. **Wind Tunnel Testing**:
   - In supersonic and hypersonic wind tunnel experiments, the behavior of detached shocks is studied to validate CFD models and improve understanding of shock-boundary layer interactions, shock reflection, and shock detachment criteria.

4. **Explosive Detonations**:
   - Detached shocks also occur in the context of explosions, where a spherical shock wave can form around a detonation point. The properties of the shock wave are essential for understanding blast effects and the impact on structures.

### Conclusion

A **detached shock** is a critical phenomenon in [[compressible fluid dynamics]], particularly in the context of supersonic and hypersonic flows around blunt objects. The shock wave forms a bow shape in front of the object, creating a subsonic region between the shock and the object's surface. Understanding detached shocks is crucial for the design and analysis of high-speed aerospace vehicles, as they significantly affect aerodynamic forces, heat transfer, and overall vehicle performance. Numerical simulations and empirical methods are commonly used to study and predict the behavior of detached shocks in various applications.
