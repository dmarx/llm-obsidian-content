Hawk-Dove Game

### Hawk-Dove Game

The Hawk-Dove game is a classic model in [[evolutionary game theory]] that describes the conflict between aggressive and non-aggressive behaviors. It is used to study the evolution of social behaviors and strategies in animals, particularly in the context of resource competition.

#### Basic Setup

1. **Strategies**:
   - **Hawk (H)**: Aggressive behavior, always fights for the resource.
   - **Dove (D)**: Non-aggressive behavior, avoids conflict and shares or retreats.

2. **Payoffs**:
   - $V$: Value of the resource.
   - $C$: Cost of fighting (only incurred if two Hawks meet).

The payoff matrix is structured as follows:

|           | Hawk (H)        | Dove (D)    |
|-----------|------------------|-------------|
| **Hawk**  | $(V - C)/2$      | $V$         |
| **Dove**  | $0$              | $V/2$       |

#### Explanation of Payoffs

- When two Hawks encounter each other, they fight for the resource. The winner gains the resource value $V$, but both incur the cost $C$ of fighting. The expected payoff for each Hawk is $(V - C)/2$.
- When a Hawk encounters a Dove, the Hawk wins the resource without a fight, receiving the full value $V$, while the Dove gets nothing.
- When two Doves meet, they share the resource without conflict, each receiving $V/2$.

#### Population Dynamics

Let $x$ be the frequency of Hawks in the population and $1 - x$ be the frequency of Doves. The average payoffs for Hawks ($\pi_H$) and Doves ($\pi_D$) can be computed based on the population frequencies and the payoff matrix.

1. **Payoff for Hawks**:
   $$
   \pi_H = x \left( \frac{V - C}{2} \right) + (1 - x) V
   $$

2. **Payoff for Doves**:
   $$
   \pi_D = x \cdot 0 + (1 - x) \left( \frac{V}{2} \right)
   $$

The average population payoff ($\bar{\pi}$) is:
$$
\bar{\pi} = x \pi_H + (1 - x) \pi_D
$$

The replicator equation, which describes the change in the frequency of Hawks, is:
$$
\frac{dx}{dt} = x (\pi_H - \bar{\pi})
$$

#### Evolutionary Stability

To find the Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS), we analyze the conditions under which a strategy cannot be invaded by a small number of individuals using an alternative strategy.

1. **Condition for ESS**:
   A strategy $s^*$ is an ESS if:
   - $\pi(s^*, s^*) > \pi(s, s^*)$, or
   - $\pi(s^*, s^*) = \pi(s, s^*)$ and $\pi(s^*, s) > \pi(s, s)$.

For the Hawk-Dove game:
- Pure Hawk or Dove strategies may not be stable because the payoff for Hawks decreases with more Hawks (due to the cost of fighting), and Doves can be exploited by Hawks.
- A mixed strategy equilibrium can be found by setting the payoffs of Hawks and Doves equal.

#### Mixed Strategy Equilibrium

To find the mixed strategy equilibrium where both strategies coexist, set $\pi_H = \pi_D$:

$$
x \left( \frac{V - C}{2} \right) + (1 - x) V = (1 - x) \left( \frac{V}{2} \right)
$$

Solving for $x$:

$$
x \frac{V - C}{2} + V - Vx = \frac{V}{2} - \frac{V}{2} x
$$

$$
x \frac{V - C}{2} + V - Vx = \frac{V}{2} - \frac{V}{2} x
$$

Combine like terms and simplify:

$$
V - Vx = \frac{V}{2} - \frac{V}{2} x + \frac{C}{2} x
$$

$$
V = \frac{V}{2} + \frac{C}{2} x + Vx - \frac{V}{2} x
$$

$$
V = \frac{V}{2} + \frac{C}{2} x + \frac{V}{2} x
$$

Multiply through by 2 to clear the denominator:

$$
2V = V + Cx + Vx
$$

$$
2V - V = Cx + Vx
$$

$$
V = (C + V)x
$$

$$
x = \frac{V}{C + V}
$$

The equilibrium frequency of Hawks ($x^*$) is:

$$
x^* = \frac{V}{C + V}
$$

The equilibrium frequency of Doves is:

$$
1 - x^* = \frac{C}{C + V}
$$

#### Interpretation

- The mixed strategy equilibrium shows that the proportion of Hawks in the population depends on the ratio of the value of the resource to the cost of fighting.
- If the cost of fighting $C$ is much greater than the value $V$, the population will have more Doves.
- If the value $V$ is much greater than the cost $C$, the population will have more Hawks.

### Applications and Examples

1. **Animal Behavior**:
   - Territorial animals may display Hawk-like behavior when the resource value (territory) is high, but may avoid fights (Dove-like behavior) when the cost of fighting (injury) is high.

2. **Human Conflict**:
   - The Hawk-Dove game can model human conflicts where aggressive and non-aggressive strategies are in competition, such as in business or politics.

3. **Resource Management**:
   - Understanding the balance between aggressive and cooperative strategies can inform policies for managing common resources to avoid overexploitation and conflict.
