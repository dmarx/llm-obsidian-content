and choose the appropriate crossing method—whether **[[bounding overwatch]]**, **successive bounding**, or **rushing**—to minimize exposure while maintaining combat effectiveness. The use of overwatch, good communication, and security procedures ensures that units can safely cross danger areas in even the most hostile environments.

establishing security


**ASSISTANT**

**Establishing security** is a crucial step in military operations, ensuring that a unit is protected from potential threats and able to maintain situational awareness after halting movement, crossing a danger area, reaching an objective, or following an engagement. Security must be quickly established to prevent enemy forces from exploiting any vulnerabilities while the unit is stationary.

The goal of establishing security is to **protect the unit**, **observe the surrounding area for threats**, and **maintain readiness** to respond to enemy activity. Security measures include organizing personnel, positioning weapons, and maintaining communication and observation across all sectors.

### Key Principles of Establishing Security

1. **360-Degree Coverage**
   - A fundamental principle of establishing security is ensuring **all-around defense**. The unit positions personnel to cover all potential directions of enemy approach, forming a defensive perimeter.
   - **Sectors of fire** are assigned to each soldier or team, ensuring that the entire area around the unit is covered with overlapping fields of fire.

2. **Observation and Communication**
   - Security is not just about defense but also about **observation**. Soldiers must remain alert, constantly scanning their sectors for any potential threats. Effective **communication** between teams ensures that all sectors are being monitored and that any detected threat is reported immediately.
   - Use of **binoculars, night-vision devices**, or **thermal imaging** enhances the unit’s ability to detect threats in difficult terrain or poor visibility.

3. **Weapons Positioning**
   - Heavy weapons such as **machine guns**, **automatic grenade launchers**, or **anti-tank systems** should be positioned to cover likely avenues of enemy approach, choke points, or high-threat areas.
   - **Snipers** or designated marksmen should take elevated or concealed positions to provide overwatch and long-range coverage.

4. **Defense in Depth**
   - When possible, the unit establishes **defense in depth**, meaning there are multiple layers of defense. This could involve secondary positions to fall back to, redundant fields of fire, and reserves ready to reinforce key sectors if necessary.

5. **Balance Between Security and Mobility**
   - Security should be established in a way that allows for rapid **maneuver** if the unit needs to react to enemy contact or continue its mission. This means positioning troops where they can quickly move to new positions or respond to emerging threats.

6. **Security Maintenance**
   - Security must be **continuous**. While the unit is conducting other tasks (e.g., resupplying, treating casualties, resting), security is never compromised. Certain teams or individuals remain on alert at all times to maintain situational awareness.

### Situations Requiring the Establishment of Security

#### 1. **After Crossing a Danger Area**
Once a unit crosses a danger area (such as a road, river, or open field), security must be immediately established on the far side. This ensures that the unit is not vulnerable to a follow-up attack or ambush while regrouping.

- **Action**: Soldiers take up positions that provide cover and concealment, scanning for enemy forces that might attack from the front, rear, or flanks. Weapons are oriented to cover potential threat avenues.

#### 2. **Halting During Patrols or Movement**
When a patrol or convoy halts for any reason, security must be established before engaging in any other activity (e.g., planning, resting, or resupplying). This is critical to prevent being surprised by enemy forces.

- **Action**: The unit spreads out into a defensive formation, with designated sectors of fire for each individual. In urban areas, security may include watching rooftops, alleyways, and windows. In open terrain, focus is on covering key terrain features that could hide enemy movement.

#### 3. **Defensive Operations**
When a unit establishes a position for defensive purposes (e.g., protecting an objective or holding ground), security is set up more thoroughly and may involve building fortifications, using **barriers**, and setting up **observation posts** (OPs).

- **Action**: Sectors of fire are assigned, heavy weapons are placed to cover likely approaches, and personnel are placed in hardened or concealed positions. Patrols may also be sent out to monitor enemy activity near the perimeter.

#### 4. **Rally Points and Patrol Bases**
Rally points and patrol bases are locations where units halt temporarily to rest, resupply, and plan further movements. Security at these points is critical, as these locations are vulnerable when the unit is stationary for an extended period.

- **Action**: The unit establishes a **360-degree perimeter** and sends out security patrols to monitor the surrounding area. Teams are rotated so that some personnel rest while others remain alert.

#### 5. **After Enemy Contact**
After engaging with enemy forces, security must be reestablished to prevent counterattacks or enemy reinforcements from exploiting the unit's position. This is especially critical after an ambush or firefight, where the unit may be disorganized or spread out.

- **Action**: The unit reorganizes, forms a defensive perimeter, and scans for potential follow-up attacks. Special attention is given to likely avenues of enemy counterattack, such as flanking maneuvers.

### Techniques for Establishing Security

#### 1. **Security Halt (Short Halt)**
A **security halt** is a brief stop where the unit establishes quick, temporary security, typically for a few minutes. The goal is to maintain situational awareness while resting, communicating, or preparing for further movement.

- **Steps**:
  - The unit spreads out in a **circular formation** or forms a **wedge**, with each soldier covering a specific sector.
  - Soldiers take advantage of natural or artificial cover, staying low and scanning their assigned sectors.
  - The halt is usually brief, so personnel remain alert, minimizing distractions like eating or resting.

- **Use**: During patrols, convoy stops, or before entering a danger area.

#### 2. **Establishing a Perimeter**
A **perimeter defense** is set up when the unit needs to secure an area for an extended period. This could be in preparation for a sustained defense, or as part of a **patrol base** or **temporary outpost**.

- **Steps**:
  - The unit spreads out in a **360-degree formation**, ensuring that all possible approaches are covered.
  - **Sectors of fire** are assigned to each individual or team. Overlapping sectors ensure no blind spots.
  - Heavy weapons are positioned to cover the most likely avenues of approach, while **snipers** or **scouts** may be sent to observe potential enemy movement from distance.
  - **Observation posts (OPs)** may be established on elevated terrain or in concealed positions to detect enemy forces early.
  
- **Use**: After reaching an objective, setting up a patrol base, or establishing defensive positions.

#### 3. **Staggered Formation**
In a **staggered formation**, the unit positions personnel in a zig-zag or alternating pattern along a road or path, with soldiers on opposite sides providing mutual cover. This is typically used when moving along roads or trails and allows for quick engagement if attacked.

- **Steps**:
  - Soldiers take up positions on either side of a path or road, staying close enough to maintain communication but far enough apart to avoid being easily targeted by a single attack.
  - Each soldier monitors their sector, with alternating personnel covering opposite sides of the road or trail.

- **Use**: Used during movement, especially when security must be maintained while traveling along linear danger areas such as roads or paths.

#### 4. **Listening and Observation Posts (LP/OP)**
**Listening posts (LPs)** and **observation posts (OPs)** are small detachments sent out from the main unit to monitor enemy activity. They are typically set up on the perimeter of the defensive position, often at night or in low-visibility conditions.

- **Steps**:
  - A small team is sent to a concealed position some distance away from the main unit. This position provides a clear view of likely enemy approaches.
  - The team monitors for enemy movement, radioing back any suspicious activity.
  - OPs may use binoculars or other optical aids to scan for distant threats.

- **Use**: Established in both defensive positions and patrol bases to provide early warning of enemy activity.

#### 5. **Hasty Defense**
A **hasty defense** is a quickly established defensive position in response to unexpected enemy contact. After engaging the enemy, the unit rapidly organizes into defensive positions to repel further attacks.

- **Steps**:
  - Soldiers take cover in the nearest available positions, using natural terrain or whatever is available.
  - Machine guns and other crew-served weapons are set up quickly to provide suppressive fire.
  - The unit forms a basic perimeter while maintaining communication with adjacent elements.

- **Use**: Following a firefight or ambush when there is little time to prepare a formal defensive position.

### Common Security Formations

1. **Linear Security**
   - Used when a unit is protecting a road, trail, or riverbank. Personnel are spread along the length of the feature, focusing their attention outward to protect from attacks from either side.
   - **Best for**: Road patrols, convoy halts, or defending long, narrow features.

2. **360-Degree Perimeter**
   - A circular or near-circular formation providing **all-around defense**. This is the most common formation for security, especially in areas with no clear direction of enemy contact.
   - **Best for**: Patrol bases, danger area crossings, and defense of small units in open areas.

3. **Strongpoint Defense**
   - Establishing a **fortified position** around key terrain features or buildings, typically used in urban environments or fortified positions in the countryside. Security elements cover all entry points, and heavy weapons are positioned to cover avenues
