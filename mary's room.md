### Mary's Room

**Definition:** Mary's Room is a philosophical thought experiment developed by philosopher Frank Jackson in 1982. It is designed to challenge physicalist theories of the mind by highlighting the distinction between physical knowledge and subjective experience. The experiment focuses on a scientist named Mary, who knows everything about the physical aspects of color vision but has never experienced color herself.

### The Thought Experiment

#### Setup

- **Mary's Knowledge:** Mary is a brilliant scientist who has spent her entire life in a black-and-white room, learning everything there is to know about the science of color vision. She understands the physical properties of light, the biology of the eye, and the neural processes involved in color perception.
- **The Black-and-White Room:** Mary has never seen colors directly because she lives in a monochromatic environment and has access only to black-and-white media.

#### The Key Moment

- **Experiencing Color:** One day, Mary is released from the black-and-white room and sees a red apple for the first time. This moment is crucial because she gains a new type of knowledge—what it is like to experience the color red.

### Philosophical Implications

#### The Knowledge Argument

The thought experiment supports the **knowledge argument** against physicalism. Physicalism is the view that all facts about the mind can be explained by physical facts about the brain and the world. The knowledge argument posits that there are certain kinds of knowledge—specifically, knowledge of subjective experiences (qualia)—that cannot be fully captured by physical explanations.

- **New Knowledge:** When Mary sees the color red for the first time, she learns something new—what it is like to experience redness. This suggests that her prior knowledge of the physical facts was incomplete.
- **Qualia:** The new knowledge that Mary gains is about the qualia associated with seeing red. Qualia are the subjective, qualitative aspects of experiences, which seem to be irreducible to physical descriptions.

#### The Explanatory Gap

Mary's Room highlights the **[[explanatory gap]]** between physical processes and subjective experience. This gap refers to the difficulty of explaining how physical processes in the brain give rise to the subjective quality of experiences.

- **Subjective Experience:** Even if Mary knows all the physical facts about color vision, she still lacks the subjective experience of seeing color. This implies that physical descriptions alone cannot fully explain consciousness.

#### Challenges to Physicalism

The thought experiment poses significant challenges to physicalist theories of the mind, suggesting that:

- **Incompleteness of Physicalism:** Physicalist accounts of the mind may be incomplete because they do not account for the subjective aspects of experience.
- **Dualism:** Some philosophers interpret Mary's Room as supporting some form of dualism—the view that the mind and body are fundamentally different kinds of substances or properties.

### Responses to Mary's Room

#### Physicalist Responses

Physicalists have proposed several responses to the challenge posed by Mary's Room:

1. **Ability Hypothesis:** Some physicalists argue that what Mary gains upon seeing color is not new [[propositional knowledge]] (knowledge-that) but a new ability (knowledge-how). According to this view, Mary gains the ability to recognize and remember colors and to imagine them, but she does not learn new facts.
   
2. **Acquaintance Hypothesis:** Another response is that Mary gains acquaintance knowledge—direct experiential knowledge—without learning any new factual information. This means she becomes acquainted with the experience of seeing red but does not gain new [[propositional knowledge]].

#### Criticisms and Support

- **Support for the Knowledge Argument:** Proponents of the knowledge argument maintain that Mary's new experience demonstrates the existence of non-physical facts about the mind.
- **Criticisms of the Knowledge Argument:** Critics argue that the knowledge argument conflates different types of knowledge and that all relevant knowledge can ultimately be explained in physical terms.

### Summary

Mary's Room remains a pivotal thought experiment in the philosophy of mind, challenging our understanding of the relationship between physical processes and subjective experiences. It raises important questions about the completeness of physicalist theories and the nature of consciousness, continuing to inspire debate and research in both philosophy and cognitive science.
