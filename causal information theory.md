# Causal Information Theory

[[Causal Information Theory]] extends classical information theory to account for causal relationships and interventional data, providing a framework for quantifying directed information flow in [[complex systems]].

## Mathematical Foundation

### Causal Channels

A causal channel is defined by:

$p(y|do(x)) \neq p(y|x)$

where:
- $do(x)$ represents Pearl's do-operator
- $p(y|do(x))$ is the interventional distribution
- $p(y|x)$ is the observational distribution

### Directed Information

The [[directed information]] from process $X$ to process $Y$ is:

$I(X \to Y) = \sum_{t=1}^n I(X^t;Y_t|Y^{t-1})$

where:
- $X^t = (X_1,...,X_t)$
- $Y^{t-1} = (Y_1,...,Y_{t-1})$

## Causal Entropy Measures

### Interventional Entropy

The [[interventional entropy]] is defined as:

$H_{do}(Y|X) = -\sum_{x,y} p(x)p(y|do(x))\log p(y|do(x))$

### Causal Impact Measure

The [[causal impact]] of $X$ on $Y$:

$CI(X \to Y) = D_{KL}(p(y|do(x))||p(y))$

where $D_{KL}$ is the Kullback-Leibler divergence.

## Transfer Entropy Extensions

### Causal Transfer Entropy

The [[causal transfer entropy]] incorporates interventions:

$T_{Y \to X}^{causal} = \sum p(x_{t+1}, x_t^{(k)}, y_t^{(l)}) \log \frac{p(x_{t+1}|do(x_t^{(k)}, y_t^{(l)}))}{p(x_{t+1}|do(x_t^{(k)}))}$

## Properties

### Causation-Information Relationship

The [[causation-information inequality]]:

$I(X \to Y) \leq I(X;Y)$

with equality if and only if there is no confounding.

### Causal Markov Condition

For a [[causal graph]] $G$:

$I(X_i; ND(X_i)|PA(X_i)) = 0$

where:
- $PA(X_i)$ are parents of $X_i$
- $ND(X_i)$ are non-descendants of $X_i$

## Applications

1. [[Causal Discovery]]
2. [[Network Inference]]
3. [[Time Series Analysis]]
4. [[Control Theory]]

### Causal Feature Selection

The [[causal feature importance]] measure:

$CFS(X_i) = I(Y;X_i|do(PA(X_i)))$

## Computational Methods

### Estimation Techniques

1. [[Interventional Sampling]]
2. [[Instrumental Variables]]
3. [[Propensity Scoring]]
4. [[Double Machine Learning]]

### Error Analysis

Sources of uncertainty:
1. [[Finite Sample Effects]]
2. [[Confounding Bias]]
3. [[Selection Bias]]
4. [[Measurement Error]]

## Research Directions

1. [[Non-linear Causal Effects]]
2. [[Time-varying Causation]]
3. [[Quantum Causal Information]]
4. [[Causal Machine Learning]]

The field continues to develop new tools for understanding and quantifying causal relationships in complex systems.
