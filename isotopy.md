**ASSISTANT**

Homotopy groups are fundamental concepts in algebraic topology, providing a powerful tool to study and classify topological spaces based on the idea of [[homotopy]], which is a type of continuous deformation between functions. There are various kinds of [[homotopy]] groups, with the most commonly encountered ones being the fundamental group and the higher [[homotopy]] groups. These groups capture information about the "shape" of a space in terms of its loops (closed paths) and higher-dimensional analogs.

### Fundamental Group ($\pi_1$)

The **fundamental group** is the first and most basic [[homotopy]] group, denoted as $\pi_1(X, x_0)$ for a topological space $X$ and a base point $x_0 \in X$. It consists of all loops based at $x_0$, where two loops are considered equivalent if one can be continuously deformed into the other (i.e., they are homotopic). The group operation is the concatenation of loops, and the inverse of a loop is the same loop traversed in the opposite direction.

The fundamental group captures information about the 1-dimensional "holes" in a space. For example:
- For a simply connected space (like $\mathbb{R}^n$ or a sphere), the fundamental group is trivial, i.e., $\pi_1(X, x_0) = \{e\}$, meaning there are no nontrivial loops that cannot be shrunk to a point.
- For a circle $S^1$, the fundamental group is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}$, reflecting the fact that loops around the circle can be wound around any number of times in either direction.

### Higher Homotopy Groups ($\pi_n$)

The **higher [[homotopy]] groups** generalize the concept of the fundamental group to $n$-dimensional loops, called $n$-spheres. The $n$-th [[homotopy]] group, $\pi_n(X, x_0)$, consists of maps from the $n$-dimensional sphere $S^n$ into the space $X$ that fix a base point $x_0$, with two such maps being equivalent if there is a continuous deformation from one to the other that also fixes the base point.

These groups explore the presence of "holes" in higher dimensions. For instance:
- The second [[homotopy]] group $\pi_2(X, x_0)$ deals with "spherical holes" that 2-spheres can loop around.
- Unlike $\pi_1$, the higher [[homotopy]] groups $\pi_n$ for $n > 1$ are always abelian.

### Calculating Homotopy Groups

Calculating [[homotopy]] groups is generally challenging, and the complete structure of these groups is known only for certain spaces. For example:
- The [[homotopy]] groups of spheres, especially $\pi_n(S^m)$ where $n$ is the dimension of the sphere and $m$ is the dimension of the [[homotopy]] group being considered, have been a central study area in algebraic topology. While the fundamental group of a sphere is trivial for all dimensions except $S^1$, the higher [[homotopy]] groups can be very complex.
- Techniques like the Hurewicz theorem, which relates [[homotopy]] groups to [[homology]] groups, and spectral sequences, provide tools for computing or estimating [[homotopy]] groups in certain cases.

### Significance

Homotopy groups are crucial in distinguishing between topological spaces that are otherwise similar. They provide invariants that can classify spaces up to [[homotopy]] equivalence, a weaker condition than homeomorphism (exact topological equivalence) but stronger than simple connectedness. Understanding the [[homotopy]] groups of a space gives deep insight into its topological and geometric structure, with applications ranging from the study of manifolds and fiber bundles to questions in theoretical physics.

isotopy


**ASSISTANT**

Isotopy is a concept from topology, particularly from the field of [[geometric topology]], that describes a continuous deformation between two geometric objects within a given space. It is a specific type of [[homotopy]], which is restricted to embeddings, meaning it deals with ways of continuously transforming one embedding of an object into another without "tearing" or "gluing" parts of the object. This concept is crucial for understanding the equivalence of geometric figures and structures under continuous transformations that preserve the object's topology.

### Formal Definition

Two embeddings $f, g: X \rightarrow Y$ of a topological space $X$ into a topological space $Y$ are **isotopic** if there exists a continuous family of embeddings $h_t: X \rightarrow Y$ for $t \in [0, 1]$ such that:

- $h_0 = f$ and $h_1 = g$.
- For each $t \in [0, 1]$, $h_t$ is an embedding.

The function $H: X \times [0, 1] \rightarrow Y$ defined by $H(x, t) = h_t(x)$ is called an **isotopy** between $f$ and $g$. Essentially, isotopy provides a "continuous path" of embeddings from $f$ to $g$, showing that one can be transformed into the other without intersecting itself or breaking apart.

### Isotopy vs. Homotopy

While both concepts involve continuous transformations, the distinction lies in their restrictions and applications:

- **Homotopy** requires only the continuity of the transformation and applies to continuous functions in general. It is a broader concept used to understand the equivalence of spaces and functions in a topological sense.

- **Isotopy**, on the other hand, applies specifically to embeddings and preserves the embedded object's "intactness" and "separateness" throughout the transformation. This makes isotopy a stricter condition than [[homotopy]].

### Applications of Isotopy

- **Knot Theory**: In knot theory, isotopy is used to define when two knots are considered the same. Two knots are equivalent if there is an isotopy of $\mathbb{R}^3$ (or $S^3$) that takes one knot onto the other. This concept helps classify knots and links.

- **Surface Classification**: Isotopy is used in the classification of surfaces and the study of surface homeomorphisms, determining when two surface embeddings are equivalent.

- **Differential Topology**: In differential topology, isotopy can distinguish between different smooth structures on manifolds, helping to understand the manifold's geometry and topology.

### Examples

- **Plane Curves**: Two simple closed curves on the plane are isotopic if one can be continuously deformed into the other without crossing itself.

- **Knots and Links**: Two knots in three-dimensional space are considered the same (or isotopic) if one can be transformed into the other through a continuous deformation of space that doesn't break or pass the string through itself.

Isotopy serves as a powerful tool in topology and geometry, providing a precise way to discuss the equivalence of geometric structures and embeddings. It captures the intuitive notion of shapes being "the same" if they can be transformed into each other through bending, twisting, and stretching, without tearing or gluing.
