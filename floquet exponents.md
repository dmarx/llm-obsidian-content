### Floquet Exponents

**Floquet exponents** are a fundamental concept in **Floquet theory**, used to analyze the stability of solutions to **linear differential equations with periodic coefficients**. These exponents describe the growth or decay rates of perturbations in such systems and are closely related to the system's **Floquet multipliers**. 

### Definition and Relationship with Floquet Multipliers

Consider a system of **linear differential equations** with **periodic coefficients**:

$$
\frac{d}{dt} \mathbf{x}(t) = A(t) \mathbf{x}(t),
$$

where:

- $\mathbf{x}(t) \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is the state vector,
- $A(t) \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ is a **periodic matrix** with period $T$, meaning $A(t + T) = A(t)$ for all $t$.

The fundamental solution matrix $\Phi(t)$ satisfies:

$$
\frac{d}{dt} \Phi(t) = A(t) \Phi(t), \quad \Phi(0) = I,
$$

where $I$ is the identity matrix. The matrix $\Phi(t)$ captures the evolution of solutions over time.

At $t = T$ (one period), the **[[monodromy matrix]]** $M$ is defined as:

$$
M = \Phi(T).
$$

The **Floquet multipliers** $\mu_i$ are the eigenvalues of the [[monodromy matrix]] $M$. These multipliers capture how solutions evolve over one period.

The **Floquet exponents** $\lambda_i$ are related to the Floquet multipliers by the equation:

$$
\mu_i = e^{\lambda_i T},
$$

where:

- $\lambda_i$ are the **Floquet exponents**.
- $T$ is the period of the system.

The Floquet exponents $\lambda_i$ describe the growth or decay rate of perturbations in a **continuous-time** framework. Each Floquet exponent corresponds to one of the system's modes and governs whether that mode grows, decays, or oscillates over time.

#### Real and Complex Floquet Exponents

Floquet exponents $\lambda_i$ can generally be complex, with the real and imaginary parts playing different roles:

- **Real part of Floquet exponent** $\text{Re}(\lambda_i)$: Determines whether the corresponding solution mode grows or decays. Specifically:
  - If $\text{Re}(\lambda_i) < 0$, the solution **decays** (stable mode).
  - If $\text{Re}(\lambda_i) > 0$, the solution **grows** (unstable mode).
  - If $\text{Re}(\lambda_i) = 0$, the solution is **marginally stable**.

- **Imaginary part of Floquet exponent** $\text{Im}(\lambda_i)$: Governs the **oscillatory behavior** of the solution. A non-zero imaginary part results in oscillations with frequency $\omega_i = \frac{\text{Im}(\lambda_i)}{2\pi}$.

Thus, a general solution to the system will consist of a combination of modes that may oscillate, grow, or decay, depending on the values of the Floquet exponents.

#### Stability Criterion Using Floquet Exponents

The stability of the system depends on the real part of the Floquet exponents:

- **Stable system**: If all $\text{Re}(\lambda_i) < 0$, all perturbations decay, and the system is asymptotically stable.
- **Unstable system**: If any $\text{Re}(\lambda_i) > 0$, at least one mode grows, and the system is unstable.
- **Marginally stable system**: If $\text{Re}(\lambda_i) = 0$ for some exponents, the system may exhibit sustained oscillations or neutral stability, depending on the imaginary parts.

#### Example: Simple Harmonic Oscillator with Periodic Coefficients

Consider the differential equation for a harmonic oscillator with time-periodic stiffness, a classic example that demonstrates the application of Floquet exponents. This is known as **Mathieu's equation**:

$$
\frac{d^2 x(t)}{dt^2} + \left( \omega_0^2 + \epsilon \cos(\Omega t) \right) x(t) = 0,
$$

where $\omega_0$ is the natural frequency of the oscillator, $\epsilon$ is the amplitude of the periodic variation in the stiffness, and $\Omega$ is the frequency of the periodic forcing.

To apply Floquet theory, we convert the second-order equation into a first-order system by introducing the variables $x_1(t) = x(t)$ and $x_2(t) = \frac{dx(t)}{dt}$:

$$
\frac{d}{dt}
\begin{pmatrix}
x_1(t) \\
x_2(t)
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 \\
-\left( \omega_0^2 + \epsilon \cos(\Omega t) \right) & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
x_1(t) \\
x_2(t)
\end{pmatrix}.
$$

This system has periodic coefficients with period $T = \frac{2\pi}{\Omega}$, so we can apply Floquet theory to determine its stability. 

By solving for the [[monodromy matrix]] $M$ numerically (or analytically in some cases), we obtain the Floquet multipliers $\mu_i$. From these, we compute the Floquet exponents $\lambda_i$ using:

$$
\lambda_i = \frac{\ln(\mu_i)}{T}.
$$

The real part of the Floquet exponents, $\text{Re}(\lambda_i)$, determines whether the oscillator exhibits **parametric resonance** (when $\lambda_i > 0$ for any $i$), which leads to exponential growth of the oscillation amplitude.

#### Computing Floquet Exponents

In general, Floquet exponents cannot be computed analytically for most systems. Instead, they are typically computed numerically using the following steps:

1. **Solve the fundamental matrix equation**: Numerically solve the linear system $\frac{d}{dt} \Phi(t) = A(t) \Phi(t)$ to compute the fundamental solution matrix $\Phi(t)$ over one period $T$.
   
2. **Obtain the [[monodromy matrix]]**: Evaluate the fundamental solution matrix at time $T$ to get the [[monodromy matrix]] $M = \Phi(T)$.

3. **Compute Floquet multipliers**: Find the eigenvalues $\mu_i$ of the [[monodromy matrix]] $M$.

4. **Calculate Floquet exponents**: Compute the Floquet exponents using:

   $$
   \lambda_i = \frac{\ln(\mu_i)}{T}.
   $$

Numerical tools like MATLAB (`ode45`, `floquet`, etc.) or Python (`scipy.integrate.odeint`) are often used to solve the system and compute Floquet exponents.

#### Example: Floquet Exponents in Delay Differential Equations (DDEs)

Floquet theory can also be applied to **delay differential equations (DDEs)** with periodic coefficients. For a linear DDE of the form:

$$
\frac{d}{dt} y(t) = A(t) y(t) + B(t) y(t - \tau),
$$

where $A(t)$ and $B(t)$ are periodic with period $T$, Floquet exponents can be computed by analyzing the **monodromy operator**, which maps the state over one period. The approach is conceptually similar to ODEs but often requires more sophisticated numerical methods, as the delay term introduces additional complexity.

#### Summary

- **Floquet exponents** $\lambda_i$ describe the long-term behavior of perturbations in systems with periodic coefficients.
- They are related to **Floquet multipliers** $\mu_i$ by $\mu_i = e^{\lambda_i T}$, where $T$ is the period.
- The **real part** of Floquet exponents, $\text{Re}(\lambda_i)$, determines whether a mode grows, decays, or remains bounded over time:
  - $\text{Re}(\lambda_i) < 0$: Mode decays (stable).
  - $\text{Re}(\lambda_i) > 0$: Mode grows (unstable).
  - $\text{Re}(\lambda_i) = 0$: Mode is marginally stable (bounded oscillations may occur).
- Floquet exponents are essential in the analysis of periodic systems across fields such as mechanical vibrations, control theory, and [[delay differential equations]], providing insight into the stability and long-term behavior of these systems.

Floquet theory, including Floquet exponents, offers a powerful framework for studying the stability of periodically driven or time-periodic systems across a wide range of applications.
