**USER**

Lorentz force


**ASSISTANT**

The **Lorentz force** describes the force experienced by a charged particle moving in the presence of electromagnetic fields. It is a fundamental concept in [[Electrodynamics]] and explains how electric and magnetic fields influence the motion of charged particles.

## Mathematical Formulation

For a particle of charge \( q \), velocity \( \mathbf{v} \), and subjected to an electric field \( \mathbf{E} \) and a magnetic field \( \mathbf{B} \), the Lorentz force \( \mathbf{F} \) is given by:

$$
\mathbf{F} = q \left( \mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B} \right).
$$

### Components:
- \( \mathbf{E} \): The electric field contributes a force \( q\mathbf{E} \), which is independent of the particle's velocity.
- \( \mathbf{B} \): The magnetic field contributes a velocity-dependent force \( q (\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}) \), which is perpendicular to both the velocity \( \mathbf{v} \) and the magnetic field \( \mathbf{B} \).

---

## Key Properties

1. **Nature of the Magnetic Force**:
   - The magnetic component of the Lorentz force is perpendicular to both \( \mathbf{v} \) and \( \mathbf{B} \), meaning it does no work on the particle (since \( \mathbf{F}_B \cdot \mathbf{v} = 0 \)).
   - It changes only the direction of the particle's velocity, not its speed.

2. **Nature of the Electric Force**:
   - The electric force \( q\mathbf{E} \) can accelerate or decelerate the particle, thereby changing its kinetic energy.

3. **Combining the Fields**:
   - The interplay between \( \mathbf{E} \) and \( \mathbf{B} \) leads to complex trajectories, such as spiral motion in crossed fields or drift motion in time-varying fields.

---

## Physical Interpretation

- **Electric Force**: Acts along \( \mathbf{E} \), accelerating the particle in the direction of \( \mathbf{E} \) (or opposite for negative charges).
- **Magnetic Force**: Deflects the particle into circular or helical motion due to the \( \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B} \) term.

## Dynamics of a Particle in a Uniform Magnetic Field

If \( \mathbf{E} = 0 \), the motion of a charged particle in a uniform \( \mathbf{B} \) field exhibits cyclotron motion:

1. **Centripetal Force**:
   The magnetic force provides the centripetal force necessary for circular motion:
   $$
   \frac{mv^2}{r} = qvB \implies r = \frac{mv}{qB},
   $$
   where \( r \) is the radius of the circular orbit (Larmor radius or gyroradius).

2. **Cyclotron Frequency**:
   The angular frequency of the circular motion is:
   $$
   \omega_c = \frac{v}{r} = \frac{qB}{m}.
   $$
   This is known as the **cyclotron frequency**.

3. **Helical Motion**:
   If the velocity has a component \( v_\parallel \) parallel to \( \mathbf{B} \), the particle's trajectory is a helix with pitch:
   $$
   p = v_\parallel T = \frac{2\pi v_\parallel m}{qB},
   $$
   where \( T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega_c} \) is the cyclotron period.

## Applications and Examples

### 1. **Charged Particle in Crossed Fields (\( \mathbf{E} \perp \mathbf{B} \))**:
- The particle experiences a drift with velocity:
  $$
  \mathbf{v}_\text{drift} = \frac{\mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{B}}{B^2}.
  $$
  This is known as the **\(\mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{B}\) drift**.

### 2. **Mass Spectrometry**:
- The Lorentz force is used in [[Mass Spectrometry|mass spectrometers]] to separate charged particles based on their charge-to-mass ratio \( q/m \).

### 3. **Cyclotrons and Synchrotrons**:
- Accelerators exploit the Lorentz force to confine and accelerate charged particles in circular trajectories.

### 4. **Plasma Physics**:
- In plasmas, the Lorentz force governs the motion of ions and electrons, leading to phenomena like magnetic confinement in fusion reactors.

The Lorentz force underpins many phenomena in classical and quantum physics, from the [[Zeeman Effect]] in spectroscopy to the dynamics of [[Landau Levels]] in quantum mechanics. Its cross-disciplinary applications make it one of the most important forces in modern physics and engineering.
