### National Employment Law Project (NELP)

The **National Employment Law Project (NELP)** is a nonprofit organization dedicated to advocating for policies and practices that improve job opportunities and working conditions for low-wage and unemployed workers. NELP focuses on ensuring fair treatment in the workplace, promoting access to good jobs, and strengthening labor standards.

#### Key Areas of Focus

1. **Workers' Rights**: NELP advocates for policies that protect workers' rights, including fair wages, safe working conditions, and protection against discrimination and retaliation.

3. **Workforce Development**: The organization promotes policies that expand access to job training and education, helping workers gain the skills needed for good jobs.
4. **Fair Hiring Practices**: NELP is a leading advocate for the Ban the Box initiative, which aims to reduce employment barriers for individuals with criminal records.

### Key Initiatives and Campaigns

#### Ban the Box

**Ban the Box** is a campaign led by NELP to remove questions about criminal history from initial job applications. The goal is to provide individuals with criminal records a fair chance at employment by delaying background checks until later in the hiring process.

**Key Objectives**:
- **Reduce Employment Discrimination**: By removing the checkbox asking about criminal records, Ban the Box aims to prevent early-stage discrimination and ensure that all candidates are considered based on their qualifications.
- **Promote Fair Hiring Practices**: Encourage employers to adopt fair and inclusive hiring practices, including individualized assessments of candidates' criminal histories.

**Impact**:
- Many states, cities, and private employers have adopted Ban the Box policies, helping to improve job prospects for millions of individuals with criminal records.

#### Raise the Minimum Wage

NELP advocates for raising the minimum wage to ensure that all workers earn a living wage that can support themselves and their families.

**Key Objectives**:
- **Economic Justice**: Increase the minimum wage to reduce poverty and income inequality.
- **Fair Pay**: Ensure that wages keep pace with the cost of living and reflect the value of work performed by low-wage workers.

**Impact**:
- Successful campaigns in several states and cities have led to significant increases in local minimum wage rates, benefiting millions of low-wage workers.

#### Worker Health and Safety

NELP works to strengthen workplace health and safety standards, ensuring that workers are protected from hazards and have safe working conditions.

**Key Objectives**:
- **Regulatory Advocacy**: Advocate for stronger health and safety regulations at the federal and state levels.
- **Worker Protections**: Promote policies that protect workers from retaliation when they report unsafe conditions.

**Impact**:
- NELP's advocacy has contributed to the implementation of stronger safety standards and protections for workers in various industries.

### Research and Publications

NELP produces a wide range of research reports, policy briefs, and publications that provide data, analysis, and recommendations on issues affecting low-wage and unemployed workers.

**Key Publications**:
- **Reports on Minimum Wage**: Analysis of the impacts of minimum wage increases on workers, businesses, and the economy.
