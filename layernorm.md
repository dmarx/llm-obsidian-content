**Layer Normalization** (LayerNorm) is a technique used in deep learning models to stabilize and accelerate training, particularly in recurrent and transformer architectures. Unlike batch normalization, which operates on a batch of inputs, layer normalization normalizes the inputs across the features of a single sample. This property makes it well-suited for models that operate on variable-length sequences, such as those found in natural language processing (NLP) and sequence modeling tasks.

## Definition and Mathematical Formalism

Given an input vector $x = (x_1, x_2, \dots, x_d) \in \mathbb{R}^d$ representing a single data sample from a batch, where $d$ is the dimensionality of the input features, the goal of layer normalization is to normalize this input to have zero mean and unit variance. The procedure can be broken down into a few key steps:

### Step 1: Compute the Mean and Variance

For an input vector $x$, the mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$ are computed across the feature dimensions:

$$
\mu = \frac{1}{d} \sum_{i=1}^{d} x_i, \quad \sigma^2 = \frac{1}{d} \sum_{i=1}^{d} (x_i - \mu)^2.
$$

Here, $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ are scalar values computed independently for each sample.

### Step 2: Normalize the Input

The input $x$ is then normalized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation:

$$
\hat{x}_i = \frac{x_i - \mu}{\sqrt{\sigma^2 + \epsilon}}, \quad i = 1, 2, \dots, d,
$$

where $\epsilon$ is a small constant (e.g., $10^{-5}$) added for numerical stability.

### Step 3: Scale and Shift (Affine Transformation)

After normalization, a learnable affine transformation is applied to allow the network to scale and shift the normalized values:

$$
y_i = \gamma \hat{x}_i + \beta, \quad i = 1, 2, \dots, d,
$$

where $\gamma \in \mathbb{R}^d$ and $\beta \in \mathbb{R}^d$ are learnable parameters that control the scaling and shifting, respectively. These parameters allow the model to recover the original activations if that is optimal.

### Combined Expression

Combining all the steps, the layer normalization output can be expressed as:

$$
y_i = \gamma \frac{x_i - \mu}{\sqrt{\sigma^2 + \epsilon}} + \beta, \quad i = 1, 2, \dots, d.
$$

This operation is applied independently to each input vector within a batch.

## Characteristics of Layer Normalization

1. **Sample-Wise Normalization:** Unlike [[Batch Normalization]], which normalizes across the batch, layer normalization normalizes the features within each individual sample. This makes it particularly effective for models that process variable-length inputs or operate on a sample-by-sample basis, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and transformers.

2. **Invariance to Batch Size:** Since it operates on individual samples, layer normalization is not affected by batch size. This is a significant advantage when training models on small batches or even a batch size of one, as is often the case in [[Reinforcement Learning]] or [[Natural Language Processing]] tasks.

3. **Position Invariance:** In contexts like transformers, layer normalization is often applied to inputs across different positions in a sequence. This invariance to position (or time step) allows the model to handle sequential data flexibly.

## Relationship with Other Normalization Techniques

- **Batch Normalization:** Batch normalization normalizes input features across the batch dimension, which can introduce problems when dealing with variable-length sequences or online learning. It also depends on the batch statistics during training and uses moving averages during inference.
  
- **Instance Normalization:** Similar to layer normalization, but it operates on each sample independently across spatial dimensions (primarily used in computer vision tasks).

- **Group Normalization:** Generalizes both batch normalization and layer normalization by dividing channels into groups, then normalizing within each group.

## Use in Transformers and Other Architectures

Layer normalization is commonly used in transformer architectures like [[Attention Mechanisms|self-attention]] models (e.g., the [[Transformer Model]]) because it effectively stabilizes training. In transformers, the normalization is typically applied before or after the attention and feedforward layers, improving gradient flow and allowing for deeper networks.

## Practical Considerations

- The choice of normalization method (layer normalization vs. batch normalization) depends on the architecture and the nature of the data. For sequence models and transformers, layer normalization is often the preferred choice due to its invariance to batch size and flexibility in handling variable-length inputs.

- The learnable parameters $\gamma$ and $\beta$ are crucial for preserving the model's capacity. Without them, normalization would restrict the model's representational power, making it harder to learn complex functions.

## Summary

Layer normalization stabilizes training by normalizing the inputs across feature dimensions within each sample. This approach is well-suited for models that process variable-length sequences or require position invariance, such as those found in natural language processing and sequence-to-sequence tasks. Its independence from batch size and reliance on per-sample statistics make it a robust alternative to batch normalization in many scenarios.
