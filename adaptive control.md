### Adaptive Control

Adaptive control is a control strategy that adjusts the parameters of the controller in real-time to handle uncertainties and variations in the system dynamics. This approach is particularly useful for systems with time-varying parameters, nonlinearities, or unmodeled dynamics.

### Key Concepts

1. **Parameter Estimation**: The controller uses real-time data to estimate the unknown parameters of the system.
2. **Controller Adjustment**: Based on the parameter estimates, the controller parameters are adjusted to ensure desired performance.
3. **Adaptation Law**: A rule or algorithm that dictates how the controller parameters are updated.

### Types of Adaptive Control

#### 1. Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC)

In MRAC, the control objective is to make the system output follow the output of a reference model. The reference model represents the desired system behavior.

- **Reference Model**: A model that defines the desired output trajectory \( y_m(t) \) given a reference input \( r(t) \).
- **Adaptive Law**: Adjusts the controller parameters to minimize the error between the system output \( y(t) \) and the reference model output \( y_m(t) \).

**MRAC Structure**:
- **Plant**: \( \dot{x}(t) = A x(t) + B u(t) \)
- **Reference Model**: \( \dot{x}_m(t) = A_m x_m(t) + B_m r(t) \)
- **Control Law**: \( u(t) = \theta^T(t) \phi(t) \)
- **Adaptation Law**: \( \dot{\theta}(t) = -\gamma \phi(t) e(t) \)
  - \( \phi(t) \): Regressor vector
  - \( e(t) = y(t) - y_m(t) \): Tracking error
  - \( \gamma \): Adaptation gain

#### 2. Self-Tuning Regulators (STR)

STR combines parameter estimation with control design. The controller parameters are updated based on the estimated parameters of the system.

- **System Identification**: Online estimation of the system parameters.
- **Control Design**: The control law is designed based on the estimated parameters.

**STR Structure**:
- **System Model**: \( y(t) = \theta^T \phi(t) + \epsilon(t) \)
  - \( \theta \): Parameter vector
  - \( \phi(t) \): Regressor vector
  - \( \epsilon(t) \): Modeling error
- **Parameter Estimation**: Recursive least squares or gradient methods to estimate \( \theta \).
- **Control Law**: Designed based on the estimated model.

### Adaptive Laws

Adaptive laws are rules that determine how the controller parameters are updated. Common adaptive laws include:

1. **Gradient Method**:
   $$ \dot{\theta}(t) = -\gamma \phi(t) e(t), $$
   where \( \gamma \) is the adaptation gain.

2. **Lyapunov Method**:
   Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, ensuring that the parameter updates lead to a decrease in a Lyapunov function, ensuring stability.

### Example: MRAC for a First-Order System

Consider a first-order system:
$$ \dot{x}(t) = -a x(t) + b u(t), $$
where \( a \) and \( b \) are unknown parameters.

#### Reference Model

The desired system behavior is specified by the reference model:
$$ \dot{x}_m(t) = -a_m x_m(t) + b_m r(t), $$
where \( a_m \) and \( b_m \) are chosen to reflect desired dynamics.

#### Control Law

The control input is given by:
$$ u(t) = \theta_1(t) r(t) + \theta_2(t) x(t), $$
where \( \theta_1(t) \) and \( \theta_2(t) \) are adaptive parameters.

#### Adaptation Law

Using the gradient method, the adaptation laws for the parameters are:
$$
\dot{\theta}_1(t) = -\gamma r(t) e(t), \\
\dot{\theta}_2(t) = -\gamma x(t) e(t),
$$
where \( e(t) = x(t) - x_m(t) \) is the tracking error, and \( \gamma \) is a positive adaptation gain.

### Advantages of Adaptive Control

1. **Robustness to Uncertainty**: Adaptive control can handle system uncertainties and variations in parameters.
2. **Improved Performance**: By continuously updating the controller parameters, adaptive control can achieve better performance compared to fixed-parameter controllers.
3. **Applicability to Nonlinear Systems**: Adaptive control techniques can be extended to nonlinear systems.

### Applications

1. **Aerospace**: Adaptive control is used in aircraft and spacecraft to handle changes in dynamics due to different flight conditions or damage.
2. **Robotics**: In robotic systems, adaptive control helps in dealing with payload variations and interaction with uncertain environments.
3. **Process Control**: Adaptive control is applied in chemical [[process control]] where system parameters can vary over time.

### Conclusion

Adaptive control provides a powerful framework for controlling systems with uncertain or time-varying parameters. By continuously estimating the system parameters and adjusting the controller accordingly, adaptive control ensures robust and high-performance operation.
