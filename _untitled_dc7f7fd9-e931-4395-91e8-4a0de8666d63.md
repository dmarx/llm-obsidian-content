. Understanding and addressing structural violence requires a comprehensive approach that includes policy reform, education, community empowerment, and international cooperation. By tackling the root causes of inequality and promoting social justice, we can work towards a world where everyone has the opportunity to live a healthy, fulfilling life free from systemic harm. Peace Studies provides the frameworks and tools necessary to address these deep-rooted issues and promote sustainable peace and justice.
