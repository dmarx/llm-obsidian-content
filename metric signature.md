### Metric Signature

The **metric signature** of a quadratic form or a metric tensor in a [[vector space]] is a triplet that specifies the counts of positive, negative, and zero entries (eigenvalues) in the diagonalized form of the metric tensor. This concept is particularly significant in contexts such as [[general relativity]], where the metric signature helps classify the nature of spacetime metrics.

#### Formal Definition

Given a metric tensor $g_{ij}$ defined on a [[vector space]] (or a manifold), the metric signature is defined in terms of the eigenvalues of the associated matrix. For a metric tensor $g_{ij}$ on an $n$-dimensional space, the signature is given as $(n_+, n_-, n_0)$ where:
- $n_+$ is the number of positive eigenvalues,
- $n_-$ is the number of negative eigenvalues,
- $n_0$ is the number of zero eigenvalues.

The signature is invariant under coordinate transformations that preserve the form of the quadratic expression.

#### Euclidean and Lorentzian Signatures

1. **Euclidean Signature**: In Euclidean space, the metric tensor $g_{ij}$ is typically the identity matrix or a positive-definite diagonal matrix. The signature of such a metric is $(n, 0, 0)$, indicating that all eigenvalues are positive.

2. **Lorentzian Signature**: In the context of [[general relativity]], the spacetime metric has a Lorentzian signature, usually denoted as $(3, 1, 0)$ or $(1, 3, 0)$. This indicates one negative eigenvalue (corresponding to time) and three positive eigenvalues (corresponding to spatial dimensions).

#### Example: Minkowski Space

The Minkowski metric in special relativity is a common example with the Lorentzian signature. The metric tensor in $(3+1)$-dimensional spacetime is given by:
$$
\eta_{\mu \nu} = \begin{pmatrix}
-1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}
$$
Here, the signature is $(3, 1, 0)$, indicating three positive eigenvalues and one negative eigenvalue.

#### Relation to Quadratic Forms

Consider a quadratic form associated with a symmetric matrix $A$:
$$
Q(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{x}^T A \mathbf{x}
$$
Diagonalizing $A$ yields a diagonal matrix $D$ with eigenvalues $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \ldots, \lambda_n$. The metric signature of $A$ is the triplet $(n_+, n_-, n_0)$, counting the positive, negative, and zero eigenvalues of $D$.

#### Invariance Under Coordinate Transformations

The metric signature is preserved under congruent transformations. If $A$ and $B$ are symmetric matrices such that $B = P^T A P$ for some nonsingular matrix $P$, then $A$ and $B$ have the same signature. This invariance is a direct consequence of [[Sylvester's Law of Inertia]].

### Applications

- **General Relativity**: The metric signature helps classify spacetime geometries. Different signatures can correspond to different physical interpretations of spacetime regions.
- **Differential Geometry**: In the study of manifolds, the metric signature influences the curvature properties and the types of geometric structures that can exist on the manifold.
- **Physics**: The metric signature in [[field]] theories affects the behavior of fields and particles, particularly in distinguishing between time-like, space-like, and null intervals.
