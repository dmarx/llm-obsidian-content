Susceptibility is a fundamental concept in various branches of physics, characterizing how a system responds to external fields. It quantitatively describes the degree to which a material becomes magnetized when exposed to a magnetic field (magnetic susceptibility) or polarized when exposed to an electric field (electric susceptibility). This concept is pivotal in understanding and designing materials for electronics, magnetics, and photonics applications, among others.

### Magnetic Susceptibility

Magnetic susceptibility ($\chi_m$) measures the ease with which a material can be magnetized. It is defined as the ratio of the magnetization $M$ (magnetic moment per unit volume) that a material acquires in response to an applied magnetic field $H$:

$$\chi_m = \frac{M}{H}.$$

For diamagnetic materials, which are weakly repelled by a magnetic field, $\chi_m$ is negative, indicating that the induced magnetization is in the opposite direction to the applied field. For paramagnetic materials, which are weakly attracted to a magnetic field, $\chi_m$ is positive, reflecting an induced magnetization in the direction of the applied field. Ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and ferrimagnetic materials can have very large positive susceptibilities and exhibit complex behavior, including hysteresis, below their Curie (ferromagnetic) or NÃ©el (antiferromagnetic) temperatures.

### Electric Susceptibility

Electric susceptibility ($\chi_e$) quantifies how much a material will become polarized in response to an applied electric field, thereby indicating the degree of its polarization $P$ relative to the electric field $E$:

$$\chi_e = \frac{P}{\epsilon_0 E},$$

where $\epsilon_0$ is the vacuum permittivity. The polarization $P$ represents the electric dipole moment induced per unit volume of the material. Materials with higher $\chi_e$ are more easily polarized. This property is crucial in the design and understanding of dielectrics used in capacitors, where stored energy is proportional to the susceptibility of the material.

### Frequency Dependence and Dispersion

Both magnetic and electric susceptibilities can depend on the frequency of the applied field. This frequency dependence, known as dispersion, arises because the mechanisms responsible for susceptibility (such as electronic orbital rearrangement, spin alignment, or ionic displacement) may not be able to respond instantaneously to the applied field. At higher frequencies, the response of the material can lag, leading to complex susceptibility values with real and imaginary components, where the imaginary part represents the energy dissipation within the material.

### Susceptibility and Phase Transitions

Near [[second-order phase transitions]], susceptibilities exhibit critical behavior, often diverging as the system approaches the critical temperature $T_c$ from above. For example, the magnetic susceptibility of a ferromagnet follows the Curie-Weiss law near $T_c$:

$$\chi_m = \frac{C}{T - T_c},$$

where $C$ is the Curie-Weiss constant. This divergence is a hallmark of critical phenomena, indicating long-range correlations in the system. Similar behavior is seen in electric susceptibility near phase transitions in ferroelectric materials.

### Applications

- **Magnetic Materials:** Understanding magnetic susceptibility is essential for designing magnetic storage media, sensors, and transformers.
- **Dielectrics:** Electric susceptibility informs the design of capacitors and insulators in electronic circuits.
- **Photonics:** The susceptibility of materials determines their optical properties, influencing the design of lenses, waveguides, and laser components.
- **Quantum Computing:** Materials with specific susceptibility profiles are explored for qubits and quantum information processing.

In summary, susceptibility offers a deep insight into the interaction between materials and electromagnetic fields, guiding the development of technologies across a broad spectrum of applications.
