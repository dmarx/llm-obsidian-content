Eady model of [[baroclinic instability]]


**ASSISTANT**

### Eady Model of Baroclinic Instability

The **Eady model** is a simplified theoretical framework used to study [[baroclinic instability]] and the formation of baroclinic waves. It provides insights into how perturbations grow in a stratified, rotating fluid, such as the Earth's atmosphere, under the influence of a temperature gradient and vertical wind shear.

#### Basic Assumptions

The Eady model makes several simplifying assumptions to make the problem analytically tractable:

1. **Constant Vertical Shear**: The model assumes a constant vertical shear of the geostrophic wind.
2. **Uniform Static Stability**: The atmosphere is assumed to have a constant Brunt-Väisälä frequency (\( N \)), which represents uniform static stability.
3. **Boussinesq Approximation**: Density variations are neglected except where they appear in buoyancy terms.
4. **Frictionless and Adiabatic**: The model neglects friction and assumes [[adiabatic processes]].
5. **Rigid Lid**: The model assumes a rigid upper boundary (top of the troposphere) and a flat lower boundary (surface).

#### Mathematical Formulation

1. **Basic State**: The basic state is characterized by a constant vertical wind shear and a horizontal temperature gradient. The geostrophic wind \( \mathbf{u}_g \) varies linearly with height:
   $$
   \mathbf{u}_g = \left( U_0 + \frac{\partial U}{\partial z} z \right) \hat{i}
   $$
   where \( U_0 \) is the reference wind speed, and \( \frac{\partial U}{\partial z} \) is the constant vertical shear.

2. **Quasi-Geostrophic Potential Vorticity (QGPV)**: The QGPV equation for perturbations in this basic state can be written as:
   $$
   \frac{\partial q'}{\partial t} + \mathbf{u}_g \cdot \nabla q' = 0
   $$
   where \( q' \) represents the perturbation QGPV.

3. **Linearized Perturbation Equations**: Assuming small perturbations, the linearized potential [[vorticity]] equation becomes:
   $$
   \left( \frac{\partial}{\partial t} + U_0 \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \right) \left( \nabla^2 \psi' + \frac{f_0^2}{N^2} \frac{\partial^2 \psi'}{\partial z^2} \right) + \frac{\partial U}{\partial z} \frac{\partial \psi'}{\partial z} = 0
   $$
   where \( \psi' \) is the perturbation streamfunction.

4. **Boundary Conditions**:
   - At the surface (\( z = 0 \)): \( \frac{\partial \psi'}{\partial z} = 0 \)
   - At the rigid lid (\( z = H \)): \( \frac{\partial \psi'}{\partial z} = 0 \)

#### Growth Rate and Wave Solution

The Eady model yields a solution for the perturbation streamfunction in the form of waves. The vertical structure of the solution is sinusoidal, and the wave grows exponentially over time due to [[baroclinic instability]].

1. **Vertical Structure**: The vertical structure of the perturbation is given by:
   $$
   \psi'(x, z, t) = \hat{\psi}(x, t) \cos\left( \frac{\pi z}{H} \right)
   $$

2. **Growth Rate (\( \sigma \))**: The maximum growth rate of the instability is:
   $$
   \sigma_{\text{max}} = 0.31 \left( \frac{f_0}{N} \right) \left| \frac{\partial U}{\partial z} \right|
   $$
   where \( \sigma_{\text{max}} \) is the growth rate of the most unstable mode, \( f_0 \) is the Coriolis parameter, \( N \) is the Brunt-Väisälä frequency, and \( \frac{\partial U}{\partial z} \) is the vertical wind shear.

3. **Wavelength of Maximum Instability**: The wavelength (\( \lambda \)) of the most unstable mode is given by:
   $$
   \lambda_{\text{max}} = 4 \pi \left( \frac{N H}{f_0} \right)
   $$

#### Physical Interpretation

- **Energy Conversion**: Baroclinic instability involves the conversion of available potential energy (due to horizontal temperature gradients) into kinetic energy, leading to the growth of perturbations.
- **Vertical Tilt**: The perturbations in the Eady model have a characteristic vertical tilt, with warm air rising and cold air sinking, which is essential for the growth of baroclinic waves.
- **Impact on Weather Systems**: Baroclinic waves play a crucial role in the development and evolution of mid-latitude cyclones, which are responsible for much of the weather variability in the mid-latitudes.

#### Example: Application of the Eady Model

Consider an atmosphere with the following parameters:
- Coriolis parameter (\( f_0 \)): \( 1 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{s}^{-1} \)
- Brunt-Väisälä frequency (\( N \)): \( 0.01 \, \text{s}^{-1} \)
- Vertical wind shear (\( \frac{\partial U}{\partial z} \)): \( 0.01 \, \text{s}^{-1} \)
- Depth of the atmosphere (\( H \)): \( 10 \, \text{km} \)

1. **Maximum Growth Rate**:
   $$
   \sigma_{\text{max}} = 0.31 \left( \frac{1 \times 10^{-4}}{0.01} \right) \left( 0.01 \right) = 3.1 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{s}^{-1}
   $$
   This growth rate indicates how rapidly the most unstable mode grows over time.

2. **Wavelength of Maximum Instability**:
   $$
   \lambda_{\text{max}} = 4 \pi \left( \frac{0.01 \times 10^4}{1 \times 10^{-4}} \right) = 1.26 \times 10^3 \, \text{km}
   $$
   This wavelength is typical for mid-latitude baroclinic waves and corresponds to the scale of synoptic weather systems.

### Conclusion

The Eady model provides a fundamental understanding of [[baroclinic instability]] and the development of baroclinic waves. Despite its simplifying assumptions, it captures the essential dynamics of how temperature gradients and vertical wind shear drive the growth of atmospheric disturbances. This model is instrumental in explaining the formation and behavior of mid-latitude cyclones, contributing to [[weather forecasting]] and climate dynamics.
