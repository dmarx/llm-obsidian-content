Work (physics)


**ASSISTANT**

In physics, *work* is a fundamental concept that describes the transfer of energy from one system to another by means of a force acting over a distance. Mathematically, the work \(W\) done by a force \(\mathbf{F}\) on an object as it moves through a displacement \(\mathbf{d}\) is given by the dot product of the force and the displacement vectors.

### Mathematical Definition

For a constant force \(\mathbf{F}\) acting along a straight path, the work done is:
$$
W = \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{d} = F d \cos \theta
$$
where:
- \( \mathbf{F} \) is the force vector,
- \( \mathbf{d} \) is the displacement vector,
- \( F \) is the magnitude of the force,
- \( d \) is the magnitude of the displacement,
- \( \theta \) is the angle between the force and displacement vectors.

The dot product ensures that only the component of the force parallel to the displacement contributes to the work done.

### Work in Variable Force Scenarios

If the force varies along the path of motion, the work done is determined by integrating the force along the path of the displacement. In a general form, if the force is a function of position \(\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r})\), the work done from point \(\mathbf{r}_1\) to point \(\mathbf{r}_2\) is:
$$
W = \int_{\mathbf{r}_1}^{\mathbf{r}_2} \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}) \cdot d\mathbf{r}
$$

### Work-Energy Theorem

The work-energy theorem connects the concept of work to changes in [[kinetic energy]]. It states that the net work \(W_{\text{net}}\) done on an object is equal to the change in its [[kinetic energy]] \(\Delta K\):
$$
W_{\text{net}} = \Delta K = \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 - \frac{1}{2}mv_i^2
$$
where \(m\) is the mass of the object, \(v_f\) is the final velocity, and \(v_i\) is the initial velocity.

### Conservative and Non-Conservative Forces

- **Conservative Forces**: Work done by conservative forces (e.g., gravitational, electrostatic) is path-independent and can be expressed as the negative change in [[potential energy]] \(\Delta U\):
  $$
  W_{\text{cons}} = -\Delta U
  $$
  This property allows the definition of a [[potential energy]] function \(U(\mathbf{r})\) such that \(\mathbf{F} = -\nabla U\).

- **Non-Conservative Forces**: Work done by non-conservative forces (e.g., friction) depends on the path taken and generally dissipates energy as heat or other forms of energy.

### Examples

1. **Gravitational Work**:
   For an object of mass \(m\) raised vertically by a height \(h\) in a uniform gravitational field \(g\):
   $$
   W_{\text{gravity}} = mgh
   $$
   Here, the force due to gravity is \(mg\) and the displacement in the direction of the force is \(h\).

2. **Spring Work**:
   For a spring obeying Hooke's Law, where the force is \(F = -kx\) and \(k\) is the spring constant:
   $$
   W_{\text{spring}} = \int_{0}^{x} (-kx) \, dx = -\frac{1}{2}kx^2
   $$
   This is the work done to compress or extend the spring by a distance \(x\).

### Conclusion

Work is a critical concept in understanding how forces interact with objects to transfer energy, influencing the object's motion and energy state. The precise calculation of work depends on the nature of the force and the path taken by the object.
