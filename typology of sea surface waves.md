### Typology of Sea Surface Waves

Sea surface waves are disturbances on the ocean surface, typically generated by wind, but also by other factors such as seismic activity ([[tsunamis]]), gravitational forces (tides), and human activities. These waves can vary widely in size, shape, and behavior, depending on the generating forces and the environment in which they form. Understanding the typology of sea surface waves is essential in fields such as [[oceanography]], coastal engineering, and maritime navigation.

### Types of Sea Surface Waves

1. **Wind-Generated Waves**

   - **Capillary Waves**:
     - **Description**: The smallest type of surface waves, with wavelengths typically less than a few centimeters. These waves are primarily generated by light winds and surface tension is the dominant restoring force.
     - **Characteristics**: Capillary waves have short wavelengths and tend to have smooth, rounded crests. They are often the first waves to form when the wind begins to blow over a calm water surface.
     - **Restoring Force**: Surface tension.
     - **Significance**: Capillary waves can grow into larger waves ([[gravity waves]]) as wind continues to blow.

   - **Gravity Waves**:
     - **Description**: Gravity waves are the most common type of waves found on the ocean surface, with wavelengths ranging from a few meters to several hundred meters. They are generated by the wind, and gravity is the primary restoring force that pulls the water back down after it has been displaced.
     - **Characteristics**: These waves have longer wavelengths and higher amplitudes compared to capillary waves. They can appear as gentle undulations in the sea or as larger, more energetic waves.
     - **Restoring Force**: Gravity.
     - **Subtypes**:
       - **Sea**: Waves that are still being generated by the wind in the local area. They are often chaotic and irregular in shape.
       - **Swell**: Waves that have traveled out of their generating area. Swells are more regular, with longer wavelengths and periods, and can travel across entire ocean basins.
     - **Significance**: Gravity waves are the most significant type of waves for navigation, coastal processes, and energy transfer in the ocean.

   - **Rogue Waves**:
     - **Description**: Extremely large, unexpected, and often dangerous waves that can appear suddenly on the ocean surface. Rogue waves are much larger than the surrounding waves and are often associated with wave interference and amplification.
     - **Characteristics**: Rogue waves can reach heights of 20 meters (65 feet) or more and may occur in any sea state, often forming due to the constructive interference of multiple wave trains.
     - **Restoring Force**: Gravity.
     - **Significance**: Rogue waves pose significant hazards to ships and offshore structures.

2. **Long-Period Waves**

   - **Tsunamis**:
     - **Description**: Tsunamis are long-period waves generated primarily by underwater seismic activity, such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or landslides. They can also be caused by the impact of meteorites.
     - **Characteristics**: Tsunamis have very long wavelengths, often exceeding 100 kilometers (62 miles), and travel across the ocean at high speeds (up to 700 km/h or 435 mph). In deep water, they have low wave heights, but they can grow significantly as they approach shallow coastal areas.
     - **Restoring Force**: Gravity.
     - **Significance**: Tsunamis can cause devastating coastal flooding and destruction when they reach shore.

   - **Tides**:
     - **Description**: Tides are long-period waves generated by the gravitational pull of the Moon and the Sun on Earth’s oceans. They result in the periodic rise and fall of sea levels across the globe.
     - **Characteristics**: Tides have extremely long wavelengths, often thousands of kilometers, and consist of two main components: high tide (when the sea level is at its highest) and low tide (when it is at its lowest). Tidal cycles typically occur over 12.4 hours (semi-diurnal tides) or 24.8 hours (diurnal tides).
     - **Restoring Force**: Gravity.
     - **Significance**: Tides are crucial for coastal navigation, fishing, and the operation of tidal energy systems.

   - **Seiches**:
     - **Description**: Seiches are standing waves that oscillate in enclosed or semi-enclosed bodies of water, such as bays, harbors, or lakes, often caused by atmospheric pressure changes, seismic activity, or sudden changes in wind.
     - **Characteristics**: Seiches have long wavelengths and periods that can range from minutes to hours. They typically form when a standing wave is reflected back upon itself within a bounded body of water, creating a rhythmic oscillation.
     - **Restoring Force**: Gravity.
     - **Significance**: Seiches can lead to fluctuating water levels in harbors and can pose a risk to coastal infrastructure if large enough.

3. **Specialized Wave Types**

   - **Internal Waves**:
     - **Description**: Internal waves occur within the ocean, at the interface between layers of water with different densities, typically due to temperature or salinity differences. These waves are not visible on the surface but can be detected by changes in temperature, salinity, or the motion of underwater particles.
     - **Characteristics**: Internal waves have much longer wavelengths and periods compared to surface waves, and they can propagate horizontally for hundreds of kilometers. They are often generated by tidal forces, wind, or the flow of water over underwater topography.
     - **Restoring Force**: Gravity, acting on the density difference between layers.
     - **Significance**: Internal waves play a significant role in mixing ocean layers and transporting nutrients and energy within the ocean.

   - **Kelvin Waves**:
     - **Description**: Kelvin waves are a type of gravity wave that propagates along coastlines or the equator, influenced by the Coriolis effect. They are often associated with large-scale oceanic and atmospheric phenomena, such as El Niño events.
     - **Characteristics**: Kelvin waves travel along a boundary (coastline or equator) with their amplitude decreasing exponentially away from the boundary. In the equatorial region, they play a crucial role in the dynamics of ENSO (El Niño-Southern Oscillation).
     - **Restoring Force**: Gravity, with significant influence from the Coriolis effect.
     - **Significance**: Kelvin waves are important in the study of large-scale ocean circulation and climate variability.

   - **Rossby Waves**:
     - **Description**: Rossby waves, also known as planetary waves, are large-scale waves influenced by the rotation of the Earth. They are significant in the atmosphere as well as the ocean, playing a critical role in the dynamics of ocean currents and atmospheric circulation.
     - **Characteristics**: Rossby waves have very long wavelengths and low frequencies, often traveling westward. In the ocean, they influence the large-scale movement of ocean currents and are a key factor in the stability and variability of the ocean’s circulation.
     - **Restoring Force**: Coriolis effect and planetary vorticity.
     - **Significance**: Rossby waves are fundamental in understanding the large-scale dynamics of the ocean and atmosphere, including the development of weather patterns and climate anomalies.

### Wave Properties and Dynamics

- **Wavelength**: The horizontal distance between two successive wave crests or troughs.
- **Wave Height**: The vertical distance between the crest and the trough of a wave.
- **Wave Period**: The time it takes for two successive wave crests to pass a fixed point.
- **Wave Speed**: The speed at which a wave travels through the water, which depends on the wavelength and the water depth.
- **Wave Energy**: The energy transported by a wave, proportional to the square of the wave height. Larger waves carry significantly more energy.

### Conclusion

The typology of sea surface waves encompasses a wide range of wave types, each with distinct characteristics and driving mechanisms. From the small capillary waves formed by light breezes to the powerful [[tsunamis]] triggered by seismic events, understanding these different wave types is essential for navigation, coastal management, climate studies, and the protection of marine infrastructure. Each wave type plays a unique role in the ocean’s dynamic system, influencing everything from local coastal processes to global climate patterns.
