Stable Homotopy Theory


**ASSISTANT**

**Stable homotopy theory** is a branch of algebraic topology that studies spaces and maps between them in a "stable" setting, where the behavior of spaces and homotopy groups becomes more regular as dimensions increase. It generalizes classical **homotopy theory** by focusing on the properties of spaces and their **suspensions**, and it plays a fundamental role in modern topology, including areas like **[[cobordism theory]]**, **Thom spectra**, and the **stable homotopy groups of spheres**.

### Motivation: Classical vs. Stable Homotopy Theory

In classical homotopy theory, we study continuous maps between spaces up to **homotopy**, meaning that two maps are equivalent if one can be continuously deformed into the other. The main objects of interest are **homotopy groups**, \( \pi_n(X) \), which describe the \( n \)-dimensional structure of a space \( X \). However, these homotopy groups often exhibit complicated, irregular behavior as \( n \) increases, especially for **spheres**.

To address these complexities, stable homotopy theory introduces the concept of **stabilization** through the **suspension** operation. By considering spaces in the limit of repeated suspensions, we obtain **stable homotopy groups**, which exhibit more predictable and structured behavior.

### The Suspension and Loop Space Functors

Two central operations in stable homotopy theory are **suspension** and **looping**:

1. **Suspension**: Given a topological space \( X \), the **suspension** \( \Sigma X \) is a new space obtained by "stretching" \( X \) into a higher-dimensional space by attaching a cone to both ends of \( X \). Formally, the suspension of \( X \) is the quotient space:

   $$
   \Sigma X = S^1 \wedge X = (S^1 \times X) / (S^1 \vee X),
   $$

   where \( S^1 \) is the circle and \( \wedge \) denotes the **smash product**.

   The suspension functor increases the dimension of spaces, and it induces maps between homotopy groups, which tend to become more stable as we apply suspension repeatedly.

2. **Loop Space**: The **loop space** \( \Omega X \) of a space \( X \) is the space of all continuous loops in \( X \) (maps from \( S^1 \) to \( X \)) that start and end at a base point. Loop spaces have the property of **decreasing dimension**.

   Repeated application of the loop space functor leads to an inverse stabilization process that provides the structure for **stable homotopy groups**.

### Stable Homotopy Groups

Stable homotopy groups are defined as the homotopy groups that remain invariant under repeated suspension. More formally, the **stable homotopy group** of a space \( X \) is the limit:

$$
\pi_n^{\text{stable}}(X) = \lim_{k \to \infty} \pi_{n+k}(\Sigma^k X).
$$

This limit is well-defined because, for sufficiently large \( k \), the homotopy groups \( \pi_{n+k}(\Sigma^k X) \) stabilize, meaning they stop changing as \( k \) increases. These stable homotopy groups capture essential, regularized information about the space.

### Spectra and Stable Homotopy Theory

The framework of **spectra** provides a formal way to study stable homotopy theory. A **spectrum** is a sequence of spaces \( \{ X_n \} \) together with structure maps:

$$
\Sigma X_n \to X_{n+1}.
$$

A spectrum can be thought of as a stable version of a space, and it allows for the definition of **stable homotopy groups** in a systematic way.

#### Homotopy Groups of a Spectrum

For a given spectrum \( E \), the stable homotopy groups \( \pi_n(E) \) are defined as:

$$
\pi_n(E) = \lim_{k \to \infty} \pi_{n+k}(X_k),
$$

where \( X_k \) is the \( k \)-th space in the spectrum, and the limit stabilizes the homotopy groups. These groups are the central objects of study in stable homotopy theory.

#### Examples of Spectra

1. **Sphere Spectrum**: The most fundamental example is the **sphere spectrum** \( \mathbb{S} \), which is the suspension spectrum of a point. The homotopy groups of the sphere spectrum are known as the **stable homotopy groups of spheres**, denoted \( \pi_n^{\text{stable}}(S^0) \), and they are central to the field.

2. **Thom Spectra**: Thom spectra \( MG \) arise in **[[cobordism theory]]** and correspond to cobordism classes of manifolds with a structure group \( G \). Examples include:
   - \( MO \), the spectrum for **unoriented cobordism**.
   - \( MSO \), the spectrum for **oriented cobordism**.
   - \( MU \), the spectrum for **complex cobordism**.
   
   These spectra are crucial for understanding the homotopy-theoretic aspects of cobordism.

3. **Eilenberg-MacLane Spectrum**: For any abelian group \( G \), the **Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum** \( H G \) represents the cohomology theory with coefficients in \( G \). These spectra are used to define ordinary cohomology in stable homotopy theory.

### Stable Homotopy Groups of Spheres

The **stable homotopy groups of spheres** \( \pi_n^{\text{stable}}(S^0) \) are among the most fundamental and mysterious objects in algebraic topology. They capture the "stable" information about spheres across all dimensions, and they are computed using the sphere spectrum.

Although calculating the stable homotopy groups of spheres is an immensely difficult task, some important facts include:

- \( \pi_0^{\text{stable}}(S^0) = \mathbb{Z} \), meaning the stable homotopy group of degree zero corresponds to the integers.
- Higher stable homotopy groups are highly structured and exhibit complex torsion phenomena.

### Spectra and Generalized Cohomology Theories

Stable homotopy theory plays a key role in defining **generalized cohomology theories**, which are cohomology theories represented by spectra. Each spectrum \( E \) defines a cohomology theory \( E^*(X) \) for a space \( X \), with:

$$
E^n(X) = [X, \Sigma^n E],
$$

where \( [X, \Sigma^n E] \) denotes the set of stable homotopy classes of maps from \( X \) to \( \Sigma^n E \). Examples of generalized cohomology theories include:

- **K-theory**: Based on the **K-theory spectrum**, which classifies vector bundles.
- **Complex Cobordism**: Defined by the spectrum \( MU \), complex [[cobordism theory]] plays a major role in stable homotopy theory and algebraic geometry.
- **Morava K-theories**: Important in the study of structured ring spectra and chromatic homotopy theory.

### Applications of Stable Homotopy Theory

1. **Cobordism Theory**: Cobordism groups are often calculated using stable homotopy theory and Thom spectra, which encode cobordism classes as stable homotopy groups.

2. **Characteristic Classes**: Characteristic classes, such as **Stiefel-Whitney classes**, **Chern classes**, and **Pontryagin classes**, can be understood in the framework of generalized cohomology theories, which are constructed using spectra in stable homotopy theory.

3. **Algebraic Geometry**: Stable homotopy theory, particularly through **complex cobordism** and the **Thom spectrum** \( MU \), plays a key role in algebraic geometry, where it is used to study formal group laws and complex-oriented cohomology theories.

4. **Homotopy Theory**: Stable homotopy groups simplify many problems in classical homotopy theory by focusing on the "stable" aspects of spaces. These groups provide deep insights into the structure of topological spaces and their maps.

5. **Mathematical Physics**: Stable homotopy theory has applications in **string theory**, **quantum field theory**, and **topological quantum field theory** (TQFT), where spectra are used to classify the possible topologies of space-time and the behavior of quantum fields.

### Summary

**Stable homotopy theory** studies spaces and maps between them in a "stable" setting, where homotopy groups become invariant under suspension. The main objects of study are **spectra** and their stable homotopy groups, which generalize classical homotopy groups. Stable homotopy theory has deep connections to [[cobordism theory]], generalized cohomology, [[characteristic classes]], and mathematical physics.
