Cauchy-Riemann Equations


**ASSISTANT**

The Cauchy-Riemann equations are fundamental conditions in complex analysis that a complex function must satisfy to be differentiable, or holomorphic, at a point. These equations provide a bridge between complex differentiability and real partial derivatives, linking the function's behavior in the complex plane to its behavior in the real plane.

### Definition

Consider a complex function \( f(z) \) where \( z = x + iy \) and \( f(z) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y) \). Here, \( u(x,y) \) and \( v(x,y) \) are real-valued functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \( f(z) \), respectively.

The Cauchy-Riemann equations state that for \( f(z) \) to be holomorphic at a point \( z_0 = x_0 + iy_0 \), the partial derivatives of \( u \) and \( v \) must satisfy the following conditions at \( (x_0, y_0) \):

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}
$$
$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = -\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}
$$

### Derivation

The Cauchy-Riemann equations can be derived from the definition of complex differentiability. A function \( f(z) \) is said to be complex differentiable at \( z_0 \) if the limit

$$
f'(z_0) = \lim_{\Delta z \to 0} \frac{f(z_0 + \Delta z) - f(z_0)}{\Delta z}
$$

exists and is the same regardless of the direction from which \( \Delta z \) approaches zero.

By expressing \( \Delta z \) in two different ways (approaching along the real axis and along the imaginary axis) and requiring these limits to be equal, we obtain the Cauchy-Riemann equations.

### Intuitive Interpretation

- **Conformal Mapping**: If \( f(z) \) satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations, then the function locally preserves angles and shapes (up to scaling). This property is crucial in conformal mappings, which are used extensively in complex analysis and related fields.

- **Gradient Interpretation**: The equations imply that the gradients of \( u \) and \( v \) are orthogonal and of equal magnitude. This orthogonality is essential for \( f \) to be holomorphic.

### Examples

#### Example 1: \( f(z) = z^2 \)

For \( f(z) = z^2 \), where \( z = x + iy \):
$$
f(z) = (x + iy)^2 = x^2 - y^2 + i(2xy)
$$

Here, \( u(x,y) = x^2 - y^2 \) and \( v(x,y) = 2xy \). Compute the partial derivatives:
$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 2x, \quad \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = -2y
$$
$$
\frac{\partial v}{\partial x} = 2y, \quad \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} = 2x
$$

Check the Cauchy-Riemann equations:
$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 2x \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} = 2x
$$
$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = -2y \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} = 2y
$$

Since the equations are satisfied, \( f(z) = z^2 \) is holomorphic everywhere in the complex plane.

#### Example 2: \( f(z) = \overline{z} \)

For \( f(z) = \overline{z} \), where \( z = x + iy \) and \( \overline{z} = x - iy \):
$$
f(z) = x - iy
$$

Here, \( u(x,y) = x \) and \( v(x,y) = -y \). Compute the partial derivatives:
$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 1, \quad \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = 0
$$
$$
\frac{\partial v}{\partial x} = 0, \quad \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} = -1
$$

Check the Cauchy-Riemann equations:
$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} = -1
$$
$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} = 0
$$

The equations are not satisfied, so \( f(z) = \overline{z} \) is not holomorphic.

### Applications

1. **Complex Integration**: The Cauchy-Riemann equations are fundamental in proving Cauchy's theorem and Cauchy's integral formula, which are central to complex integration.

2. **Fluid Dynamics**: In fluid dynamics, the velocity potential and stream function satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations, describing incompressible and irrotational flow.

3. **Electrostatics**: In electrostatics, the potential function and its harmonic conjugate satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations, describing the electric field.

### Summary

The Cauchy-Riemann equations provide necessary conditions for a function of a complex variable to be holomorphic. They link the partial derivatives of the real and imaginary parts of the function and are fundamental in various applications of complex analysis.
