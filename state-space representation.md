### State-Space Representation

State-space representation is a mathematical framework used to describe the behavior of dynamic systems. It provides a comprehensive way to model and analyze systems using a set of first-order differential equations. This approach is particularly powerful for multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) systems and for systems that are best described by internal state variables.

### Key Components of State-Space Representation

1. **State Variables**: A set of variables that describe the system's state at any given time.
2. **State Equations**: Differential equations that describe how the state variables evolve over time.
3. **Output Equations**: Algebraic equations that describe how the output of the system is related to the state variables and inputs.

### Standard Form

The state-space representation of a linear time-invariant (LTI) system is given by:

$$
\dot{x}(t) = A x(t) + B u(t),
$$

$$
y(t) = C x(t) + D u(t),
$$

where:
- \( x(t) \) is the state vector, an \( n \times 1 \) column vector where \( n \) is the number of state variables.
- \( u(t) \) is the input vector, a \( p \times 1 \) column vector where \( p \) is the number of inputs.
- \( y(t) \) is the output vector, a \( q \times 1 \) column vector where \( q \) is the number of outputs.
- \( A \) is the state matrix, an \( n \times n \) matrix.
- \( B \) is the input matrix, an \( n \times p \) matrix.
- \( C \) is the output matrix, a \( q \times n \) matrix.
- \( D \) is the feedthrough (or direct transmission) matrix, a \( q \times p \) matrix.

### Example: Mass-Spring-Damper System

Consider a mass-spring-damper system where \( m \) is the mass, \( b \) is the damping coefficient, and \( k \) is the spring constant. The differential equation describing the system is:

$$
m \ddot{x} + b \dot{x} + k x = u,
$$

where \( x \) is the displacement and \( u \) is the external force applied to the mass.

#### Step 1: Define State Variables

Choose the state variables as:
- \( x_1 = x \) (displacement)
- \( x_2 = \dot{x} \) (velocity)

Thus, the state vector \( x \) is:

$$
x = \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} x \\ \dot{x} \end{bmatrix}.
$$

#### Step 2: Write State Equations

Rewrite the second-order differential equation as two first-order differential equations:

$$
\dot{x}_1 = x_2,
$$

$$
\dot{x}_2 = -\frac{k}{m} x_1 - \frac{b}{m} x_2 + \frac{1}{m} u.
$$

In matrix form, these equations are:

$$
\begin{bmatrix} \dot{x}_1 \\ \dot{x}_2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -\frac{k}{m} & -\frac{b}{m} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ \frac{1}{m} \end{bmatrix} u.
$$

#### Step 3: Write Output Equation

Assume the output is the displacement \( x \), so:

$$
y = x_1.
$$

In matrix form, the output equation is:

$$
y = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} 0 \end{bmatrix} u.
$$

#### State-Space Representation

The state-space representation of the mass-spring-damper system is:

$$
\dot{x}(t) = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -\frac{k}{m} & -\frac{b}{m} \end{bmatrix} x(t) + \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ \frac{1}{m} \end{bmatrix} u(t),
$$

$$
y(t) = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} x(t).
$$

### Advantages of State-Space Representation

1. **Applicable to MIMO Systems**: Easily handles multi-input, multi-output systems.
2. **Time-Domain Analysis**: Describes system behavior in the time domain, making it suitable for time-domain simulations.
3. **Incorporates Internal States**: Provides a comprehensive description of the system by including internal state variables.
4. **Facilitates Modern Control Design**: Supports advanced control design techniques like state feedback, observers, and optimal control.

### Converting Transfer Function to State-Space

A system described by a transfer function can be converted to state-space form using several methods. One common approach is the controllable canonical form.

#### Example: Transfer Function to State-Space

Consider a transfer function:

$$
G(s) = \frac{Y(s)}{U(s)} = \frac{b_0 s^m + b_1 s^{m-1} + \cdots + b_m}{s^n + a_1 s^{n-1} + \cdots + a_n}.
$$

To convert this to state-space form:

1. **Controllable Canonical Form**:

   - State vector: \( x = \begin{bmatrix} x_1 & x_2 & \cdots & x_n \end{bmatrix}^T \), where \( x_i \) are intermediate variables.

   - State equations:

     $$
     \dot{x} = \begin{bmatrix}
     0 & 1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
     0 & 0 & 1 & \cdots & 0 \\
     \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
     0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 1 \\
     -a_n & -a_{n-1} & -a_{n-2} & \cdots & -a_1
     \end{bmatrix} x + \begin{bmatrix}
     0 \\
     0 \\
     \vdots \\
     0 \\
     1
     \end{bmatrix} u.
     $$

   - Output equation (assuming \( y = x_1 \)):

     $$
     y = \begin{bmatrix}
     b_0 & b_1 & b_2 & \cdots & b_m
     \end{bmatrix} x.
     $$

### Conclusion

State-space representation provides a powerful and flexible framework for modeling and analyzing dynamic systems. It is particularly well-suited for modern control design techniques and handling complex systems with multiple inputs and outputs.
