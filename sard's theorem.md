Sard's Theorem


**ASSISTANT**

**Sard's Theorem** is a fundamental result in differential topology with significant implications in the study of smooth maps and the structure of manifolds. It states that the set of critical values of a smooth map has measure zero. This theorem is crucial for understanding the behavior of smooth functions and for proving other important theorems in topology and geometry, such as the Transversality Theorem.

### Statement of Sard's Theorem

Let \( f: M \to N \) be a smooth map between smooth manifolds \( M \) and \( N \) with dimensions \( \dim(M) = m \) and \( \dim(N) = n \). A point \( p \in M \) is a **critical point** of \( f \) if the differential \( df_p: T_p M \to T_{f(p)} N \) is not surjective. The **critical value** is \( f(p) \in N \) for some critical point \( p \).

**Sard's Theorem** states:
1. If \( f: M \to N \) is a smooth map with \( m \geq n \), then the set of critical values of \( f \) has measure zero in \( N \).
2. If \( f \) is smooth, the set of regular values is dense in \( N \).

### Implications

1. **Regular Values**: Almost every point in the target manifold \( N \) is a regular value. A regular value is a point in the codomain such that every point in the preimage is a regular point (where the differential is surjective).

2. **Transversality**: Sard's Theorem underpins the Transversality Theorem, which states that for a smooth map \( f \) and a submanifold \( S \) of \( N \), a small perturbation of \( f \) can be made transverse to \( S \). This means that intersections between \( f \) and \( S \) occur in the most "generic" way possible.

3. **Morse Theory**: In Morse Theory, Sard's Theorem ensures that the critical values of a smooth function are isolated, allowing the decomposition of manifolds into simpler pieces.

### Applications

1. **Manifold Theory**: Sard's Theorem is used to prove that the set of singular values of a smooth map has measure zero, facilitating the study of immersions and submersions.
2. **Intersection Theory**: Helps in defining and understanding intersections of submanifolds in a generic way.
3. **Mathematical Analysis**: In the analysis of critical points and the structure of level sets of smooth functions.

### Example

Consider a smooth function \( f: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R} \) defined by \( f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \). The critical points are those where the gradient \( \nabla f = (2x, 2y) \) is zero, which occurs only at \((0, 0)\). The critical value is \( f(0, 0) = 0 \). According to Sard's Theorem, the set of critical values of \( f \) (in this case, just \{0\}) has measure zero in \(\mathbb{R}\).

### Proof Outline

The proof of Sard's Theorem is non-trivial and involves several steps, typically using techniques from measure theory and differential topology. Here is an outline:

1. **Local Charts**: Cover the manifold \( M \) with a finite number of coordinate charts. This reduces the problem to proving the theorem for smooth maps from \(\mathbb{R}^m \to \(\mathbb{R}^n\).

2. **Critical Points and Values**: Show that the set of critical points of \( f \) is a subset of \( M \) of lower dimension.

3. **Measure Theory**: Use the fact that the image of a set of lower dimension under a smooth map has measure zero in the target space.

4. **Partition of Unity**: Use partitions of unity to piece together the local results into a global one for the entire manifold.

### Conclusion

Sard's Theorem is a cornerstone of differential topology, providing essential insights into the nature of smooth maps and the structure of manifolds. Its implications for the study of critical points, transversality, and the topology of smooth functions make it a powerful tool in both theoretical and applied mathematics.

Sard's Theorem


**ASSISTANT**

Sard's Theorem, named after the American mathematician Arthur Sard, is a foundational result in differential [[topology]] that provides crucial insights into the structure of differentiable mappings between manifolds. This theorem concerns the "size" and properties of critical values of smooth functions, offering a surprisingly powerful tool for understanding how differentiable maps distort spaces.

### Statement of Sard's Theorem

Let $f: M \to N$ be a smooth map between differentiable manifolds $M$ and $N$, where $\dim(M) \geq \dim(N)$. A point $x \in M$ is called a **critical point** of $f$ if the differential $df_x: T_xM \to T_{f(x)}N$ (the linear map between the tangent spaces at $x$ and $f(x)$, respectively) is not surjective. A value $y \in N$ is a **critical value** if there exists a critical point $x \in M$ such that $f(x) = y$; otherwise, $y$ is a **regular value**.

**Sard's Theorem** states that the set of critical values of $f$ has measure zero in $N$. In other words, "most" points in $N$ are regular values for the map $f$.

### Implications and Intuition

The theorem suggests that, despite the potentially infinite complexity of a smooth map's behavior, the "bad set" where this map fails to be locally invertible (due to critical points mapping to critical values) occupies an insignificantly small portion of the target space in terms of measure. This has profound implications:

- **Generic Properties**: It implies that for almost every point in the target space, the pre-image under a smooth map behaves nicely, often resembling a smooth submanifold of the source space. This supports the intuition that "most" situations or configurations one might randomly choose are not pathological.

- **Transversality and Perturbations**: Sard's Theorem underlies many results in transversality, suggesting that small perturbations of a smooth map can avoid creating undesirable intersections or critical points, thus facilitating generic conditions for smoothness and regularity in intersections of manifolds.

### Applications

- **Inverse Function Theorem and Implicit Function Theorem**: Sard's Theorem provides the groundwork for these fundamental results, ensuring that smooth maps are locally invertible away from a set of measure zero.

- **Morse Theory**: In Morse theory, Sard's Theorem guarantees that almost all level sets of a Morse function are smooth manifolds, which is crucial for analyzing the topological structure of the underlying space via critical points of the function.

- **Singularity Theory**: The theorem is instrumental in [[singularity theory]], where it aids in the study of spaces of mappings and the classification of singularities by showing that singular mappings are rare.

### Mathematical Formalization

In more formal terms, consider a smooth map $f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$ and let $C \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ be the set of critical points, where the Jacobian matrix of $f$ at each point of $C$ has rank less than $m$. Sard's Theorem asserts that the image $f(C) \subset \mathbb{R}^m$ has Lebesgue measure zero, which means that for almost every point $y \in \mathbb{R}^m$, the pre-image under $f$ is a set of points where the map $f$ behaves like a submersion, allowing for local inverses and implying regularity of the level sets and fibers over $y$.

### Versions and Generalizations

Sard's Theorem has been extended to various contexts beyond smooth maps between finite-dimensional manifolds, including maps of Sobolev spaces and certain classes of nonsmooth maps. These generalizations maintain the spirit of Sard's result, emphasizing the predominance of regularity in the behavior of mathematical objects under general conditions.
