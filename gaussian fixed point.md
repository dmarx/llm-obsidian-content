Gaussian fixed point


**ASSISTANT**

The Gaussian fixed point is a fundamental concept in the study of phase transitions and [[critical phenomena]] using the renormalization group (RG) approach. It represents a trivial or non-interacting fixed point where the coupling constants vanish. The behavior of systems near the Gaussian fixed point provides insight into the critical properties of non-interacting or weakly interacting theories.

## Overview

### \(\phi^4\) Theory

In the context of \(\phi^4\) [[scalar field theory]], the Gaussian fixed point is analyzed within the Lagrangian density:

$$
\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2} (\partial_\mu \phi)(\partial^\mu \phi) + \frac{1}{2} r \phi^2 + \frac{u}{4!} \phi^4
$$

Here, \(r\) and \(u\) are parameters representing the mass term and the coupling constant of the \(\phi^4\) interaction, respectively.

### Renormalization Group and Fixed Points

In the RG framework, we study how the parameters of the theory evolve with changes in the energy scale \(\mu\). The beta functions describe the flow of these parameters:

$$
\beta_r(r, u) = \mu \frac{d r}{d \mu}, \quad \beta_u(u) = \mu \frac{d u}{d \mu}
$$

A fixed point \((r^*, u^*)\) is defined by the conditions:

$$
\beta_r(r^*, u^*) = 0, \quad \beta_u(u^*) = 0
$$

### Gaussian Fixed Point

The Gaussian fixed point corresponds to the values \(r^* = 0\) and \(u^* = 0\). It represents the non-interacting theory, where the \(\phi^4\) interaction term is absent.

## Properties and Stability

### Beta Functions

To understand the behavior near the Gaussian fixed point, we consider the beta functions for \(r\) and \(u\). To leading order, these are:

$$
\beta_r(r, u) = 2r + O(u)
$$

$$
\beta_u(u) = -\epsilon u + \frac{3(N+8)}{16\pi^2} u^2 + O(u^3)
$$

where \(d = 4 - \epsilon\) and \(N\) is the number of components of the scalar field \(\phi\).

### Stability Analysis

The stability of the Gaussian fixed point is determined by the sign of the eigenvalues of the stability matrix. Near the Gaussian fixed point, the stability matrix is:

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
2 & 0 \\
0 & -\epsilon
\end{pmatrix}
$$

The eigenvalues are \(2\) and \(-\epsilon\). This indicates:
- \(r\) is a relevant parameter near \(d = 4\), as its eigenvalue is positive.
- \(u\) is relevant for \(\epsilon > 0\) (i.e., in dimensions \(d < 4\)) because its eigenvalue is negative, indicating instability.

Thus, in dimensions \(d < 4\), the Gaussian fixed point is unstable due to the relevance of the interaction term.

## Critical Behavior Near the Gaussian Fixed Point

### Mean Field Theory

The Gaussian fixed point corresponds to [[mean field theory]], which provides a good approximation in high dimensions (above the upper critical dimension \(d = 4\)). Near the Gaussian fixed point, the critical exponents take their mean-field values:
- \(\alpha = 0\)
- \(\beta = \frac{1}{2}\)
- \(\gamma = 1\)
- \(\delta = 3\)
- \(\nu = \frac{1}{2}\)
- \(\eta = 0\)

### Deviations from Mean Field Theory

Below the upper critical dimension (\(d < 4\)), fluctuations become important, and the Gaussian fixed point is no longer sufficient to describe the critical behavior. The system flows towards the Wilson-Fisher fixed point, where the critical exponents deviate from their mean-field values.

## Applications

### Landau-Ginzburg Theory

The Gaussian fixed point is the starting point for the Landau-Ginzburg theory of phase transitions. In this theory, one begins with the Gaussian approximation and then includes interactions perturbatively.

### Quantum Field Theory

In quantum field theory, the Gaussian fixed point corresponds to free field theories, where the fields do not interact. Understanding the Gaussian fixed point is essential for studying perturbative expansions and renormalization.

### Statistical Mechanics

In statistical mechanics, the Gaussian fixed point describes systems where [[mean field theory]] is valid, such as the behavior of magnets above their upper critical dimension.
