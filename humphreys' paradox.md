Humphreys' Paradox


**ASSISTANT**

Humphreys' Paradox, introduced by Paul Humphreys in his 1985 paper "Why Propensities Cannot Be Probabilities," challenges the application of propensity interpretations of probability, particularly in single-case scenarios. The paradox highlights a conflict between how probabilities are supposed to guide rational beliefs and how propensities are used to explain physical probabilities. Here’s a detailed exploration of Humphreys' Paradox:

### The Paradox Explained

Humphreys' Paradox arises from considering the application of the Principal Principle in situations involving single-case propensities. According to the Principal Principle, if the objective chance of an event \(A\) is known to be \(x\), then a rational agent should set their subjective probability (credence) for \(A\) to \(x\). 

However, the paradox highlights a problem when we try to apply this principle to propensities:

1. **Propensity Interpretation**: Propensities are conceived as tendencies or dispositions of physical systems to produce certain outcomes. They are often used to interpret single-case probabilities in terms of physical properties of systems.

2. **Single-Case Scenario**: Consider a single event where the propensity interpretation assigns a probability of \(x\) to the event \(A\) occurring. According to the Principal Principle, an agent who knows this propensity should set their credence for \(A\) to \(x\).

### The Paradox

Humphreys' Paradox can be outlined as follows:

1. **Propensity and Evidence**: If propensities are considered objective chances, then knowing the propensity should influence an agent's subjective probability. However, propensities are often derived from physical conditions and experimental setups that may themselves be uncertain or probabilistic.

2. **Iterative Application**: Suppose we have a propensity \(P(A) = x\) and this propensity is itself uncertain. The propensity interpretation would then require considering the propensity of the propensity, leading to an infinite regress.

3. **Circularity and Regress**: The process of setting credences based on propensities involves circular reasoning. The agent must base their belief on a propensity, which in turn depends on another propensity, ad infinitum. This creates a problem where it is unclear how to justify any particular credence.

### Key Points

- **Objective Chances vs. Rational Credence**: The paradox shows a tension between objective propensities and the subjective credences they are supposed to inform. If propensities are not well-defined or are part of an infinite regress, they cannot effectively guide rational belief.

- **Implications for Propensity Theories**: Humphreys' Paradox challenges the use of propensities as probabilities, especially in single-case interpretations. It suggests that propensity theories might not be adequate for providing a coherent account of objective chances.

### Response and Discussion

The paradox has led to several responses and ongoing discussions in the philosophy of probability:

1. **Refinement of Propensity Theories**: Some philosophers have attempted to refine propensity theories to avoid the issues highlighted by Humphreys. This includes developing more sophisticated models that account for the contextual dependencies of propensities.

2. **Alternative Interpretations**: The paradox has also spurred interest in alternative interpretations of probability, such as frequency, subjective, and objective Bayesian interpretations, which avoid the problems associated with single-case propensities.

3. **Conceptual Clarification**: The paradox has prompted deeper analysis and clarification of the concepts of probability, chance, and propensity, leading to more precise definitions and philosophical frameworks.

### Conclusion

Humphreys' Paradox raises important questions about the coherence of propensity interpretations of probability, especially in single-case scenarios. It challenges the straightforward application of the Principal Principle when dealing with propensities, highlighting the need for careful consideration of how objective chances and subjective credences are related. The paradox continues to be a significant point of discussion and analysis in the philosophy of probability.
