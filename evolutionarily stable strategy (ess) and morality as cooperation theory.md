### Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS) and Morality as Cooperation Theory

The concept of an **Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS)** from evolutionary game theory provides a rigorous framework for understanding the stability of cooperative behaviors in populations. This concept can be closely related to the **Morality as Cooperation (MAC)** theory, which posits that morality comprises a set of evolved solutions to recurring problems of cooperation in human social life. Here’s how ESS and MAC intersect and reinforce each other:

### Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS)

An **ESS** is a strategy which, if adopted by a population, cannot be invaded by any alternative strategy. It is a refinement of the Nash Equilibrium for dynamic, evolutionary contexts. Formally, a strategy \(S\) is an ESS if:

1. **Fitness Criterion**: For all alternative strategies \(S'\),
   $$
   f(S, S) > f(S', S)
   $$
   where \( f(S, S) \) is the fitness of individuals using strategy \(S\) when interacting with others using strategy \(S\).

2. **Equilibrium and Resistance to Invasion**: If \( f(S, S) = f(S', S) \), then:
   $$
   f(S, S') > f(S', S')
   $$
   This means that even if the fitness of \(S\) and \(S'\) are equal when interacting with \(S\), \(S\) must outperform \(S'\) when interacting with \(S'\).

### Morality as Cooperation (MAC) Theory

**MAC** theory proposes that human morality evolved as a collection of solutions to cooperation problems. These problems are recurrent in human social life and are crucial for the survival and reproduction of individuals within groups. The primary [[types of cooperation]] identified in MAC include:

1. **Family Values**: Promoting the well-being of kin.
2. **Group Loyalty**: Enhancing group cohesion.
3. **Reciprocity**: Facilitating mutually beneficial exchanges.
4. **Heroism**: Valuing bravery that protects the group.
5. **Deference**: Respecting authority and social hierarchies.
6. **Fairness**: Ensuring equitable treatment.
7. **Property Rights**: Respecting ownership and territorial boundaries.

### Integrating ESS with MAC

#### Kin Selection and ESS
- **Family Values**: Behaviors that promote the well-being of kin can be modeled as an ESS. Kin selection posits that strategies promoting inclusive fitness (enhancing the survival of genetically related individuals) can become evolutionarily stable. For instance, altruistic behaviors towards relatives are maintained in a population because they increase the overall genetic fitness.

$$
\text{Hamilton's Rule: } rB > C
$$
where \( r \) is the coefficient of relatedness, \( B \) is the benefit to the recipient, and \( C \) is the cost to the altruist.

#### Direct Reciprocity and ESS
- **Reciprocity**: The strategy of direct reciprocity can also be framed as an ESS. The well-known "Tit-for-Tat" strategy, where individuals start by cooperating and then replicate their partner's previous action, is a classic example.

$$
\text{Payoff: } \pi_i = R \text{ (if both cooperate) } > S \text{ (if only one cooperates)}
$$

#### Indirect Reciprocity and ESS
- **Reputation-based Indirect Reciprocity**: Strategies based on indirect reciprocity, where individuals help others to build a reputation for being cooperative, can stabilize cooperation in larger groups. An individual’s reputation serves as a crucial factor influencing their fitness.

$$
\pi_i = \sum_{j} w_{ij} (b_{ij} - c_{ij})
$$
where \( w_{ij} \) is the weight given by \( j \) to \( i \) based on reputation.

#### Group Selection and ESS
- **Group Loyalty and Heroism**: Group selection can lead to the evolution of strategies where individuals exhibit loyalty and heroism. Groups with higher levels of cooperation can outcompete less cooperative groups.

$$
\Delta z = \Delta z_{w} + \Delta z_{b}
$$
where \( \Delta z \) is the change in the frequency of a trait, \( \Delta z_{w} \) is the within-group selection component, and \( \Delta z_{b} \) is the between-group selection component.

#### Fairness and ESS
- **Fairness**: Fair distribution of resources can be evolutionarily stable if individuals who share fairly are more likely to be chosen as partners in cooperative ventures.

$$
\text{Fair Sharing Payoff: } \pi_i = \frac{R}{N}
$$
where \( R \) is the total resource and \( N \) is the number of individuals sharing the resource.

#### Property Rights and ESS
- **Property Rights**: Respect for property can become an ESS if individuals who respect others' property are more likely to have their own property respected, leading to mutual benefits.

### Conclusion

By integrating ESS into MAC, we can see how stable strategies for cooperation evolve and persist in human populations. ESS provides the mathematical and theoretical foundation to explain why certain cooperative behaviors, as identified by MAC, are resilient to invasion by non-cooperative strategies. This synthesis of evolutionary game theory and the morality as cooperation framework offers a comprehensive understanding of the evolution and stability of moral behaviors in human societies.
