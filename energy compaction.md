Energy Compaction


**ASSISTANT**

Energy compaction refers to the property of a transform to concentrate most of the signal's energy in a few coefficients. This is particularly important in applications like data compression, where the goal is to represent the original data with the least amount of information without significant loss in quality. The [[Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)]] and the [[Fourier Transform]] are commonly used transforms that exhibit strong energy compaction properties.

### Definition

Energy compaction is formally described by how well a transform \( T \) can concentrate the energy \( E \) of a signal \( x \) into a few transform coefficients. Mathematically, if \( T \) is the transform operator, the energy of the original signal \( x \) is:

$$
E_x = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} |x[n]|^2
$$

After applying the transform \( T \), the signal is represented by coefficients \( X[k] \):

$$
X[k] = T \{ x[n] \}
$$

The energy of the transformed signal is:

$$
E_X = \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} |X[k]|^2
$$

For a good energy compaction property, \( E_X \) should be concentrated in a few coefficients \( X[k] \).

### Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)

The DCT is particularly effective in energy compaction, which is why it is widely used in image and audio compression. In the context of the DCT, the property can be expressed as follows:

1. **Concentration of Energy**: Most of the signal's energy is concentrated in the low-frequency components. For a typical signal, the higher frequency components (higher \( k \) values) tend to be very small.
2. **Compression Efficiency**: By quantizing and encoding only the few significant low-frequency DCT coefficients, we can achieve high compression ratios with minimal perceptual loss.

### Example in Image Compression (JPEG)

Consider an 8x8 block of an image. The DCT-II is applied to each block, transforming the spatial domain pixel values into frequency domain coefficients. In a typical image, many of these coefficients will be near zero or very small. 

For instance, suppose we have the following 8x8 block of pixel values:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
52 & 55 & 61 & 66 & 70 & 61 & 64 & 73 \\
63 & 59 & 66 & 90 & 109 & 85 & 69 & 72 \\
62 & 59 & 68 & 104 & 126 & 88 & 68 & 68 \\
63 & 58 & 71 & 122 & 154 & 106 & 70 & 69 \\
67 & 61 & 68 & 104 & 126 & 88 & 68 & 70 \\
79 & 65 & 60 & 70 & 77 & 68 & 58 & 75 \\
85 & 71 & 64 & 59 & 55 & 61 & 65 & 83 \\
87 & 79 & 69 & 68 & 65 & 76 & 78 & 94
\end{bmatrix}
$$

After applying the DCT, we might get the following coefficients:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
550 & -30 &  20 & -10 &   0 &  5 &  0 &  0 \\
-20 & -30 &   0 &   0 &   0 &  0 &  0 &  0 \\
 15 &  10 &   0 &   0 &   0 &  0 &  0 &  0 \\
-10 &   0 &   0 &   0 &   0 &  0 &  0 &  0 \\
  0 &   0 &   0 &   0 &   0 &  0 &  0 &  0 \\
  5 &   0 &   0 &   0 &   0 &  0 &  0 &  0 \\
  0 &   0 &   0 &   0 &   0 &  0 &  0 &  0 \\
  0 &   0 &   0 &   0 &   0 &  0 &  0 &  0
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Here, most of the significant energy is concentrated in the top-left corner of the matrix, corresponding to low-frequency components. By encoding only these significant coefficients and ignoring the small ones, we achieve compression.

### Mathematical Analysis

Let \( x[n] \) be the original signal and \( X[k] \) be its DCT coefficients. The Parsevalâ€™s theorem assures that the total energy remains the same in both domains:

$$
\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} |x[n]|^2 = \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} |X[k]|^2
$$

A good energy compaction means that \( \sum_{k \in K} |X[k]|^2 \approx \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} |X[k]|^2 \), where \( K \) is a small subset of the total set of coefficients. This property allows efficient compression by representing the signal with a smaller number of coefficients.

### Applications

- **JPEG Image Compression**: Uses DCT to transform image blocks, resulting in a high energy compaction that allows significant compression ratios with minimal loss in visual quality.
- **Audio Compression**: Formats like MP3 and AAC use the Modified Discrete Cosine Transform (MDCT) for high-efficiency compression.
- **Video Compression**: Standards like MPEG and H.264 use the DCT for compressing video frames.
