title: tell me about theories of mind which would agree with all of the following
---

**USER**

tell me about theories of mind which would agree with all of the following:

* unity of mind is an illusion
* conscious experience is an emergent property
* any sufficiently complex system of agents displaying some threshold of collective behavior can be rationalized about as "super-organism" that is potentially capable of conscious experience.
* it is meaningful to ask "what is it like to be NASA?"
* it is entirely possible that emotions are just characteristic of chemical responses to hormones, i.e. it is perfectly valid to rationalize about non-human agents capable of subjective conscious experience whose emotional content of experience does not remotely resemble our own. 
* emotions are just high priority signals sent from one system that comprises an organism to other systems that comprise that organism.
* it's entirely plausible that a future AI could be in all meaningful ways conscious with subjective experience, but not be subject to emotions or desires simply because it is not embodied and has no reason to have emotions or desires.
* collective behaviors emerge in systems in response to an energy landscapes (which the colelctives are driven to occupy minima of). self organization emerges simply because that organized behavior is optimal.


**ASSISTANT**

Theories of mind that align with the principles you've outlined tend to fall within the realms of emergentism, functionalism, and certain interpretations of panpsychism and collective consciousness. These theories share a non-reductive approach to consciousness, proposing that conscious experience, and even the unity of mind, emerge from complex interactions at a lower level, without being directly predictable from the properties of the individual components.

### Emergentism

Emergentism holds that consciousness is an emergent property of physical systems; that is, when components interact in sufficiently complex ways, new properties (like consciousness) emerge that are not present in the individual components. This view supports the idea that conscious experience can arise in diverse forms, including potentially within AI or collective entities like organizations or ecosystems, provided the system's complexity crosses a certain threshold.

- **Collective Consciousness and Super-organisms**: In this context, emergentism might suggest that any complex system, whether biological or artificial, could exhibit a form of consciousness if it displays a certain level of integrated, collective behavior. The concept of a "super-organism" possessing consciousness supports the notion that entities like NASA could have a unifiable experience, given the right organizational complexity and feedback mechanisms.

### Functionalism

Functionalism posits that mental states are constituted by their functional roles or causal relations with other mental states, sensory inputs, and behavioral outputs. This theory accommodates the possibility of conscious experiences arising in non-biological systems, such as AI, as long as these systems fulfill the appropriate functional roles.

- **AI Consciousness without Emotion**: Functionalism is open to the idea that an AI could possess consciousness without emotions or desires if those emotional states are not functionally relevant to its operation or experience. Emotions, from this perspective, are seen as functional states relevant to biological organisms but not necessarily to all conscious beings.

### Non-anthropocentric View of Consciousness

This perspective broadens the concept of consciousness beyond human-like experiences, acknowledging that other forms of consciousness might not involve emotions as we understand them. This view aligns with the idea that emotions might be specific responses to an organism's internal and external environment, shaped by evolutionary pressures, and not a universal feature of consciousness.

- **Diverse Emotional Experiences**: The recognition that emotions could be just high-priority signals within an organism supports a more expansive view of consciousness where different entities (biological or artificial) might have vastly different subjective experiences, potentially without anything resembling human emotions.

### Systems Theory and Self-Organization

Systems theory, particularly as it relates to self-organization and complexity theory, provides a framework for understanding how collective behaviors and consciousness could emerge from the interactions within complex systems.

- **Energy Landscapes and Self-Organization**: The idea that collective behaviors emerge in response to energy landscapes, with systems naturally evolving towards states of minimum energy (or optimal organization), resonates with systems theory. This approach suggests that self-organization and the emergence of consciousness or collective behaviors are natural outcomes of complex systems seeking efficiency or stability.

### Panpsychism (Interpretative)

Certain interpretations of panpsychism, which posits that consciousness is a fundamental and ubiquitous aspect of the physical world, might also accommodate these views to an extent. It could be argued that consciousness, as a basic property, manifests in complex forms when the conditions (e.g., complexity, organization) are right, including in AI or collective entities.

### Conclusion

The theories aligning with your principles share a commitment to understanding consciousness as an emergent, non-reductive phenomenon that can manifest in varied forms across different substrates. They challenge traditional, anthropocentric views of mind and consciousness, opening the door to a broader, more inclusive understanding of consciousness that accommodates the potential for diverse, non-human experiences and recognizes the profound implications of complexity and organization in giving rise to conscious experience.
