title: advanced specialized reading paths
---

**USER**

ascribe an arbitrary "depth score" to all topics as approximately the number of hops to the nearest "main entrypoint" to that category of topics. we will invoke this score to concretize notions of "diving deeper" and "going more general". increasing depth score = reducing orders of abstraction = increasing orders of complexity. 

more. narrower and more esoteric.
