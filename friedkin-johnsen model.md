Friedkin-Johnsen Model


**ASSISTANT**

The Friedkin-Johnsen model is a well-known framework in the [[study of opinion dynamics within social networks]]. Unlike models that assume complete flexibility in updating opinions, the Friedkin-Johnsen model incorporates the idea that individuals have a certain level of stubbornness, retaining some influence from their initial opinions throughout the process of opinion formation.

### Key Concepts

1. **Initial Opinions**: Each individual has an initial opinion that continues to influence their current opinion.
2. **Social Influence**: Individuals update their opinions based on the opinions of their neighbors.
3. **Stubbornness**: Individuals have a degree of resistance to change, which reflects the weight they place on their initial opinions.

### Model Description

#### Setup

- **Agents**: Let there be \( n \) agents, each with an initial opinion \( x_i(0) \in [0, 1] \), where \( i = 1, 2, \ldots, n \).
- **Adjacency Matrix**: \( A = [a_{ij}] \) where \( a_{ij} \) represents the influence weight of agent \( j \) on agent \( i \). The matrix \( A \) is typically row-stochastic, meaning each row sums to 1.
- **Stubbornness**: Each agent \( i \) has a stubbornness parameter \( \alpha_i \in [0, 1] \), indicating the weight given to their initial opinion.

#### Update Rule

At each discrete time step \( t \), the opinion of agent \( i \) is updated according to:
$$
x_i(t+1) = \alpha_i x_i(0) + (1 - \alpha_i) \sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij} x_j(t)
$$
where \( x_i(0) \) is the initial opinion of agent \( i \).

In matrix form, the update rule for the entire network can be written as:
$$
\mathbf{x}(t+1) = \mathbf{\alpha} \circ \mathbf{x}(0) + (I - D_{\alpha}) A \mathbf{x}(t)
$$
where:
- \( \mathbf{x}(t) = [x_1(t), x_2(t), \ldots, x_n(t)]^T \) is the opinion vector at time \( t \).
- \( \mathbf{\alpha} = [\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \ldots, \alpha_n]^T \) is the vector of stubbornness parameters.
- \( D_{\alpha} \) is the diagonal matrix with \( \alpha_i \) on the diagonal.
- \( \circ \) denotes the element-wise (Hadamard) product.

### Dynamics and Phenomena

1. **Convergence**: The opinions \( \mathbf{x}(t) \) converge to a steady state \( \mathbf{x}^* \) as \( t \to \infty \):
   $$
   \mathbf{x}^* = (I - (I - D_{\alpha}) A)^{-1} \mathbf{\alpha} \circ \mathbf{x}(0)
   $$
   This steady state is influenced by the initial opinions and the structure of the social network.

2. **Influence of Stubbornness**: Higher values of \( \alpha_i \) mean that agent \( i \) is more stubborn, retaining more influence from their initial opinion. When \( \alpha_i = 1 \), the agent's opinion never changes.

3. **Network Structure Impact**: The topology of the network, encoded in the adjacency matrix \( A \), significantly affects the convergence behavior and the final opinion distribution.

### Example

Consider a simple network of three agents with the following parameters:
- Initial opinions: \( \mathbf{x}(0) = [0.2, 0.5, 0.8] \)
- Stubbornness: \( \alpha = [0.6, 0.3, 0.1] \)
- Adjacency matrix:
  $$
  A = \begin{bmatrix}
  0.5 & 0.5 & 0 \\
  0.3 & 0.4 & 0.3 \\
  0 & 0.5 & 0.5
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$

Using the update rule:
$$
x_1(t+1) = 0.6 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot (0.5x_1(t) + 0.5x_2(t))
$$
$$
x_2(t+1) = 0.3 \cdot 0.5 + 0.7 \cdot (0.3x_1(t) + 0.4x_2(t) + 0.3x_3(t))
$$
$$
x_3(t+1) = 0.1 \cdot 0.8 + 0.9 \cdot (0.5x_2(t) + 0.5x_3(t))
$$

Iterating these updates will show the evolution of opinions over time and their eventual convergence to a steady state.

### Applications

1. **Political Science**: Analyzing how individuals with pre-existing political beliefs are influenced by social interactions.
2. **Marketing**: Understanding how initial consumer preferences affect the spread of product opinions.
3. **Public Opinion**: Studying how stubbornness in initial opinions affects consensus formation in public debates.

### Conclusion

The Friedkin-Johnsen model provides a nuanced understanding of opinion dynamics by incorporating the role of initial opinions and individual stubbornness. This makes it particularly suitable for analyzing scenarios where initial beliefs have a lasting impact on opinion evolution. The model's ability to capture the interplay between social influence and personal bias offers valuable insights into the mechanisms driving consensus, polarization, and opinion fragmentation in social networks.
