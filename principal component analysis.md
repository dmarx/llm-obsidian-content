Principal Component Analysis


**ASSISTANT**

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. This transformation is defined in such a way that the first principal component has the largest possible variance (that is, accounts for as much of the variability in the data as possible), and each succeeding component in turn has the highest variance possible under the constraint that it is orthogonal to the preceding components. The resulting vectors are an uncorrelated orthogonal [[basis]] set. PCA is sensitive to the relative scaling of the original variables.

### Key Concepts and Steps

1. **Standardization**: Often, the initial step in PCA is to standardize the data so that each feature contributes equally to the analysis. This involves subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation for each value of each variable.

2. **Covariance Matrix Computation**: The next step is to compute the covariance matrix of the data. The covariance matrix expresses the correlation between the different variables in the dataset.

3. **Eigenvalue Decomposition**: PCA involves decomposing the covariance matrix into its [[eigenvalues]] and eigenvectors. The eigenvectors of the covariance matrix represent the directions (or principal components) of the data that maximize the variance of the data, while the [[eigenvalues]] represent the magnitude of these directions.

4. **Selection of Principal Components**: The principal components are ranked according to their [[eigenvalues]], with the first principal component corresponding to the direction of greatest variance, the second principal component corresponding to the direction of the second greatest variance, and so on. The number of principal components kept for further analysis is often chosen based on the cumulative explained variance, which should ideally be as high as possible (commonly set to a threshold like 95%).

5. **Transformation to New Space**: Finally, the original data is projected onto the principal components (the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix) to transform it into the new space. This results in a set of orthogonal vectors over which the original data is now expressed.

### Applications

- **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA is widely used for [[dimensionality reduction]] in data preprocessing for machine learning models when the number of input features (variables) is too high. It helps to avoid the curse of dimensionality and reduce computational cost.

- **Visualization**: PCA is used for visualizing high-dimensional data by reducing it to 2D or 3D.

- **Noise Reduction**: By keeping only the most significant principal components and ignoring the ones with lower variance, which are likely to correspond to noise, PCA can help in filtering noise from the data.

- **Feature Extraction and Engineering**: PCA can be used to derive new features that are a linear combination of the original features but with better properties, such as being uncorrelated and capturing the essence of the data.

Despite its wide range of applications, PCA has limitations, such as assuming linearity, being sensitive to the scale of the data, and not necessarily capturing the intrinsic structure of the data if the relationships are nonlinear. Advanced techniques like kernel PCA or autoencoders may be used to overcome some of these limitations, especially for complex or non-linear datasets.
