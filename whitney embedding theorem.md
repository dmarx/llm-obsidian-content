Whitney Embedding Theorem


**ASSISTANT**

The **Whitney Embedding Theorem** is a fundamental result in differential topology, named after the American mathematician Hassler Whitney. It asserts that any smooth \(n\)-dimensional manifold can be embedded into a Euclidean space of sufficiently high dimension. This theorem provides a way to represent abstract manifolds concretely in Euclidean space, preserving their differentiable structure.

### Statement of the Whitney Embedding Theorem

The Whitney [[embedding]] theorem can be stated as follows:

1. **Embedding Theorem**: Any smooth \(n\)-dimensional manifold \(M\) can be embedded into \(\mathbb{R}^{2n}\). This means there exists a smooth injective map \(f: M \to \mathbb{R}^{2n}\) such that \(f\) is a homeomorphism onto its image \(f(M) \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{2n}\).

2. **Stronger Version**: If \(M\) is compact, then \(M\) can be embedded into \(\mathbb{R}^{2n-1}\).

### Key Concepts

1. **Smooth Manifold**: A manifold \(M\) is a topological space that locally resembles Euclidean space and has a smooth (infinitely differentiable) structure.
2. **Embedding**: A map \(f: M \to \mathbb{R}^N\) is an [[embedding]] if it is an injective immersion (smooth and its derivative is injective everywhere) and a homeomorphism onto its image. Essentially, this means \(f\) preserves the manifold's topology and differentiable structure.
3. **Euclidean Space**: \(\mathbb{R}^N\) is the \(N\)-dimensional Euclidean space with the standard topology and differentiable structure.

### Implications

The Whitney [[embedding]] theorem provides a concrete way to visualize and analyze smooth manifolds by representing them as submanifolds of Euclidean space. This [[embedding]] allows mathematicians and physicists to apply techniques and intuition from Euclidean geometry to study more abstract manifolds.

### Example

Consider a 2-dimensional torus \(T^2\), which can be represented as the product of two circles, \(S^1 \times S^1\). According to the Whitney [[embedding]] theorem, \(T^2\) can be embedded into \(\mathbb{R}^4\). In fact, it is possible to embed the torus in \(\mathbb{R}^3\) as a surface of revolution, though this requires specific embeddings that do not overlap.

### Applications

1. **Differential Topology**: The Whitney [[embedding]] theorem is foundational in differential topology, providing a way to study abstract manifolds using the concrete geometry of Euclidean space.
2. **Theoretical Physics**: Embeddings are used in general relativity to represent curved spacetime manifolds within higher-dimensional Euclidean spaces.
3. **Computer Graphics and Visualization**: The theorem underpins techniques for visualizing higher-dimensional objects by [[embedding]] them in 3-dimensional space.
4. **Robotics and Control Theory**: Embeddings help in understanding the configuration spaces of robotic systems, which are often smooth manifolds.

### Formal Proof Outline

The proof of the Whitney [[embedding]] theorem is non-trivial and involves several advanced concepts from differential topology, including transversality and Sard's theorem. Here is a very high-level outline of the approach:

1. **Local Charts**: Use the fact that a smooth manifold \(M\) can be covered by a finite number of coordinate charts, each mapping a neighborhood in \(M\) to \(\mathbb{R}^n\).

2. **Local Embeddings**: Construct local embeddings for each chart. Since each chart maps to \(\mathbb{R}^n\), locally [[embedding]] into \(\mathbb{R}^{2n}\) can be done by extending the dimension.

3. **Global Embedding**: Use a [[partition of unity]] to glue these local embeddings together into a global [[embedding]] that is smooth.

4. **Transversality**: Apply the [[transversality theorem]] to show that the resulting map can be perturbed to an [[embedding]]. Essentially, this involves ensuring that the map is both injective and its differential is injective everywhere.

### Conclusion

The Whitney [[embedding]] theorem is a cornerstone of differential topology, showing that any smooth \(n\)-dimensional manifold can be embedded into \(\mathbb{R}^{2n}\). This result not only provides a powerful tool for visualizing and analyzing manifolds but also bridges the gap between abstract mathematical theory and concrete geometric intuition.
