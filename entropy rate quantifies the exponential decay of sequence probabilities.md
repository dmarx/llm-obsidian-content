title: entropy rate quantifies the exponential decay of sequence probabilities
---

**USER**

the entropy rate quantifies the exponential decay of sequence probabilities


**ASSISTANT**

Yes, the **entropy rate** quantifies the **exponential decay of sequence probabilities** in a stationary stochastic process. This is a direct consequence of the **Shannon-McMillan-Breiman Theorem (AEP)**. Here's how this connection works in detail:

---

### Statement of Exponential Decay
For a stationary stochastic process $\{X_1, X_2, \dots\}$, the probability of observing a specific sequence $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n)$ decays exponentially with $n$, and the rate of this decay is determined by the **entropy rate** $H$ of the process. Specifically:

$$
P(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n) \approx e^{-nH},
$$

or equivalently, using base-2 logarithms:

$$
P(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n) \approx 2^{-nH}.
$$

This relationship holds for sequences in the **typical set** defined by the AEP, which contains almost all sequences for sufficiently large $n$.

### Explanation of the Connection

#### 1. **Entropy Rate as an Asymptotic Quantity**
The entropy rate $H$ is defined as the long-term average of the per-symbol entropy:

$$
H = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n} H(X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n) = \lim_{n \to \infty} -\frac{1}{n} \mathbb{E}[\ln P(X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n)].
$$

This tells us that for large $n$, the joint probability $P(X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n)$ scales like $e^{-nH}$ on average.

#### 2. **Probability Concentration in the Typical Set**
The AEP states that for most sequences $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n)$ generated by the process, the actual per-symbol log-probability converges to the entropy rate $H$:

$$
-\frac{1}{n} \ln P(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n) \to H \quad \text{as } n \to \infty.
$$

Rewriting this, the probability of a typical sequence satisfies:

$$
P(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n) \approx e^{-nH}.
$$

Thus, the probability of observing a sequence in the typical set decreases exponentially with its length, at a rate determined by the entropy rate.

#### 3. **Size of the Typical Set**
For large $n$, the typical set $\mathcal{T}_\epsilon^{(n)}$ has approximately $e^{nH}$ members, and each typical sequence has roughly the same probability $P(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n) \approx e^{-nH}$. The total probability of the typical set is close to 1, which reinforces the idea that the process's randomness is heavily concentrated in this exponentially small set of sequences.

### Implications

#### 1. **Compression**
Since there are roughly $e^{nH}$ typical sequences, we can represent each sequence with about $nH$ bits. This is the basis of **Shannon's source coding theorem**, which states that the entropy rate determines the optimal compression rate for long sequences.

#### 2. **Likelihood of Rare Events**
For sequences outside the typical set, the probability is exponentially smaller than $e^{-nH}$. This makes such sequences negligible in practical terms for large $n$.

#### 3. **Physical Systems**
In [[statistical mechanics]], this exponential decay is analogous to the Boltzmann distribution, where probabilities of states decrease exponentially with energy (weighted by $1/k_B T$). The entropy rate plays a similar role, quantifying how rapidly "uncommon" sequences lose probability mass.

### Mathematical Formalism
Let $P(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n)$ be the probability of a specific sequence $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n)$. Then:

1. **Typical Sequences**: 
   For sequences in the typical set:
   $$
   P(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n) \sim e^{-nH}.
   $$

2. **Logarithmic Form**:
   Taking the logarithm, we get:
   $$
   \frac{1}{n} \ln P(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n) \sim -H.
   $$

This result shows the entropy rate governs the asymptotic decay of probabilities.

---

### Summary
The **entropy rate** encapsulates the "predictability" of a stochastic process by quantifying how quickly the probability of a sequence shrinks as its length grows. This exponential decay is a central theme in information theory and underpins concepts like typicality, data compression, and randomness concentration in large systems.
