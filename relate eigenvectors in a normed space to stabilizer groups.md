title: relate eigenvectors in a normed space to stabilizer groups

relate eigenvectors in a normed space to stabilizer groups


**ASSISTANT**

Eigenvectors in a normed space and stabilizer groups are concepts that arise from different areas of mathematics but can be related through the notion of symmetry and invariance under transformation. Let's explore how eigenvectors in linear algebra relate to the concept of stabilizer groups in group theory, particularly within the context of linear transformations and normed vector spaces.

### Eigenvectors and Linear Transformations

An **eigenvector** of a linear transformation \(T\) from a vector space \(V\) to itself is a non-zero vector \(v \in V\) that satisfies the equation:

\[ T(v) = \lambda v \]

where \(\lambda\) is a scalar known as the eigenvalue associated with \(v\). This definition implies that applying the transformation \(T\) to the eigenvector \(v\) simply scales \(v\) by the factor \(\lambda\), without changing its direction in the vector space.

### Stabilizer Groups and Invariance

A **stabilizer group** of an element \(x\) under the action of a group \(G\) consists of all elements in \(G\) that leave \(x\) unchanged. In the context of a vector space with a group of linear transformations acting on it, the stabilizer group of a vector \(v\) would consist of all transformations in \(G\) that fix \(v\), meaning that applying any transformation \(g\) in the stabilizer group to \(v\) leaves \(v\) invariant (up to scaling, in the case of eigenvectors).

### Connecting Eigenvectors to Stabilizer Groups

When considering a normed space (a vector space equipped with a norm) and linear transformations acting on it, eigenvectors represent a specific form of symmetry: they are invariant under the linear transformation up to a scalar factor. The concept of a stabilizer group can be extended to this setting by considering the group of all linear transformations that leave a set of eigenvectors invariant.

- **Eigenvectors as Symmetries**: An eigenvector \(v\) of a linear transformation \(T\) exhibits a symmetry in that \(T\) does not alter the direction of \(v\), only its magnitude. This is a symmetry under the transformation \(T\), analogous to how an object might be invariant under physical rotations or translations.

- **Stabilizer Group of an Eigenvector**: For an eigenvector \(v\), we can define its stabilizer group under a group \(G\) of linear transformations as the set of all transformations in \(G\) that satisfy \(T(v) = \lambda v\) for some scalar \(\lambda\). This group would include at least the transformation \(T\) itself and possibly others if they share the same eigenvector \(v\).

- **Normed Spaces and Eigenvectors**: In a normed space, the norm provides a measure of the "size" or "length" of vectors. The significance of eigenvectors in such a space is that, while their direction is preserved under the associated linear transformation, their norm can be scaled by the eigenvalue \(\lambda\). This highlights a form of geometric symmetry specific to the structure of the space and the nature of the linear transformation.

### Conclusion

Relating eigenvectors in a normed space to stabilizer groups bridges the concept of symmetry in linear algebra with that in group theory. Eigenvectors represent vectors that are invariant under specific linear transformations (up to scaling), mirroring the idea of stabilizer groups as collections of transformations that preserve certain elements or structures. This relationship underscores the unifying theme of symmetry and invariance across different areas of mathematics, illuminating the deep structures that govern both abstract spaces and physical realities.
