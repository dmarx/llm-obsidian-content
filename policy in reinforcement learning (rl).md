## Policy in Reinforcement Learning (RL)

### Overview

In the context of [[reinforcement learning]] (RL), a **policy** is a strategy that defines the behavior of an agent by mapping states to actions. The policy determines how the agent selects actions based on the current state to maximize cumulative rewards over time. Policies can be deterministic or stochastic and are central to the learning process in RL.

### Formal Definition

A policy \(\pi\) in RL can be formally defined as a mapping from states to actions. Depending on whether the policy is deterministic or stochastic, it can be expressed in different ways:

1. **Deterministic Policy**: Maps each state to a specific action.
2. **Stochastic Policy**: Maps each state to a probability distribution over actions.

### Components of a Policy

#### 1. State Space (\(S\))

The state space \(S\) is the set of all possible states \(s \in S\) that describe the environment at any given time.

#### 2. Action Space (\(A\))

The action space \(A\) is the set of all possible actions \(a \in A\) that the agent can take.

### Types of Policies

#### 1. Deterministic Policy

A deterministic policy \(\pi\) is a function that maps each state \(s \in S\) to a specific action \(a \in A\):

\[
\pi: S \to A
\]

- **Example**: In a grid-world environment, a deterministic policy might specify that if the agent is in state \((x, y)\), it always moves "right".

#### 2. Stochastic Policy

A stochastic policy \(\pi\) is a function that maps each state \(s \in S\) to a probability distribution over actions \(A\):

\[
\pi: S \times A \to [0, 1]
\]

where \(\pi(a|s)\) represents the probability of taking action \(a\) given state \(s\).

- **Example**: In a grid-world environment, a stochastic policy might specify that if the agent is in state \((x, y)\), it moves "right" with probability 0.8 and "up" with probability 0.2.

### Policy Objective

The objective of the policy is to maximize the expected cumulative reward, often referred to as the return. This can be formalized as:

#### Expected Return

The expected return \(G_t\) at time step \(t\) is the total accumulated reward from time step \(t\) onwards, often discounted by a factor \(\gamma \):

\[
G_t = R_{t+1} + \gamma R_{t+2} + \gamma^2 R_{t+3} + \cdots = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \gamma^k R_{t+k+1}
\]

The goal is to find a policy \(\pi\) that maximizes the expected return from each state \(s\):

\[
V^\pi(s) = \mathbb{E}^\pi [G_t | s_t = s]
\]

where \(V^\pi(s)\) is the value function, representing the expected return from state \(s\) under policy \(\pi\).

### Policy Optimization

#### 1. Policy Gradient Methods

Policy gradient methods optimize the policy directly by maximizing the expected return using gradient ascent. The policy is parameterized by \(\theta\), and the objective is to maximize:

\[
J(\theta) = \mathbb{E}^\pi [G_t]
\]

The policy is updated using the policy gradient:

\[
\nabla_\theta J(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_\pi \left[ \nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a|s) Q^\pi(s, a) \right]
\]

#### 2. Actor-Critic Methods

Actor-critic methods combine policy-based and value-based methods. The actor updates the policy parameters \(\theta\) in the direction suggested by the critic, which estimates the value function.

- **Actor**: Responsible for selecting actions according to the policy \(\pi_\theta(a|s)\).
- **Critic**: Estimates the value function \(V^\pi(s)\) or action-value function \(Q^\pi(s, a)\).

### Example: Policy in Grid-World

#### Deterministic Policy Example

- **State Space (\(S\))**: Positions on a 5x5 grid, \(S = \{(x, y) | x, y \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\}\).
- **Action Space (\(A\))**: Movements \{up, down, left, right\}.

Deterministic policy \(\pi\):

\[
\pi((x, y)) = 
\begin{cases}
\text{right} & \text{if } y < 5 \\
\text{down} & \text{if } y = 5 \text{ and } x < 5 \\
\text{up} & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

#### Stochastic Policy Example

- **State Space (\(S\))**: Positions on a 5x5 grid.
- **Action Space (\(A\))**: Movements \{up, down, left, right\}.

Stochastic policy \(\pi\):

\[
\pi(\text{right} | (x, y)) = 
\begin{cases}
0.8 & \text{if } y < 5 \\
0.1 & \text{if } y = 5 \\
0.5 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

\[
\pi(\text{down} | (x, y)) = 
\begin{cases}
0.2 & \text{if } y < 5 \\
0.9 & \text{if } y = 5 \\
0.5 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

### Conclusion

A policy in [[reinforcement learning]] is a crucial component that defines the agent's behavior by mapping states to actions. It can be deterministic or stochastic, with the objective of maximizing the expected cumulative reward. Optimizing the policy involves various methods, including policy gradient methods and actor-critic approaches. Formalizing the policy helps in designing and analyzing RL algorithms, ensuring that the agent learns to make optimal decisions within the environment.
