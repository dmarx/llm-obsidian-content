**USER**

The Moran model


**ASSISTANT**

The **Moran model** is a mathematical model used in population genetics to describe the random changes in allele frequencies within a population due to genetic drift. Unlike the **Wright-Fisher model**, where reproduction occurs in discrete, non-overlapping generations, the Moran model assumes that reproduction occurs continuously in overlapping generations. Each reproduction event replaces one individual in the population, making it a more realistic model for certain biological systems with overlapping generations or small population sizes.

### Key Features of the Moran Model

1. **Overlapping Generations**: In the Moran model, individuals reproduce and die continuously, with one individual being replaced in each time step. This contrasts with the Wright-Fisher model, where an entire new generation is produced at once, replacing the old generation.

2. **Constant Population Size**: The population size \( N \) remains constant. At each time step, one individual is chosen to reproduce, and its offspring replaces a randomly chosen individual in the population. Therefore, each time step involves both reproduction and death, maintaining the population size at \( N \).

3. **Random Genetic Drift**: Like the Wright-Fisher model, the Moran model is driven by random fluctuations in allele frequencies due to sampling error. Each reproduction event randomly selects an individual to contribute offspring, leading to changes in allele frequencies over time.

### Model Assumptions

The classical Moran model operates under several key assumptions:
- **Diploid or Haploid Individuals**: The population can be diploid (each individual has two alleles per gene) or haploid (each individual has one allele per gene).
- **Neutral Evolution**: No selection is assumed in the basic Moran model, so all individuals have an equal probability of reproducing. However, the model can be extended to include natural selection.
- **Random Mating**: Any individual can reproduce with equal probability, and offspring are chosen randomly to replace another individual, ensuring that allele frequencies change due to genetic drift.

### Dynamics of the Moran Model

Letâ€™s assume a haploid population of size \( N \), and consider a bi-allelic system with two alleles: \( A \) and \( a \). Let \( p_t \) represent the frequency of allele \( A \) at time \( t \).

1. **Reproduction Event**: At each time step:
   - One individual is chosen at random to reproduce.
   - One individual (which may be the same or a different individual) is chosen at random to be replaced by the offspring of the reproducing individual.

2. **Change in Allele Frequency**: The allele frequency can change by increasing or decreasing by \( 1/N \), or it can remain the same. If \( k \) is the number of individuals carrying allele \( A \), the change in the frequency of \( A \) from \( k/N \) to \( (k+1)/N \) or \( (k-1)/N \) follows a **binomial process**:
   - **Probability of increasing** by \( 1/N \) (i.e., reproducing an \( A \)-allele individual and replacing an \( a \)-allele individual):
   $$
   P(\text{increase}) = \frac{k}{N} \cdot \frac{N - k}{N}
   $$
   - **Probability of decreasing** by \( 1/N \) (i.e., reproducing an \( a \)-allele individual and replacing an \( A \)-allele individual):
   $$
   P(\text{decrease}) = \frac{N - k}{N} \cdot \frac{k}{N}
   $$

3. **Fixation and Loss of Alleles**: In the long run, genetic drift will cause one allele to either become fixed (frequency \( p = 1 \)) or lost (frequency \( p = 0 \)). The probability of fixation of allele \( A \) is equal to its initial frequency in the population:
   $$
   P(\text{fixation of } A) = p_0 = \frac{k_0}{N}
   $$
   where \( k_0 \) is the initial number of \( A \)-allele individuals.

### Time to Fixation or Loss

The **expected time to fixation or loss** of an allele in the Moran model can be calculated and tends to be shorter than in the Wright-Fisher model due to the continuous nature of reproduction and allele replacement. The **expected time** to fixation of a neutral allele (starting at frequency \( p_0 \)) is given by:
$$
T_{\text{fixation}} = \frac{2N}{p_0(1 - p_0)}
$$
For a new mutation (with initial frequency \( p_0 = 1/N \)), the time to fixation becomes:
$$
T_{\text{fixation}} \approx 2N^2
$$

This result shows that for a neutral mutation, the time to fixation in the Moran model grows quadratically with the population size, \( N \), similar to the Wright-Fisher model, but the constant factor differs slightly.

### Moran Model with Selection

The classical Moran model can be extended to include **selection** by adjusting the probabilities of reproduction based on fitness differences between individuals. If individuals with allele \( A \) have a fitness advantage \( s \) over individuals with allele \( a \), then the reproduction probabilities are modified to account for selection.

- **Probability of increase** (if \( A \) has selective advantage \( s \)):
  $$
  P(\text{increase}) = \frac{k(1 + s)}{k(1 + s) + (N - k)} \cdot \frac{N - k}{N}
  $$

- **Probability of decrease**:
  $$
  P(\text{decrease}) = \frac{N - k}{k(1 + s) + (N - k)} \cdot \frac{k}{N}
  $$

The strength of selection is quantified by \( N s \), where \( N \) is the population size and \( s \) is the selection coefficient. If \( N s \gg 1 \), selection dominates, and the advantageous allele is more likely to fix. If \( N s \ll 1 \), genetic drift dominates, and the dynamics are effectively neutral.

### Differences Between the Moran and Wright-Fisher Models

1. **Generations**: The Moran model has overlapping generations with continuous time reproduction, while the Wright-Fisher model assumes discrete, non-overlapping generations.

2. **Reproductive Events**: In the Moran model, only one individual reproduces and one individual is replaced at each time step, leading to gradual changes in allele frequencies. In contrast, in the Wright-Fisher model, a whole generation is replaced at once, leading to larger jumps in allele frequencies from one generation to the next.

3. **Time to Fixation**: Although both models predict fixation of alleles due to drift, the Moran model generally leads to slower allele frequency changes and a slightly faster time to fixation than the Wright-Fisher model for the same population size, due to its continuous nature.

### Applications of the Moran Model

1. **Microbial Populations**: The Moran model is often used to study evolution in microbial populations where generations overlap, and the population size is relatively small. In such populations, genetic drift can have a strong impact on evolutionary dynamics.

2. **Cancer Evolution**: The model has also been applied to cancer evolution, where genetic mutations accumulate in a continuously dividing population of cells. In this context, drift, mutation, and selection interact to drive the evolution of cancerous cells.

3. **Population Genetics**: In population genetics, the Moran model is frequently used to study allele frequency dynamics under both drift and selection, especially in small populations where continuous reproduction is a reasonable assumption.

### Conclusion

The **Moran model** is a fundamental tool in population genetics that provides a framework for understanding genetic drift in populations with overlapping generations. By modeling continuous reproduction and random allele replacement, it allows for the study of allele frequency dynamics over time. The model can be extended to incorporate selection, making it versatile for studying both neutral and selective processes in small populations. Its simplicity and close relationship to the Wright-Fisher model make it a powerful model for analyzing evolutionary processes in many biological systems.
