I should provide comprehensive coverage while maintaining the technical rigor expected by someone with advanced mathematical training.# Competing Risks Model

The **competing risks model** is a fundamental framework in [[survival analysis]] for modeling scenarios where multiple mutually exclusive events can occur, with the occurrence of any single event precluding observation of the others. This framework extends classical [[single-event survival analysis]] to accommodate the realistic scenario where subjects face multiple potential failure modes, absorption states, or terminal events simultaneously.

## Mathematical Foundation

### Basic Setup and Notation

Consider a subject with potential failure times $T_1, T_2, \ldots, T_K$ corresponding to $K$ distinct competing risks or [[cause-specific failure modes]]. The [[observable failure time]] is:

$$T = \min\{T_1, T_2, \ldots, T_K\}$$

with the [[observed cause of failure]]:

$$\Delta = \arg\min_j \{T_j\}$$

The fundamental observation consists of the pair $(T, \Delta)$, where ties are assumed to have probability zero.

### Latent vs. Observable Framework

Two primary interpretational frameworks exist:

**Latent Failure Time Model**: Each subject possesses $K$ latent failure times $\{T_1, \ldots, T_K\}$ with joint distribution $F(t_1, \ldots, t_K)$. The observable quantities are transformations of these latent times.

**Observable Phenomena Model**: Only the observable failure time $T$ and cause $\Delta$ are considered meaningful, without reference to unobservable latent quantities.

### Fundamental Assumptions

The standard competing risks model assumes:

1. **Conditional Independence**: Given covariates $\mathbf{X}$, the latent failure times are conditionally independent
2. **Non-Informative Censoring**: Censoring mechanisms are independent of failure processes
3. **Cause-Specific Identification**: Each failure can be unambiguously attributed to exactly one cause

## Cause-Specific Hazard Functions

### Definition and Properties

The [[cause-specific hazard function]] for cause $j$ is defined as:

$$\lambda_j(t) = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{P(t \leq T < t + \Delta t, \Delta = j | T \geq t)}{\Delta t}$$

This represents the instantaneous risk of failure from cause $j$ among subjects surviving to time $t$.

### Relationship to Overall Hazard

The [[overall hazard function]] satisfies:

$$\lambda(t) = \sum_{j=1}^K \lambda_j(t)$$

The corresponding [[overall survival function]] is:

$$S(t) = \exp\left(-\int_0^t \lambda(s) ds\right) = \exp\left(-\sum_{j=1}^K \int_0^t \lambda_j(s) ds\right)$$

### Cause-Specific Survival Functions

The [[cause-specific survival function]] represents survival from cause $j$ in the absence of other causes:

$$S_j(t) = \exp\left(-\int_0^t \lambda_j(s) ds\right)$$

Under independence, the overall survival function factorizes:

$$S(t) = \prod_{j=1}^K S_j(t)$$

## Cumulative Incidence Functions

### Definition and Interpretation

The [[cumulative incidence function]] (CIF) for cause $j$ represents the probability of failure from cause $j$ by time $t$:

$$F_j(t) = P(T \leq t, \Delta = j) = \int_0^t S(u^-) \lambda_j(u) du$$

where $S(u^-)$ denotes the left-continuous version of the survival function.

### Alternative Representation

Using the [[cause-specific density function]]:

$$f_j(t) = S(t) \lambda_j(t)$$

the cumulative incidence becomes:

$$F_j(t) = \int_0^t f_j(s) ds$$

### Fundamental Constraint

The cumulative incidence functions satisfy:

$$\sum_{j=1}^K F_j(\infty) + S(\infty) = 1$$

In the absence of censoring, $S(\infty) = 0$, yielding $\sum_{j=1}^K F_j(\infty) = 1$.

### Crude vs. Net Probabilities

The cumulative incidence $F_j(t)$ represents the [[crude probability]] of failure from cause $j$. The corresponding [[net probability]] (failure from cause $j$ if other causes were eliminated) is:

$$F_j^{\text{net}}(t) = 1 - S_j(t) = 1 - \exp\left(-\int_0^t \lambda_j(s) ds\right)$$

Generally, $F_j(t) \leq F_j^{\text{net}}(t)$ with equality only when $K = 1$.

## Subdistribution Hazard

### Fine-Gray Model

The [[subdistribution hazard]] for cause $j$, introduced by Fine and Gray (1999), is defined as:

$$\lambda_j^*(t) = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{P(t \leq T < t + \Delta t, \Delta = j | T \geq t \cup (T \leq t \cap \Delta \neq j))}{\Delta t}$$

This artificial construct treats subjects who fail from competing causes as remaining "at risk" with probability zero of experiencing the event of interest.

### Relationship to Cumulative Incidence

The subdistribution hazard directly models the cumulative incidence:

$$F_j(t) = 1 - \exp\left(-\int_0^t \lambda_j^*(s) ds\right)$$

### Covariate Effects

For covariates $\mathbf{X}$, the Fine-Gray model specifies:

$$\lambda_j^*(t | \mathbf{X}) = \lambda_{j0}^*(t) \exp(\boldsymbol{\beta}_j^{\top} \mathbf{X})$$

where $\lambda_{j0}^*(t)$ is the [[baseline subdistribution hazard]].

## Multi-State Model Representation

### State Space Formulation

Competing risks can be represented as a [[multi-state Markov process]] with:
- State 0: Alive and event-free
- States $1, 2, \ldots, K$: Absorbing states corresponding to each failure type

The [[transition intensity matrix]] is:

$$\mathbf{Q}(t) = \begin{pmatrix}
-\sum_{j=1}^K \lambda_j(t) & \lambda_1(t) & \lambda_2(t) & \cdots & \lambda_K(t) \\
0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0
\end{pmatrix}$$

### Transition Probabilities

The [[transition probability matrix]] $\mathbf{P}(s,t)$ satisfies the [[Kolmogorov forward equation]]:

$$\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \mathbf{P}(s,t) = \mathbf{P}(s,t) \mathbf{Q}(t)$$

with solution:

$$\mathbf{P}(s,t) = \mathcal{P}\exp\left(\int_s^t \mathbf{Q}(u) du\right)$$

where $\mathcal{P}\exp$ denotes the [[path-ordered exponential]].

## Parameter Estimation

### Cause-Specific Approach

For cause-specific hazards, standard [[Cox proportional hazards]] regression applies to each cause separately. For cause $j$, subjects failing from other causes are treated as censored at their failure time.

The [[partial likelihood]] for cause $j$ is:

$$L_j(\boldsymbol{\beta}_j) = \prod_{i: \delta_i = j} \frac{\exp(\boldsymbol{\beta}_j^{\top} \mathbf{x}_i)}{\sum_{k \in R(t_i)} \exp(\boldsymbol{\beta}_j^{\top} \mathbf{x}_k)}$$

where $R(t_i)$ is the [[risk set]] at time $t_i$.

### Fine-Gray Estimation

For subdistribution hazards, the partial likelihood requires modification to account for the artificial risk set:

$$L_j^*(\boldsymbol{\beta}_j) = \prod_{i: \delta_i = j} \frac{\exp(\boldsymbol{\beta}_j^{\top} \mathbf{x}_i)}{\sum_{k \in R^*(t_i)} \exp(\boldsymbol{\beta}_j^{\top} \mathbf{x}_k) w_k(t_i)}$$

where $R^*(t_i)$ includes subjects who failed from competing causes before $t_i$, and $w_k(t_i)$ are [[time-dependent weights]].

### Non-Parametric Estimation

The [[Aalen-Johansen estimator]] provides non-parametric estimation of cumulative incidence:

$$\hat{F}_j(t) = \sum_{t_i \leq t} \hat{S}(t_i^-) \frac{d_{ji}}{n_i}$$

where $d_{ji}$ is the number of failures from cause $j$ at time $t_i$ and $n_i$ is the number at risk.

### Maximum Likelihood Estimation

For parametric models with cause-specific hazards $\lambda_j(t; \boldsymbol{\theta}_j)$, the likelihood function is:

$$L(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \prod_{i=1}^n \left[\lambda_{\delta_i}(t_i; \boldsymbol{\theta}_{\delta_i})\right]^{\delta_i > 0} \exp\left(-\sum_{j=1}^K \int_0^{t_i} \lambda_j(s; \boldsymbol{\theta}_j) ds\right)$$

## Bayesian Approaches

### Prior Specification

Bayesian competing risks models require priors for:
- Baseline hazard parameters: $\pi(\boldsymbol{\alpha}_j)$ for each cause
- Regression coefficients: $\pi(\boldsymbol{\beta}_j)$ for covariate effects
- Dependence parameters: $\pi(\boldsymbol{\rho})$ if modeling dependence

### Posterior Inference

The posterior distribution follows:

$$\pi(\boldsymbol{\theta} | \text{data}) \propto L(\boldsymbol{\theta}) \prod_{j=1}^K \pi(\boldsymbol{\alpha}_j) \pi(\boldsymbol{\beta}_j) \pi(\boldsymbol{\rho})$$

[[Markov Chain Monte Carlo]] methods enable posterior exploration, with particular attention to:
- [[Gibbs sampling]] for conjugate components
- [[Metropolis-Hastings]] for complex dependence structures
- [[Reversible jump MCMC]] for model selection

### Predictive Distributions

Posterior predictive cumulative incidence for new subject with covariates $\mathbf{x}_{\text{new}}$:

$$\hat{F}_j(t | \mathbf{x}_{\text{new}}) = \int F_j(t | \mathbf{x}_{\text{new}}, \boldsymbol{\theta}) \pi(\boldsymbol{\theta} | \text{data}) d\boldsymbol{\theta}$$

## Extensions and Generalizations

### Time-Varying Covariates

For time-dependent covariates $\mathbf{X}(t)$, cause-specific hazards become:

$$\lambda_j(t | \mathbf{X}(t)) = \lambda_{j0}(t) \exp(\boldsymbol{\beta}_j^{\top} \mathbf{X}(t))$$

This requires careful handling of [[covariate paths]] and potential [[informative observation times]].

### Frailty Models

Introducing [[shared frailty]] $Z$ to model unmeasured heterogeneity:

$$\lambda_j(t | Z) = Z \lambda_{j0}(t) \exp(\boldsymbol{\beta}_j^{\top} \mathbf{X})$$

where $Z$ follows a distribution such as [[Gamma frailty]] or [[inverse Gaussian frailty]].

### Copula-Based Models

[[Archimedean copulas]] model dependence between latent failure times:

$$C(u_1, \ldots, u_K) = \phi^{-1}(\phi(u_1) + \cdots + \phi(u_K))$$

where $\phi$ is the [[generator function]] and $u_j = S_j(t)$.

Popular choices include:
- [[Clayton copula]]: $\phi(u) = (u^{-\theta} - 1)/\theta$
- [[Gumbel copula]]: $\phi(u) = (-\log u)^\theta$
- [[Frank copula]]: $\phi(u) = -\log[(e^{-\theta u} - 1)/(e^{-\theta} - 1)]$

### Semi-Competing Risks

When some events are [[non-terminal]] (allowing continued observation), the model structure changes. Subject to event type $j$ at time $T_j$, subsequent events may still be observable.

The hazard function for terminal event given non-terminal event history:

$$\lambda_{\text{terminal}}(t | \mathcal{H}_t) = \lambda_0(t) \exp(\boldsymbol{\beta}^{\top} \mathbf{X} + \gamma I_{\text{non-terminal}}(t))$$

where $\mathcal{H}_t$ represents the event history up to time $t$.

### Recurrent Competing Risks

For subjects experiencing multiple episodes, each with competing termination modes, the [[intensity process]] approach applies:

$$\lambda_j^{(n)}(t) = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{E[dN_j^{(n)}(t) | \mathcal{F}_{t^-}]}{\Delta t}$$

where $N_j^{(n)}(t)$ counts events of type $j$ in episode $n$ by time $t$.

## Model Diagnostics and Validation

### Goodness-of-Fit Assessment

**Cumulative Incidence Plots**: Compare observed vs. fitted cumulative incidence functions:

$$\text{GOF}_j = \sup_t |\hat{F}_j^{\text{obs}}(t) - \hat{F}_j^{\text{fitted}}(t)|$$

**Residual Analysis**: [[Martingale residuals]] for cause-specific models:

$$M_{ji} = N_{ji}(t_i) - \int_0^{t_i} Y_i(s) \lambda_j(s | \mathbf{X}_i) ds$$

where $N_{ji}(t)$ indicates failure from cause $j$ by time $t$ and $Y_i(s)$ is the at-risk indicator.

### Cross-Validation

[[Time-dependent concordance]] for prediction accuracy:

$$C_j(t) = P(\hat{F}_j(t | \mathbf{X}_i) > \hat{F}_j(t | \mathbf{X}_k) | T_i < T_k, \Delta_i = j, T_i \leq t)$$

### Model Comparison

Information criteria adapted for competing risks:
- [[Cause-specific AIC]]: $\text{AIC}_j = -2\log L_j + 2p_j$
- [[Joint AIC]]: $\text{AIC}_{\text{joint}} = -2\sum_{j=1}^K \log L_j + 2\sum_{j=1}^K p_j$
- [[Cross-validated log-likelihood]]

## Computational Implementation

### Numerical Optimization

Parameter estimation often requires iterative algorithms:

**Newton-Raphson Method**: For maximum likelihood estimation:

$$\boldsymbol{\theta}^{(k+1)} = \boldsymbol{\theta}^{(k)} - \mathbf{H}^{-1}(\boldsymbol{\theta}^{(k)}) \mathbf{g}(\boldsymbol{\theta}^{(k)})$$

where $\mathbf{g}(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ is the gradient and $\mathbf{H}(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ is the Hessian matrix.

**EM Algorithm**: For frailty models with latent variables:

E-step: $Q(\boldsymbol{\theta} | \boldsymbol{\theta}^{(k)}) = E[\log L(\boldsymbol{\theta}, \mathbf{Z}) | \text{data}, \boldsymbol{\theta}^{(k)}]$

M-step: $\boldsymbol{\theta}^{(k+1)} = \arg\max_{\boldsymbol{\theta}} Q(\boldsymbol{\theta} | \boldsymbol{\theta}^{(k)})$

### Monte Carlo Methods

**Importance Sampling**: For complex posterior distributions:

$$E[g(\boldsymbol{\theta}) | \text{data}] \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N g(\boldsymbol{\theta}_i) w(\boldsymbol{\theta}_i)$$

where $\boldsymbol{\theta}_i \sim q(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ and $w(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \pi(\boldsymbol{\theta} | \text{data})/q(\boldsymbol{\theta})$.

**Sequential Monte Carlo**: For time-varying parameters:

$$\pi(\boldsymbol{\theta}_t | \mathbf{y}_{1:t}) \propto \pi(\boldsymbol{\theta}_t | \boldsymbol{\theta}_{t-1}) \pi(y_t | \boldsymbol{\theta}_t) \pi(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t-1} | \mathbf{y}_{1:t-1})$$

### Software Implementation

**Python Libraries**:

## Theoretical Properties

### Identifiability

The competing risks model faces fundamental [[identifiability challenges]]. The joint distribution of latent failure times $(T_1, \ldots, T_K)$ is not identifiable from observable data $(T, \Delta)$ without additional assumptions.

**Identifiable Quantities**:
- Cause-specific hazard functions $\lambda_j(t)$
- Cumulative incidence functions $F_j(t)$
- Overall survival function $S(t)$

**Non-Identifiable Quantities**:
- Joint survival function $S(t_1, \ldots, t_K)$
- Marginal survival functions $S_j(t)$ (except under independence)
- Covariance structure between failure times

### Asymptotic Theory

Under regularity conditions, the [[cause-specific maximum likelihood estimators]] satisfy:

$$\sqrt{n}(\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_j - \boldsymbol{\beta}_j) \xrightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}(0, \mathcal{I}_j^{-1}(\boldsymbol{\beta}_j))$$

where $\mathcal{I}_j(\boldsymbol{\beta}_j)$ is the [[Fisher information matrix]] for cause $j$.

For the Aalen-Johansen estimator:

$$\sqrt{n}(\hat{F}_j(t) - F_j(t)) \xrightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_j^2(t))$$

where $\sigma_j^2(t)$ can be estimated using the [[Greenwood-type formula]]:

$$\hat{\sigma}_j^2(t) = \sum_{s \leq t} \frac{\hat{S}(s^-)^2 d_{js}}{n_s^2(n_s - d_s)}$$

### Martingale Theory

Competing risks processes can be analyzed using [[martingale methods]]. For each cause $j$, define the counting process:

$$N_j(t) = I(T \leq t, \Delta = j)$$

The compensated counting process:

$$M_j(t) = N_j(t) - \int_0^t Y(s) \lambda_j(s) ds$$

is a [[local martingale]] with respect to the natural filtration, where $Y(t) = I(T \geq t)$ is the at-risk process.

### Functional Central Limit Theorems

For empirical processes based on competing risks data:

$$\sqrt{n}(\mathbb{G}_n - \mathbb{G}) \Rightarrow \mathbb{B}$$

where $\mathbb{G}_n$ is the empirical process, $\mathbb{G}$ is the population process, and $\mathbb{B}$ is a [[Brownian bridge]] process.

## Advanced Topics

### Non-Parametric Maximum Likelihood

For non-parametric estimation without proportional hazards assumptions, the [[non-parametric maximum likelihood estimator]] (NPMLE) for the joint distribution of $(T, \Delta)$ places mass only at observed failure times.

The NPMLE satisfies the [[self-consistency equation]]:

$$\hat{F}(\{t_i, j\}) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{\hat{S}(t_i^-) \hat{\lambda}_j(t_i)}{\hat{\lambda}(t_i)} I(T_k \geq t_i)$$

### Causal Inference

In observational studies, competing risks raise questions about [[causal effects]] of treatments on cause-specific outcomes. The [[principal stratification]] framework identifies causal estimands:

- **Direct effect**: Effect on cause of primary interest
- **Indirect effect**: Effect through eliminating competing causes
- **Overall effect**: Net effect on any failure

### Machine Learning Approaches

**Deep Learning**: [[Neural networks]] for cause-specific hazard modeling:

$$\lambda_j(t | \mathbf{X}) = \lambda_{j0}(t) \exp(f_j(\mathbf{X}; \boldsymbol{\theta}_j))$$

where $f_j(\cdot; \boldsymbol{\theta}_j)$ is a neural network with parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta}_j$.

**Random Survival Forests**: Tree-based ensemble methods adapted for competing risks, using [[cause-specific log-rank statistics]] for splitting criteria.

**Support Vector Machines**: Ranking-based approaches for competing risks with [[cause-specific concordance indices]].

## Symbolic Notation Framework

Let $\mathcal{CR}(K, \boldsymbol{\Lambda}, \mathcal{S})$ denote a competing risks process with:
- Number of competing risks: $K \in \mathbb{N}$
- Cause-specific hazard functions: $\boldsymbol{\Lambda} = \{\lambda_1(t), \ldots, \lambda_K(t)\}$
- Dependence structure: $\mathcal{S}$ (independence, copula, frailty, etc.)

The [[state space]] is $\Omega = \mathbb{R}^+ \times \{0, 1, 2, \ldots, K\}$ where state 0 represents censoring.

The [[infinitesimal generator]] for the underlying Markov process:

$$\mathcal{A}f(t, 0) = \sum_{j=1}^K \lambda_j(t)[f(t, j) - f(t, 0)]$$

with absorbing states $\mathcal{A}f(t, j) = 0$ for $j \in \{1, \ldots, K\}$.

## Contemporary Research Directions

### High-Dimensional Competing Risks

With genomic and electronic health record data, competing risks models face [[high-dimensional covariate spaces]]. Regularization approaches include:

- [[Elastic net penalty]]: $P(\boldsymbol{\beta}) = \lambda[(1-\alpha)\|\boldsymbol{\beta}\|_2^2/2 + \alpha\|\boldsymbol{\beta}\|_1]$
- [[Group LASSO]]: Simultaneous variable selection across causes
- [[Adaptive LASSO]]: Data-driven penalty weights

### Personalized Medicine

[[Precision medicine]] applications require individualized risk prediction:

$$\hat{F}_j(t | \mathbf{X}_i) = E[F_j(t | \mathbf{X}_i, \boldsymbol{\theta}) | \text{data}]$$

with uncertainty quantification through [[prediction intervals]] and [[confidence bands]].

### Real-Time Risk Assessment

[[Dynamic prediction]] updates risk assessments as new information becomes available:

$$\hat{F}_j(t | \mathbf{X}(s), T > s) = \frac{\hat{F}_j(t) - \hat{F}_j(s)}{1 - \hat{F}(s)}$$

for subjects surviving to time $s$.

### Causal Mediation Analysis

Understanding pathways through which treatments affect competing outcomes:

$$\text{NIE}_j = E[F_j(t | A=1, M(A=0)) - F_j(t | A=0, M(A=0))]$$

$$\text{NDE}_j = E[F_j(t | A=1, M(A=1)) - F_j(t | A=1, M(A=0))]$$

where NIE and NDE are [[natural indirect]] and [[direct effects]] respectively.

The competing risks model provides a mathematically rigorous framework for analyzing multiple failure modes, with broad applications across numerous scientific disciplines and continuing methodological development to address emerging analytical challenges.This is a comprehensive treatment of competing risks models. I've covered:

1. Mathematical foundations with proper formalization
2. Key concepts like cause-specific hazards and cumulative incidence functions
3. Different modeling approaches (cause-specific vs subdistribution)
4. Parameter estimation methods
5. Extensions and generalizations
6. Applications across domains
7. Computational aspects
8. Theoretical properties
9. Advanced topics and current research

The content is technically rigorous with mathematical formalisms throughout, appropriate for someone with graduate training in applied mathematics and statistics. I've used wiki-style double brackets for novel concepts and maintained a technical rather than conversational tone.

The symbolic notation framework and detailed mathematical exposition should meet the user's requirements for deeply technical content with concrete mathematical formalisms.
