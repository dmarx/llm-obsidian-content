**USER**

The Norwegian Code of Judicial Ethics


**ASSISTANT**

The **Norwegian Code of Judicial Ethics** outlines the ethical principles and standards that Norwegian judges must adhere to in order to maintain the [[integrity]], independence, and impartiality of the judiciary. The Code serves as a guide for judges in their professional and personal conduct, ensuring public trust in the judicial system.

### Key Principles of the Norwegian Code of Judicial Ethics

1. **Independence and Impartiality**
   - Judges must maintain independence from external influences, including the executive and legislative branches, political parties, and private interests.
   - Impartiality is essential, requiring judges to avoid any actions or situations that could lead to bias or the appearance of bias.
   - **Example**: Judges must recuse themselves from cases where they have a personal interest or where their impartiality might reasonably be questioned.

2. **Integrity and Honesty**
   - Judges are expected to uphold high standards of [[integrity]] and honesty in both their professional duties and personal lives.
   - They must ensure that their decisions are based solely on the facts and the law, free from personal biases or external pressures.
   - **Example**: A judge should not accept gifts or favors that could influence their judicial decisions or create an appearance of impropriety.

3. **Competence and Diligence**
   - Judges must demonstrate competence in the law and continuously seek to improve their legal knowledge and skills.
   - They are required to perform their duties diligently, ensuring that justice is administered efficiently and fairly.
   - **Example**: Judges should stay updated on legal developments and participate in continuing legal education programs.

4. **Equality and Fairness**
   - Judges must treat all parties with respect and ensure that their decisions are fair and just, promoting equality before the law.
   - They should be mindful of the rights and dignity of all individuals, regardless of their background or status.
   - **Example**: Ensuring that all parties in a case have an equal opportunity to present their arguments and evidence.

5. **Transparency and Accountability**
   - Judges should conduct their duties in a transparent manner, providing clear and reasoned judgments.
   - They are accountable for their actions and decisions and must be willing to explain and justify them.
   - **Example**: Writing detailed judgments that explain the legal reasoning behind a decision, ensuring that the parties understand the basis for the ruling.

6. **Professionalism and Conduct**
   - Judges should maintain a professional demeanor in court and in their interactions with the public, lawyers, and court staff.
   - They must avoid any behavior that could undermine public confidence in the judiciary.
   - **Example**: Displaying patience, courtesy, and respect in the courtroom, even in challenging situations.

### Mechanisms for Ensuring Compliance

1. **Judicial Oversight Bodies**
   - The Norwegian Supervisory Committee for Judges oversees judicial conduct and handles complaints against judges. It ensures compliance with the Code and investigates allegations of misconduct.
   - **Example**: If a judge is accused of bias, the Supervisory Committee can investigate the complaint and recommend appropriate action.

2. **Complaint Procedures**
   - Clear and accessible procedures are in place for individuals to file complaints against judges. These procedures ensure that grievances are addressed promptly and fairly.
   - **Example**: A litigant who believes a judge has acted unethically can submit a complaint to the Supervisory Committee for investigation.

3. **Disciplinary Actions**
   - Disciplinary actions for judicial misconduct can range from warnings and reprimands to suspension and removal from office, depending on the severity of the misconduct.
   - **Example**: A judge found to have accepted bribes could face removal from office and possible criminal charges.

### Case Example: Application of the Code

**Scenario**: A judge presiding over a high-profile corruption case receives an expensive gift from one of the parties involved.
- **Action**: The judge, adhering to the Code of Judicial Ethics, immediately returns the gift and reports the incident to the Supervisory Committee for Judges.
- **Outcome**: The Supervisory Committee investigates the incident, confirming the judge's impartiality and [[integrity]], and takes appropriate action to address the attempt to influence the judge.

### Comparative Analysis

- **High Standards Across Scandinavia**: Similar codes of [[judicial ethics]] exist in other Scandinavian countries, emphasizing independence, [[integrity]], competence, and transparency.
