# Beta Reduction

Beta reduction ($\beta$-reduction) is a fundamental operation in [[lambda calculus]] that formalizes the process of [[function application]]. It represents the computational step of applying a function to an argument by substituting the argument for the function's parameter.

## Formal Definition

Given a lambda term of the form $(\lambda x.M)N$, where $M$ and $N$ are arbitrary lambda terms, a single step of beta reduction is defined as:

$$(\lambda x.M)N \to_\beta M[x := N]$$

where $M[x := N]$ denotes the substitution of $N$ for all free occurrences of $x$ in $M$.

## Substitution

The substitution operation $M[x := N]$ must be performed carefully to avoid [[variable capture]]. The formal definition is:

1. $x[x := N] = N$
2. $y[x := N] = y$ (when $x \neq y$)
3. $(P Q)[x := N] = (P[x := N]) (Q[x := N])$
4. $(\lambda y.P)[x := N] = \lambda y.(P[x := N])$ (when $x \neq y$ and $y$ is not free in $N$)
5. $(\lambda y.P)[x := N] = \lambda z.(P[y := z][x := N])$ (when condition in rule 4 doesn't hold, where $z$ is a fresh variable)

Rule 5 implements [[alpha conversion]] to avoid variable capture by renaming bound variables as needed.

## Example Reductions

### Simple Example
$$(\lambda x.x)a \to_\beta a$$

### Nested Application
$$(\lambda x.(\lambda y.x))a b \to_\beta (\lambda y.a)b \to_\beta a$$

### Function Composition
$$(\lambda f.\lambda g.\lambda x.(f(g x)))(\lambda y.y^2)(\lambda z.z+1)3 \to_\beta^* (3+1)^2 = 16$$

where $\to_\beta^*$ denotes multiple steps of beta reduction.

## Reduction Strategies

Different [[evaluation strategies]] can be employed when multiple beta redexes (reducible expressions) are present:

### Normal Order Reduction
- Leftmost-outermost strategy
- Always reduces the leftmost, outermost redex first
- Corresponds to [[call-by-name]] evaluation
- Guaranteed to reach a normal form if one exists

### Applicative Order Reduction
- Leftmost-innermost strategy
- Always reduces the leftmost, innermost redex first
- Corresponds to [[call-by-value]] evaluation
- More efficient in many cases but may not terminate when normal order would

### Call-by-Need (Lazy Evaluation)
- Similar to normal order but avoids repeated evaluation
- Implemented through [[graph reduction]] in languages like [[Haskell]]

## Beta Normal Form

A lambda term is in **beta normal form** if it contains no beta redexes (i.e., no subterms of the form $(\lambda x.M)N$).

Formally, the set of terms in beta normal form can be defined inductively:
- Variables are in normal form
- If $M$ is in normal form, then $\lambda x.M$ is in normal form
- If $M$ and $N$ are in normal form and $M$ is not an abstraction, then $(M N)$ is in normal form

## Theoretical Properties

### Confluence (Church-Rosser Theorem)
The [[Church-Rosser theorem]] states that if a term $M$ can be reduced to two different terms $N_1$ and $N_2$, then there exists a term $P$ such that both $N_1$ and $N_2$ can be reduced to $P$:

$$\text{If } M \to_\beta^* N_1 \text{ and } M \to_\beta^* N_2 \text{, then } \exists P \text{ such that } N_1 \to_\beta^* P \text{ and } N_2 \to_\beta^* P$$

This ensures that the order of reductions doesn't matter for the final result.

### Standardization Theorem
The [[standardization theorem]] states that if $M \to_\beta^* N$, then there exists a standard reduction sequence from $M$ to $N$.

### Normalization
- A term is **weakly normalizing** if there exists some reduction sequence leading to a normal form
- A term is **strongly normalizing** if every reduction sequence eventually leads to a normal form
- The untyped lambda calculus is not strongly normalizing (e.g., $(\lambda x.xx)(\lambda x.xx)$)
- The [[simply typed lambda calculus]] is strongly normalizing (all well-typed terms have a normal form)

## Computational Significance

Beta reduction embodies the essence of computation in the lambda calculus:
- Provides an operational semantics for [[functional programming]]
- Forms the basis for [[implementation techniques]] in functional language compilers
- Connects to the [[denotational semantics]] of programming languages
- Underlies [[type checking algorithms]] in static type systems
- Serves as a model for studying [[program optimization]] techniques

## Formal Notation

The operational semantics of beta reduction can be expressed using inference rules:

$$\frac{}{(\lambda x.M)N \to_\beta M[x := N]} \text{ (β)}$$

$$\frac{M \to_\beta M'}{M N \to_\beta M' N} \text{ (App1)}$$

$$\frac{N \to_\beta N'}{M N \to_\beta M N'} \text{ (App2)}$$

$$\frac{M \to_\beta M'}{\lambda x.M \to_\beta \lambda x.M'} \text{ (ξ)}$$

These rules define the contexts in which beta reduction can occur, allowing us to formalize different evaluation strategies by restricting which rules can be applied in what order.

## Beta Reduction and Computation

### Relationship to Turing Machines

Beta reduction in lambda calculus is equivalent in computational power to the state transitions of a [[Turing machine]]. This equivalence forms the basis of the [[Church-Turing thesis]], which posits that any effectively calculable function can be computed using lambda calculus.

The correspondence can be formalized:
- A Turing machine's tape and state can be encoded as a lambda term
- Each state transition corresponds to a sequence of beta reductions
- A Turing machine halts if and only if the corresponding lambda term reduces to a normal form under a specific evaluation strategy

### Operational Complexity

The time complexity of beta reduction depends on the implementation:

- **Naive substitution**: Each beta reduction may cause an exponential blowup in term size
- **Environment-based evaluation**: Maintains a mapping from variables to their values
- **Graph reduction**: Represents terms as directed graphs, sharing common subexpressions

For a term of size $n$, a single beta reduction can take $O(n^2)$ time in the worst case using naive substitution, due to the cost of avoiding variable capture.

## Advanced Topics in Beta Reduction

### Partial Evaluation

[[Partial evaluation]] applies beta reduction to a program where only some of its inputs are known:

$$(\lambda x.\lambda y.M)N \to_\beta \lambda y.M[x := N]$$

This technique is used in [[program optimization]] to specialize general programs for specific use cases.

### Optimal Reduction

[[Optimal reduction]] strategies, first investigated by [[Jean-Jacques Lévy]], minimize the total number of beta reductions needed to reach a normal form.

These strategies identify and reduce [[shared redexes]] simultaneously through techniques like:
- [[Name-free representations]]
- [[Explicit substitutions]]
- [[Interaction nets]]

### Explicit Substitutions

The [[lambda calculus with explicit substitutions]] (λσ-calculus) makes the substitution operation a first-class concept:

$$(\lambda x.M)N \to M[x := N]$$

where $[x := N]$ is a substitution operator that propagates through the term according to specific rules.

This approach:
- Provides a more realistic model of implementations
- Allows fine-grained analysis of complexity
- Bridges the gap between theoretical and practical aspects of functional programming

## Beta Reduction in Type Systems

### Subject Reduction

The [[subject reduction]] (or [[type preservation]]) property states that beta reduction preserves types:

$$\text{If } \Gamma \vdash M : \tau \text{ and } M \to_\beta N, \text{ then } \Gamma \vdash N : \tau$$

This property ensures that well-typed programs don't "go wrong" during evaluation.

### Reduction in Dependent Types

In systems with [[dependent types]], beta reduction becomes essential for type checking:

$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash M : \Pi x:A.B \quad \Gamma \vdash N : A}{\Gamma \vdash M N : B[x := N]}$$

The type $B[x := N]$ involves a substitution, which requires beta reduction during type checking.

### Normalization by Evaluation

[[Normalization by evaluation]] (NbE) is a technique that computes normal forms by:
1. Interpreting terms into a semantic domain
2. Extracting normal forms from semantic values

This approach has applications in:
- [[Proof assistants]]
- [[Type checking algorithms]]
- [[Compiler optimizations]]

## Implementation Techniques

### De Bruijn Indices

[[De Bruijn indices]] replace named variables with numeric indices that count the number of lambda abstractions between a variable occurrence and its binder:

$$\lambda x.\lambda y.x(y x) \mapsto \lambda.\lambda.1(0~1)$$

This simplifies alpha conversion and substitution, as variables are uniquely identified by their binding depth.

### Combinatory Logic

[[Combinatory logic]] eliminates the need for variables and substitution by using a fixed set of combinators:

- **I** (identity): $\lambda x.x$
- **K** (constant): $\lambda x.\lambda y.x$
- **S** (substitution): $\lambda x.\lambda y.\lambda z.(x z)(y z)$

Any lambda term can be translated into an equivalent term using only these combinators.

### Abstract Machines

Various [[abstract machines]] provide efficient implementations of beta reduction:

- **SECD machine**: A stack-based machine with environment, control, and dump components
- **Krivine machine**: Implements call-by-name evaluation
- **G-machine**: Implements graph reduction for lazy evaluation
- **STG machine**: The Spineless Tagless G-machine used in [[GHC]] (Glasgow Haskell Compiler)

## Applications in Programming Languages

### Lambda Lifting

[[Lambda lifting]] transforms local function definitions into global ones by adding free variables as parameters:

$$\lambda x.(\lambda y.x+y) \mapsto \lambda x.(\lambda y.\lambda z.y+z)~x$$

This simplifies compilation by eliminating nested scopes.

### Closure Conversion

[[Closure conversion]] transforms lambda abstractions into closures—pairs of code and environment:

$$\lambda x.M \mapsto (\lambda \langle x, env \rangle.M', env')$$

where $env'$ captures the free variables in $M$.

### Continuation-Passing Style

[[Continuation-passing style]] (CPS) transformation makes control flow explicit by passing continuations:

$$M~N \mapsto \lambda k.(M'~(\lambda f.(N'~(\lambda v.(f~v~k)))))$$

This transformation simplifies control flow analysis and enables optimizations like [[tail call elimination]].

## Formal Properties Formulation

We can express the [[confluence property]] of beta reduction more formally using the notation of [[rewriting systems]]:

Let $\to_\beta$ be the single-step beta reduction relation, and $\to_\beta^*$ its reflexive transitive closure.

The Church-Rosser property states:
$$\forall M, N_1, N_2. \text{ If } M \to_\beta^* N_1 \text{ and } M \to_\beta^* N_2, \text{ then } \exists P \text{ such that } N_1 \to_\beta^* P \text{ and } N_2 \to_\beta^* P$$

This can be visualized as:
```
    M
   / \
  /   \
N1     N2
  \   /
   \ /
    P
```

This property ensures the uniqueness of normal forms, a critical feature for deterministic computation.
