aphex twin music videos


**ASSISTANT**

Aphex Twin, the alias of Richard D. James, is renowned not only for his groundbreaking and experimental electronic music but also for the visually distinctive, often unsettling music videos that accompany his work. Several of these videos have become iconic in their own right, blending surreal, disturbing imagery with cutting-edge visual effects. Here are some of the most notable Aphex Twin music videos:

### 1. **Come to Daddy (1997)**
Directed by: **Chris Cunningham**

This is arguably Aphex Twin's most famous and disturbing music video. Directed by avant-garde director Chris Cunningham, "Come to Daddy" blends horror, surrealism, and dark humor. The video depicts a group of young children (wearing Richard D. James' face as masks) wreaking havoc in a dystopian urban landscape. It culminates in a demonic creature emerging from a television screen and screaming the titular refrain. The video was instrumental in establishing both Cunningham’s and Aphex Twin's reputation for eerie, grotesque aesthetics.

#### Key elements:
- **Visual effects**: The facial morphing techniques and eerie child doppelgängers are iconic.
- **Tone**: A mix of grotesque horror and dark, exaggerated humor, matching the intensity of the song.

### 2. **Windowlicker (1999)**
Directed by: **Chris Cunningham**

Another collaboration with Chris Cunningham, "Windowlicker" is an iconic and subversive take on the hip-hop music video genre. It begins with a long, absurdist skit where two men hurl obscenities at women before Aphex Twin, embodying a ridiculously elongated limousine-driving version of himself, steals the scene. As with "Come to Daddy," the video features women whose faces have been digitally replaced with Richard D. James' signature grin, creating an unsettling and comedic effect.

#### Key elements:
- **Subversion of mainstream tropes**: The video mocks the conventions of rap and R&B videos, such as over-the-top wealth and objectification of women.
- **Facial distortion**: Similar to "Come to Daddy," the video uses facial manipulation for both humorous and unsettling effects.

### 3. **Rubber Johnny (2005)**
Directed by: **Chris Cunningham**

"Rubber Johnny" is a short film paired with an Aphex Twin track from the album *drukQs*. The film is shot entirely in night-vision and features a deformed humanoid (portrayed by Cunningham himself) trapped in a dark room, responding to the music with frenetic, twitching movements. While only six minutes long, the video’s bizarre, claustrophobic atmosphere and grotesque body horror imagery have made it a cult favorite.

#### Key elements:
- **Nightmarish imagery**: The grotesque physical deformities and unsettling movements create a sense of horror.
- **Experimental visuals**: The video uses low lighting and high contrast to enhance the otherworldly atmosphere.

### 4. **Ventolin (1995)**
Directed by: **Steve Connor**

"Ventolin" is a more straightforward video but still carries Aphex Twin's penchant for the unsettling. It was shot in a grainy, lo-fi style and uses disturbing, rapid-cut imagery, reflecting the abrasive, high-pitched tones of the track. The song itself mimics the sound of an asthma inhaler (from which it takes its name), and the video echoes the suffocating, frantic energy of the music.

#### Key elements:
- **Lo-fi aesthetic**: The grainy, distorted visuals match the harsh, industrial sound of the music.
- **Disorientation**: The fast cuts and jittery editing contribute to a chaotic and claustrophobic feeling.

### 5. **On (1993)**
Directed by: **Jarvis Cocker**

"On" is a more abstract and serene video compared to the nightmarish visuals of later Aphex Twin videos. Directed by [[Jarvis Cocker]], the frontman of the band Pulp, it features tranquil landscapes, strange floating objects, and dream-like sequences. The ambient and soothing tones of the track contrast sharply with the more aggressive and eerie tracks Aphex Twin is known for.

#### Key elements:
- **Surreal landscapes**: The video showcases peaceful nature scenes with inexplicable floating objects, matching the ambient nature of the music.
- **Dream-like quality**: The video is far more meditative than Aphex Twin's more famous videos.

### 6. **Minipops 67 [120.2][source field mix] (2014)**
Directed by: **Weirdcore**

This is the lead track from Aphex Twin's album *Syro*, marking his return after a long hiatus. The video for "Minipops 67" was directed by long-time collaborator Weirdcore, and it features abstract, glitchy visuals with faces and body parts shifting in and out of recognition, mirroring the complex and layered sound of the track.

#### Key elements:
- **Abstract glitch visuals**: Faces and images appear distorted and broken, reflecting the complexity of the track’s structure.
- **Return to form**: The video marks a return to Aphex Twin’s signature fusion of audio-visual experimentalism.

### 7. **T69 Collapse (2018)**
Directed by: **Weirdcore**

For the track “T69 Collapse,” Weirdcore continued the abstract, surreal style seen in previous Aphex Twin videos. The video features strobing, hypnotic patterns, fractal landscapes, and rapidly morphing digital landscapes. The frenetic visuals match the erratic and complex rhythms of the track, making it an intense visual experience.

#### Key elements:
- **Fractal imagery**: The use of recursive patterns and geometric shapes reflects the mathematically intricate rhythms of the music.
- **Strobing visuals**: The video uses flashing lights and rapid transitions, contributing to its chaotic, disorienting feel.

### 8. **Donkey Rhubarb (1995)**
Directed by: **David Slade**

A surreal and playful departure from Aphex Twin's darker themes, "Donkey Rhubarb" features giant teddy bears dancing in a whimsical setting. The playful yet eerie atmosphere is both unsettling and humorous, juxtaposing the mechanical and driving beats of the song.

#### Key elements:
- **Whimsical surrealism**: The video maintains an eerie feel while embracing a more absurd, playful tone.
- **Giant dancing teddy bears**: Iconic imagery that sticks in the viewer’s mind, creating a strange juxtaposition with the industrial beats.

These videos not only complement the experimental nature of Aphex Twin’s music but also stand as works of art in their own right. The collaborations with directors like Chris Cunningham and Weirdcore have produced some of the most innovative and memorable music videos in electronic music history.
