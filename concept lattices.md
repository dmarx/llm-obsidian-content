# Concept Lattices

[[Concept lattices]], also known as [[Galois lattices]], provide a mathematical framework for [[formal concept analysis]] (FCA) that organizes and represents conceptual hierarchies derived from [[binary relations]] between objects and their attributes.

## Mathematical Foundation

### [[Formal Context]]
A formal context K = (G,M,I) consists of:
- G: set of objects ([[extent]])
- M: set of attributes ([[intent]])
- I ⊆ G×M: [[incidence relation]]

### [[Formal Concept]]
A formal concept is a pair (A,B) where:
- A ⊆ G (extent)
- B ⊆ M (intent)
- A = {g ∈ G | ∀m ∈ B: (g,m) ∈ I}
- B = {m ∈ M | ∀g ∈ A: (g,m) ∈ I}

## Derivation Operators

For X ⊆ G and Y ⊆ M:
- X' = {m ∈ M | ∀g ∈ X: (g,m) ∈ I}
- Y' = {g ∈ G | ∀m ∈ Y: (g,m) ∈ I}

Properties:
1. X₁ ⊆ X₂ ⟹ X₂' ⊆ X₁'
2. X ⊆ X''
3. X''' = X'
4. (X₁ ∪ X₂)' = X₁' ∩ X₂'

## Lattice Structure

### [[Concept Ordering]]
(A₁,B₁) ≤ (A₂,B₂) ⟺ A₁ ⊆ A₂ ⟺ B₂ ⊆ B₁

### [[Meet and Join]]
For concepts (A₁,B₁) and (A₂,B₂):
- Meet: (A₁,B₁) ∧ (A₂,B₂) = (A₁ ∩ A₂, (A₁ ∩ A₂)')
- Join: (A₁,B₁) ∨ (A₂,B₂) = ((B₁ ∩ B₂)', B₁ ∩ B₂)

## Applications

### [[Knowledge Discovery]]
- [[Conceptual Clustering]]
- [[Attribute Exploration]]
- [[Implication Discovery]]

### [[Data Analysis]]
- [[Feature Hierarchy]] extraction
- [[Conceptual Scaling]]
- [[Dependency Analysis]]

### [[Information Retrieval]]
- [[Document Classification]]
- [[Query Refinement]]
- [[Semantic Navigation]]

## Algorithms

### [[Concept Generation]]
1. [[NextClosure Algorithm]]
2. [[Close-by-One]] (CbO)
3. [[AddIntent Algorithm]]

### [[Lattice Construction]]
1. [[Bordat's Algorithm]]
2. [[Lindig's Algorithm]]
3. [[Incremental Algorithm]]

This formalism provides powerful tools for [[knowledge representation]], [[data analysis]], and [[conceptual modeling]] in various domains.
