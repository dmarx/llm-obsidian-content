**USER**

Nash Embedding Theorem


**ASSISTANT**

The **Nash Embedding Theorem** is a profound result in differential geometry that states any smooth Riemannian manifold can be isometrically embedded into a Euclidean space. This theorem, proved by John Nash in the 1950s, has significant implications for the study of geometry and the theory of manifolds. It connects the intrinsic geometry of a manifold, defined by distances and angles measured within the manifold, to the extrinsic geometry of a higher-dimensional Euclidean space.

### Statement of the Nash Embedding Theorem

There are two main versions of the Nash embedding theorem: the **immersion theorem** and the **embedding theorem**.

#### Nash Immersion Theorem (1954)

The Nash immersion theorem states that any \(n\)-dimensional Riemannian manifold can be smoothly immersed in a Euclidean space \(\mathbb{R}^{n(n+1)/2}\).

#### Nash Embedding Theorem (1956)

The stronger result, the Nash embedding theorem, states that any \(n\)-dimensional Riemannian manifold \((M, g)\) can be isometrically embedded into \(\mathbb{R}^{N}\) for some sufficiently large \(N\). Specifically:

- **Compact Manifolds**: Any compact \(n\)-dimensional Riemannian manifold \((M, g)\) can be isometrically embedded into \(\mathbb{R}^{n(3n+11)/2}\).
- **Non-Compact Manifolds**: Any \(n\)-dimensional Riemannian manifold \((M, g)\) can be locally isometrically embedded into \(\mathbb{R}^{n(3n+11)/2}\).

### Key Concepts

1. **Riemannian Manifold**: A smooth manifold \(M\) equipped with a Riemannian metric \(g\), which defines the inner product on the tangent space at each point. This metric allows the measurement of distances and angles within \(M\).
2. **Isometric Embedding**: A map \(f: (M, g) \to (\mathbb{R}^N, \langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle)\) is an isometric embedding if it preserves the metric, meaning:
   $$
   g_p(X, Y) = \langle df_p(X), df_p(Y) \rangle \quad \text{for all } X, Y \in T_p M, \text{ for all } p \in M.
   ```
3. **Euclidean Space**: The space \(\mathbb{R}^N\) with the standard Euclidean metric \(\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle\).

### Implications

The Nash embedding theorem provides a bridge between the intrinsic and extrinsic geometry of manifolds. An intrinsic property, such as the distance between points measured within the manifold, can be realized as the usual Euclidean distance in a higher-dimensional space. This result implies that abstract geometric properties of a manifold can be represented concretely in Euclidean space.

### Applications

1. **General Relativity**: In the theory of general relativity, the Nash embedding theorem implies that the curved spacetime described by Einstein's field equations can be embedded into a higher-dimensional flat space. This provides a way to visualize and analyze curved spacetime within the framework of Euclidean geometry.
2. **Geometric Analysis**: The theorem is used in geometric analysis to study the properties of manifolds by embedding them into Euclidean space, where the tools of analysis are more readily available.
3. **Mathematical Physics**: Embedding theorems are used to understand the structure of solutions to various physical equations, such as those arising in fluid dynamics and elasticity.

### Example: Embedding a 2D Surface

Consider a 2-dimensional Riemannian manifold \(M\) with a metric \(g\). According to the Nash embedding theorem, \(M\) can be isometrically embedded into a sufficiently high-dimensional Euclidean space \(\mathbb{R}^N\). For instance, a 2-dimensional surface like a sphere can be embedded in \(\mathbb{R}^3\) while preserving its metric properties, meaning the intrinsic distances and angles on the sphere are the same as those induced by the embedding in \(\mathbb{R}^3\).

### Conclusion

The Nash embedding theorem is a landmark result in differential geometry, demonstrating that any Riemannian manifold can be realized as a submanifold of some Euclidean space. This theorem has deep theoretical significance and practical applications in many areas of mathematics and physics, providing a concrete way to study and visualize complex geometric structures.

**USER**

Nash [[embedding]] theorem


**ASSISTANT**

The **Nash Embedding Theorem** is a fundamental result in differential geometry, proved by John Nash in 1956, which demonstrates that any smooth Riemannian manifold can be isometrically embedded into some Euclidean space. This theorem is pivotal for its implications in the fields of geometry, analysis, and mathematical physics, as it provides a concrete geometric framework for abstract spaces.

### Overview of the Nash Embedding Theorem

John Nash extended the classical [[embedding]] results by showing that every smooth Riemannian manifold can be embedded isometrically in a Euclidean space. An **isometric [[embedding]]** is a map between two metric spaces that preserves the distances exactly as measured within each space.

### Formal Statement of the Theorem

The Nash Embedding Theorem can be stated in two forms, reflecting slightly different assumptions and outcomes:

1. **C^1 Isometric Embedding**:
   - Every smooth Riemannian manifold \((M, g)\) of dimension \(n\) can be isometrically embedded into \(\mathbb{R}^N\) with a \(C^1\) [[embedding]], where \(N\) depends on \(n\) and typically is no greater than \(\frac{n(n+5)}{2}\).

2. **C^\infty Isometric Embedding**:
   - Every smooth Riemannian manifold \((M, g)\) can be isometrically embedded into \(\mathbb{R}^N\) with a \(C^\infty\) (smooth) [[embedding]], where \(N\) is usually larger than that required for the \(C^1\) [[embedding]].

### Key Concepts and Definitions

- **Riemannian Manifold**: A smooth manifold equipped with a Riemannian metric, which is a smoothly varying positive definite inner product on the tangent space at each point.

- **Isometric Embedding**: A map \( f: M \to \mathbb{R}^N \) is an isometric [[embedding]] if for every pair of points \( p, q \in M \), the distance between \( f(p) \) and \( f(q) \) in \(\mathbb{R}^N\) is the same as the distance between \( p \) and \( q \) in \( M \) as measured by the Riemannian metric \( g \).

### Proof Ideas and Techniques

The proof of the Nash Embedding Theorem is highly non-trivial and involves sophisticated mathematical techniques:

- **Approximation and Iteration**: Nash's approach involves initially finding a rough [[embedding]] and then improving this [[embedding]] through a series of iterations, using the implicit function theorem to ensure these iterations converge to an isometric [[embedding]].

- **Control of Curvature**: A key challenge is controlling the induced metric on the embedded manifold. Nash developed techniques to handle the curvature and other geometric quantities to make them align exactly with those of the target Euclidean space.

### Implications and Applications

- **Theoretical Physics**: In general relativity and other theories involving spacetime models, the ability to think of abstract manifolds as being embedded in higher-dimensional Euclidean spaces can simplify problems and provide intuitive insights.

- **Differential Geometry**: The theorem assures geometers that Riemannian manifolds have concrete representations in standard spaces, allowing for the application of classical analytic and geometric tools.

- **Analysis and Topology**: Embedding theorems help in understanding the properties of manifolds by studying their images under embeddings, which can often be easier to analyze.

The Nash Embedding Theorem not only marked a significant achievement in differential geometry but also continues to influence how mathematicians and physicists conceptualize and work with complex geometric structures. Its applications extend beyond pure mathematics, impacting theoretical physics and engineering, particularly in areas involving the geometry of space and spacetime.
