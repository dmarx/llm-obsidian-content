boltzmann entropy


**ASSISTANT**

The **Boltzmann entropy** is a foundational concept in [[statistical mechanics]] that quantifies the entropy of a macroscopic system in terms of the number of microscopic configurations (or microstates) that correspond to its macroscopic state. It is mathematically expressed by the **Boltzmann formula**:

$$
S = k_B \ln \Omega
$$

where:

- $S$ is the entropy of the system,
- $k_B$ is the [[Boltzmann constant]], a physical constant that relates macroscopic and microscopic quantities,
- $\Omega$ is the number of microstates compatible with the macroscopic state of the system.

### Intuition
Boltzmann entropy links the microscopic description of a system (e.g., the specific arrangement of atoms or molecules) to its macroscopic thermodynamic properties (e.g., temperature, pressure, and volume). A **macrostate** is defined by macroscopic quantities (e.g., total energy, volume), and a **microstate** is a specific arrangement of particles that realizes this macrostate.

The term $\ln \Omega$ reflects the fact that entropy is proportional to the logarithm of the number of microstates. This logarithmic relationship ensures that entropy is an extensive quantity (i.e., scales with system size) because $\Omega$ typically scales exponentially with system size.

### Derivation of $\Omega$
The number of microstates $\Omega$ depends on how we count configurations. For example, in a classical system of $N$ particles with volume $V$ and energy $E$, $\Omega$ is often derived from integrating over the phase space:

$$
\Omega = \int \delta(H - E) \, d^{3N}q \, d^{3N}p
$$

Here:
- $H$ is the Hamiltonian of the system, encoding energy as a function of position ($q$) and momentum ($p$),
- $\delta(H - E)$ ensures only microstates with energy $E$ are counted,
- $d^{3N}q$ and $d^{3N}p$ represent the infinitesimal volume elements in the $6N$-dimensional phase space (3 dimensions each for position and momentum for $N$ particles).

In quantum systems, $\Omega$ is typically counted discretely, as the phase space is quantized.

### Connection to Thermodynamics
The Boltzmann entropy is consistent with the **second law of thermodynamics**. As a system evolves, it moves toward macrostates with a larger number of microstates ($\Omega$ increases), corresponding to higher entropy. In equilibrium, $\Omega$ (and thus $S$) is maximized.

### Example: Ideal Gas
For an ideal gas, the entropy can be derived using Boltzmann's formula. If $N$ indistinguishable particles are confined to a volume $V$ and have total energy $E$, $\Omega$ can be computed explicitly (up to factors involving $N!$ to account for indistinguishability), leading to expressions consistent with the thermodynamic entropy from the [[Gibbs entropy]] or classical thermodynamics.

### Legacy and Extensions
Boltzmann entropy plays a central role in modern statistical mechanics and underpins concepts like [[Gibbs free energy]], [[partition functions]], and [[thermodynamic potentials]]. For systems far from equilibrium, extensions like [[Gibbs entropy|Gibbs entropy generalizations]] are often used.
