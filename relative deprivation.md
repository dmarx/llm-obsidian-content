Relative Deprivation


**ASSISTANT**

**Relative deprivation** is a sociological and psychological concept referring to the experience of being deprived of something to which one believes oneself to be entitled. It’s a perception that one is worse off relative to others with whom one compares oneself. This sense of deprivation is not just about the absolute lack of resources, but rather the discrepancy between one's actual state and one's expectations or comparisons with others.

### Key Concepts

1. **Comparison Groups**: People often compare themselves to others in their social circle, workplace, or society at large. These comparisons influence their sense of satisfaction or deprivation.

2. **Expectations vs. Reality**: Relative deprivation arises when there is a gap between what people expect and what they actually have. These expectations can be based on past experiences, societal norms, or perceived entitlements.

3. **Emotional and Behavioral Responses**: The feeling of relative deprivation can lead to a range of emotional responses, such as frustration, resentment, and dissatisfaction. It can also lead to behaviors aimed at reducing the perceived gap, such as striving for better outcomes, social movements, or, in some cases, antisocial behavior.

### Mathematical Formalization

Relative deprivation can be formally expressed in terms of utility functions in economics. Suppose an individual's utility $U$ depends not only on their own income $Y_i$ but also on the average income $Y_{\text{avg}}$ of their reference group.

$$
U_i = f(Y_i, Y_{\text{avg}})
$$

A common functional form used in the literature is:

$$
U_i = Y_i - \theta (Y_{\text{avg}} - Y_i)
$$

where:
- $Y_i$ is the income of individual $i$.
- $Y_{\text{avg}}$ is the average income of the reference group.
- $\theta$ (where $0 < \theta < 1$) is a parameter indicating the sensitivity to relative deprivation.

In this model, $U_i$ decreases as the gap $(Y_{\text{avg}} - Y_i)$ increases, reflecting greater relative deprivation.

### Empirical Studies and Applications

1. **Sociological Research**: Studies on social movements, such as those by Gurr (1970), suggest that relative deprivation can be a powerful motivator for collective action and social change.

2. **Economic Inequality**: Research in behavioral economics, such as the work by Easterlin (1974) on the Easterlin Paradox, shows that people's happiness is influenced more by their relative income compared to others than by their absolute income.

3. **Public Health**: Wilkinson and Pickett (2009) in "The Spirit Level" argue that societies with higher income inequality tend to have worse health outcomes, partly due to the stress and social tensions induced by relative deprivation.

### Practical Implications

1. **Policy Design**: Understanding relative deprivation can help in designing policies that not only aim at improving absolute living standards but also address inequalities and manage expectations. For example, progressive taxation and social welfare programs can mitigate feelings of relative deprivation.

2. **Workplace Management**: Employers can improve employee satisfaction by ensuring equitable compensation and recognition practices, reducing the potential for relative deprivation among employees.

3. **Social Programs**: Initiatives that promote social cohesion and reduce visible inequalities can alleviate the adverse effects of relative deprivation. Community-building activities and public services that enhance quality of life for all segments of society are examples.

### Theoretical Frameworks

- **Runciman’s Theory of Relative Deprivation**: Runciman (1966) distinguishes between egoistic relative deprivation (feeling deprived as an individual) and fraternal relative deprivation (feeling deprived as part of a group). This distinction helps in understanding different social dynamics, such as individual versus collective responses to deprivation.

- **Equity Theory**: This theory posits that people derive satisfaction not just from their absolute outcomes but from the fairness of the distribution of resources. Relative deprivation can thus be viewed as a perceived inequity that individuals strive to correct.

By understanding the mechanisms and implications of relative deprivation, policymakers, social scientists, and organizational leaders can better address the underlying causes of dissatisfaction and promote a more equitable and harmonious society.
