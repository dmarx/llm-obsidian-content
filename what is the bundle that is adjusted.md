what is the "bundle" that is adjusted


**ASSISTANT**

The "bundle" in "bundle adjustment" refers to the collection of sight lines (or rays) that connect each camera's optical center to the observed feature points in the environment across multiple images. Each of these sight lines is determined by the camera parameters (position and orientation) and the location of the feature points in the 3D space. Bundle adjustment involves adjusting these bundles of sight lines to achieve the best possible consistency and agreement between the observed image points and the projected points computed from the 3D model and camera setup.

Hereâ€™s a more detailed breakdown:

1. **Camera Parameters (C):** Each camera involved in the process has parameters that define its position, orientation, and internal characteristics (like focal length and optical center). These parameters dictate how a 3D point is projected onto the camera's 2D image plane.

2. **3D Points (X):** These are points in the scene whose coordinates are estimated as part of the adjustment process. They are observed from different viewpoints by the multiple cameras involved.

3. **Projection Lines:** Each 3D point is connected to each camera in which it is visible through a projection line. This line is determined by the camera parameters and the position of the point.

When all these sight lines from multiple cameras and points are considered together, they form a "bundle." In the adjustment process, both the 3D coordinates of the points and the camera parameters are altered to reduce the difference between the observed image positions of the points and the positions predicted by the camera models through these projection lines. This optimization process aims to ensure that the projection lines meet at the corresponding 3D points in space as accurately as possible, which enhances the consistency and accuracy of the 3D reconstruction.

Thus, "adjusting the bundle" means refining the estimates of both the camera parameters and the positions of the 3D points so that the projected points from different cameras align as closely as possible with their actual observed positions in the images. This approach leverages the full set of all available measurements, hence the name "bundle adjustment," reflecting the intertwined nature of the optimization of all these sight lines together.
