The **adeles** (or **adele ring**) are a key concept in modern number theory and arithmetic geometry, introduced to provide a unified framework for simultaneously handling both the global and local properties of a number field. They arise from considering completions of a number field at different places, both finite (such as $p$-adic fields) and infinite (such as real or complex numbers). The theory of adeles plays a crucial role in the study of [[automorphic forms]], the representation theory of [[algebraic groups]], and the [[Langlands program]].

### 1. **Number Fields and Local Fields**:
Before defining the adeles, we first need to recall two important types of fields:

- A **number field** $F$ is a finite extension of the field of rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$.
- A **local field** is a completion of a number field at a given place (or valuation), such as $p$-adic fields $F_v = \mathbb{Q}_p$ (finite places) or $F_\infty = \mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$ (infinite places).

For example, $\mathbb{Q}_p$ is the field of $p$-adic numbers, which is a completion of $\mathbb{Q}$ with respect to the $p$-adic norm.

### 2. **Definition of Adeles**:
The adele ring $\mathbb{A}_F$ of a number field $F$ is a restricted product of the completions of $F$ at all places (finite and infinite) of $F$. To understand this, we need to break down the construction step by step.

- Let $S_{\infty}$ be the set of infinite places of $F$ (i.e., the embeddings of $F$ into $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$).
- Let $S_f$ be the set of finite places of $F$, corresponding to the non-Archimedean valuations (often corresponding to primes in $F$).
- For each place $v$, let $F_v$ be the completion of $F$ at $v$. For finite places, these are local fields like $F_v = \mathbb{Q}_p$, and for infinite places, they could be $F_\infty = \mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$.

The adele ring $\mathbb{A}_F$ is defined as the restricted direct product of all these local fields:
$$
\mathbb{A}_F = \prod_{v \in S_f}{}' F_v \times \prod_{v \in S_\infty} F_v
$$
where the restricted product means that almost all components of a tuple $(x_v)_v \in \mathbb{A}_F$ must lie in the ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_v$ of $F_v$ for all but finitely many $v \in S_f$. In other words, for almost all finite places $v$, the elements $x_v$ must belong to a "nice" subring (the ring of integers) of $F_v$.

### 3. **Interpretation and Intuition**:
- **Finite adeles**: For finite places $v \in S_f$, the restricted product means that most elements $x_v$ belong to the local ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_v$ (which is analogous to $\mathbb{Z}_p$ for $\mathbb{Q}_p$). This condition allows us to control the size and structure of the adele ring.
  
- **Infinite adeles**: At the infinite places $v \in S_\infty$, we have the real or complex completions of $F$. The product here is unrestricted, so an adele can have arbitrary components in $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$ at the infinite places.

The adeles simultaneously encode the information from all completions of $F$, providing a single algebraic object that captures both global (number field) and local (completion) information in a unified way.

### 4. **The Ring of Adeles**:
The adele ring $\mathbb{A}_F$ is equipped with a natural **ring structure**, where addition and multiplication are defined component-wise. That is, for two adeles $a = (a_v)_v$ and $b = (b_v)_v$, their sum and product are given by:
$$
a + b = (a_v + b_v)_v, \quad a \cdot b = (a_v \cdot b_v)_v
$$
This makes $\mathbb{A}_F$ into a **topological ring**, with the product topology coming from the local fields $F_v$.

### 5. **The Group of Ideles**:
A closely related concept is the **idele group**, which is the group of invertible elements of the adele ring $\mathbb{A}_F$:
$$
\mathbb{I}_F = \prod_{v \in S_f}{}' F_v^\times \times \prod_{v \in S_\infty} F_v^\times
$$
The ideles play a significant role in class field theory, particularly in understanding the global reciprocity laws.

### 6. **Global and Local Symmetries**:
The adele ring serves as the natural domain on which automorphic forms are defined. Since automorphic forms are generalizations of modular forms, they are functions on groups like $GL(2, \mathbb{A}_F)$, where $\mathbb{A}_F$ is the ring of adeles over a number field $F$. This makes the adelic framework particularly well-suited for studying objects that exhibit both global and local behavior, like automorphic forms and their associated L-functions.

### 7. **Examples**:
Let $F = \mathbb{Q}$, the field of rational numbers. Then the adeles $\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{Q}$ are the restricted product of the local completions $\mathbb{Q}_p$ (for each prime $p$) and the reals $\mathbb{R}$:
$$
\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{Q} = \prod_{p \in \text{primes}}{}' \mathbb{Q}_p \times \mathbb{R}
$$
An element in $\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{Q}$ is a sequence $(x_p, x_\infty)$ where $x_p \in \mathbb{Q}_p$ for each prime $p$ and $x_\infty \in \mathbb{R}$, and for almost all primes $p$, $x_p$ lies in $\mathbb{Z}_p$, the $p$-adic integers.

### 8. **Importance in Modern Number Theory**:
The adele ring is a critical tool in modern number theory for several reasons:

- It allows a unified treatment of local and global aspects of number fields.
- The adelic framework is essential in the formulation of the [[Langlands program]], where automorphic representations are representations of groups like $GL(n, \mathbb{A}_F)$.
- Adeles are used in the study of zeta functions and L-functions, where one considers global functions that incorporate both finite and infinite places.
- In class field theory, ideles and the idele class group provide a powerful way of understanding abelian extensions of number fields.

In conclusion, the adeles provide a highly structured and flexible framework for addressing problems that involve both local and global properties of number fields, and they are foundational in modern approaches to [[automorphic forms]], the [[Langlands correspondence]], and [[representation theory]].
