drift diffusion model


**ASSISTANT**

The Drift Diffusion Model (DDM) is a mathematical framework used to describe decision-making processes in humans and animals. It is particularly effective in modeling two-alternative forced-choice tasks, where an individual must choose between two options based on noisy information. The DDM is a type of sequential sampling model, which assumes that decisions are made by accumulating evidence over time until a threshold is reached.

### Core Components

1. **Evidence Accumulation**: Evidence for one option over another is accumulated over time. This process is modeled as a stochastic process, typically a Wiener process with drift.
2. **Drift Rate**: The average rate at which evidence is accumulated. A higher drift rate indicates stronger and more reliable evidence for one of the choices.
3. **Decision Thresholds**: The boundaries that, when reached by the accumulated evidence, trigger a decision. There are typically two thresholds, one for each option.
4. **Starting Point**: The initial position of the evidence accumulation process, which may be biased towards one option.
5. **Non-decision Time**: The time taken for processes other than evidence accumulation, such as sensory encoding and motor response execution.

### Mathematical Formalism

The drift diffusion model is often expressed in terms of a stochastic differential equation (SDE) that describes the evolution of the evidence accumulation process $X(t)$:

$$
dX(t) = v \, dt + \sigma \, dW(t)
$$

where:
- \(X(t)\) is the evidence at time $t$.
- \(v\) is the drift rate, representing the average rate of evidence accumulation.
- \(\sigma\) is the diffusion coefficient, representing the noise in the evidence accumulation process.
- \(W(t)\) is a Wiener process (i.e., standard Brownian motion).

### Decision Process

A decision is made when the accumulated evidence $X(t)$ reaches one of the decision thresholds \(a\) or \(-a\):
- If $X(t)$ reaches $a$, option 1 is chosen.
- If $X(t)$ reaches $-a$, option 2 is chosen.

### Key Equations

1. **First-Passage Time**: The time it takes for the process to reach one of the thresholds is called the first-passage time. The distribution of the first-passage time can be derived from the properties of the Wiener process.

2. **Probability of Choosing Option 1**:
   $$
   P(\text{Option 1}) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-2va/\sigma^2}}
   $$

3. **Mean Decision Time**:
   $$
   T = \frac{a}{v} \tanh\left( \frac{va}{\sigma^2} \right) + T_{nd}
   $$
   where \( T_{nd} \) is the non-decision time.

### Applications

The DDM is widely used in cognitive psychology and neuroscience to model decision-making processes. It has been applied in various domains, including:

1. **Perceptual Decision-Making**: Tasks where participants decide between different sensory stimuli (e.g., visual or auditory signals).
2. **Economic Decisions**: Choices between different monetary gambles or consumer products.
3. **Memory Retrieval**: Decisions about whether a particular item was seen or heard before.

### Example: Perceptual Decision-Making Task

In a typical two-alternative forced-choice task, a participant is shown a stimulus and must decide as quickly as possible whether it belongs to category A or category B. The DDM can be used to model the decision-making process as follows:

1. **Evidence Accumulation**: The participant accumulates evidence over time as they process the stimulus.
2. **Drift Rate**: If the stimulus is clear and easily distinguishable, the drift rate \(v\) will be high. If the stimulus is ambiguous, the drift rate will be lower.
3. **Decision Thresholds**: The participant has internal thresholds that, when the accumulated evidence reaches, trigger a decision. Higher thresholds result in more accurate but slower decisions, while lower thresholds result in faster but less accurate decisions.
4. **Starting Point**: If the participant has a prior bias towards one of the categories, the starting point may be shifted towards the corresponding threshold.
5. **Non-decision Time**: The total reaction time includes both the decision time (modeled by the DDM) and additional time for sensory encoding and motor response.

### Visualization

A common way to visualize the DDM is through a plot of the evidence accumulation process over time:

```plaintext

```

In this diagram, the path represents the stochastic evidence accumulation process starting from the initial point. The decision is made when the path hits either the upper or lower threshold.

### Conclusion

The Drift Diffusion Model provides a powerful and flexible framework for understanding decision-making processes. By modeling the accumulation of evidence over time, it captures the dynamic nature of decision-making and allows researchers to dissect the underlying cognitive mechanisms. Its applications span a wide range of fields, making it a valuable tool in both theoretical and applied research.
