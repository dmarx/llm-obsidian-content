**USER**

Whitney's Theorem


**ASSISTANT**

**Whitney's Theorem** refers to several fundamental results in [[differential topology]] and geometry proved by Hassler Whitney. The most famous among these are the Whitney Embedding Theorem and the Whitney Immersion Theorem. These theorems provide foundational results about how smooth manifolds can be embedded or immersed in Euclidean space. 

### Whitney Embedding Theorem

The Whitney Embedding Theorem asserts that any smooth \( n \)-dimensional manifold can be embedded into a Euclidean space of dimension \( 2n \). For compact manifolds, this dimension can be reduced to \( 2n - 1 \).

#### Statement

**Theorem (Whitney Embedding Theorem)**:
- Any smooth \( n \)-dimensional manifold \( M \) can be embedded in \( \mathbb{R}^{2n} \).
- If \( M \) is compact, it can be embedded in \( \mathbb{R}^{2n-1} \).

### Whitney Immersion Theorem

The Whitney Immersion Theorem states that any smooth \( n \)-dimensional manifold can be immersed into Euclidean space of dimension \( 2n - 1 \). An immersion is a smooth map whose differential is injective at every point.

#### Statement

**Theorem (Whitney Immersion Theorem)**:
- Any smooth \( n \)-dimensional manifold \( M \) can be immersed in \( \mathbb{R}^{2n - 1} \).

### Key Concepts

1. **Smooth Manifold**: A manifold \( M \) is a topological space that locally resembles Euclidean space and has a smooth structure, meaning it has a collection of charts that smoothly transition between each other.
2. **Embedding**: A smooth map \( f: M \to \mathbb{R}^N \) is an [[embedding]] if it is injective, its differential \( df \) is injective at each point, and \( f \) is a homeomorphism onto its image.
3. **Immersion**: A smooth map \( f: M \to \mathbb{R}^N \) is an immersion if its differential \( df \) is injective at each point, but \( f \) itself does not have to be injective.

### Examples and Applications

#### Example of Embedding

Consider a 2-dimensional torus \( T^2 \). According to the Whitney Embedding Theorem, \( T^2 \) can be embedded in \( \mathbb{R}^4 \). In fact, \( T^2 \) can also be embedded in \( \mathbb{R}^3 \), which is more than sufficient for the theorem.

#### Example of Immersion

The Whitney Immersion Theorem tells us that a 2-dimensional surface, like a sphere \( S^2 \), can be immersed in \( \mathbb{R}^3 \). This is indeed the case, as we commonly see spheres in three-dimensional space.

### Proof Outline

The proofs of Whitney's Theorems are intricate and involve several advanced techniques from [[differential topology]]. Here is a high-level outline of the approach used for the Whitney Embedding Theorem:

1. **Local Charts**: Start by covering the manifold \( M \) with a finite number of local charts, each diffeomorphic to \( \mathbb{R}^n \).
2. **Local Embeddings**: Use the fact that locally, any smooth \( n \)-dimensional manifold can be embedded in \( \mathbb{R}^{2n} \).
3. **Partition of Unity**: Construct a global [[embedding]] by patching together the local embeddings using a [[partition of unity]].
4. **Transversality**: Apply the Transversality Theorem to ensure that the constructed map is an [[embedding]].

### Applications

1. **Geometry and Topology**: Whitney's Theorems are foundational in understanding the structure of manifolds and their embeddings in Euclidean space.
2. **Physics**: In theoretical physics, particularly in general relativity, manifolds represent spacetime, and their embeddings help visualize complex geometries.
3. **Robotics**: Configuration spaces of robotic systems, which are manifolds, can be studied using embeddings and immersions to understand feasible movements and states.
4. **Computer Graphics and Visualization**: Embeddings are used to visualize high-dimensional data in lower-dimensional spaces, aiding in data analysis and interpretation.

### Conclusion

Whitney's Theorems provide powerful tools for understanding the structure and properties of smooth manifolds by [[embedding]] or immersing them into Euclidean spaces. These results are cornerstones of [[differential topology]] and have broad applications across mathematics, physics, and engineering. For further study, refer to [[Differential Topology]], [[Manifold Theory]], and [[Transversality Theorem]].
