### Root System

A **root system** is a fundamental concept in the study of semisimple Lie algebras and Lie groups. It provides a powerful framework for understanding the structure and classification of these algebraic objects. Root systems arise naturally from the action of a Cartan subalgebra on the Lie algebra.

### Definition

A **root system** $\Delta$ in a Euclidean space $V$ with an inner product $(\cdot, \cdot)$ is a finite set of non-zero vectors (called roots) that satisfy the following properties:

1. **Symmetry**: If $\alpha \in \Delta$, then $-\alpha \in \Delta$.
2. **Root Reflection**: For any root $\alpha \in \Delta$, the reflection $\sigma_\alpha$ defined by
   $$ \sigma_\alpha(\beta) = \beta - 2 \frac{(\beta, \alpha)}{(\alpha, \alpha)} \alpha $$
   maps $\Delta$ to itself (i.e., $\sigma_\alpha(\Delta) \subseteq \Delta$).
3. **Integer Coefficients**: For any $\alpha, \beta \in \Delta$, the quantity $2 \frac{(\beta, \alpha)}{(\alpha, \alpha)}$ is an integer.

### Example

Consider the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}(3, \mathbb{C})$ (the algebra of $3 \times 3$ complex matrices with trace zero). A Cartan subalgebra $\mathfrak{h}$ can be chosen as the set of diagonal matrices with trace zero. The roots can be identified with the differences of the eigenvalues of these matrices.

#### Cartan Subalgebra

The Cartan subalgebra $\mathfrak{h}$ consists of diagonal matrices of the form
$$ H = \begin{pmatrix} h_1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & h_2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & h_3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad h_1 + h_2 + h_3 = 0. $$

#### Roots

The roots for $\mathfrak{sl}(3, \mathbb{C})$ are given by $\alpha_{ij}(H) = h_i - h_j$ for $1 \leq i \neq j \leq 3$. Thus, the root system $\Delta$ consists of the six vectors $\{ \pm (e_i - e_j) \mid 1 \leq i \neq j \leq 3 \}$, where $e_i$ are the standard basis vectors in $\mathbb{R}^3$.

### Root Space Decomposition

Given a Cartan subalgebra $\mathfrak{h}$ of a semisimple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, the Lie algebra decomposes into root spaces as follows:
$$ \mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{h} \oplus \bigoplus_{\alpha \in \Delta} \mathfrak{g}_\alpha, $$
where $\mathfrak{g}_\alpha = \{ X \in \mathfrak{g} \mid [H, X] = \alpha(H) X \text{ for all } H \in \mathfrak{h} \}$.

### Dynkin Diagrams

Dynkin diagrams provide a graphical representation of root systems. Each node represents a simple root, and the edges between nodes encode the angles and relative lengths between these roots. Dynkin diagrams are instrumental in the classification of simple Lie algebras.

#### Example

The root system of $\mathfrak{sl}(3, \mathbb{C})$ corresponds to the Dynkin diagram of type $A_2$:
```
  o---o
```
This diagram represents the two simple roots $\alpha_1 = e_1 - e_2$ and $\alpha_2 = e_2 - e_3$.

### Classification of Semisimple Lie Algebras

Root systems classify semisimple Lie algebras. The classification involves identifying all possible root systems, which correspond to the following types of Dynkin diagrams: $A_n$, $B_n$, $C_n$, $D_n$, $E_6$, $E_7$, $E_8$, $F_4$, and $G_2$.

### Applications

#### Representation Theory

In representation theory, root systems help in understanding how representations decompose into weight spaces. Each weight corresponds to an eigenvalue of the Cartan subalgebra acting on the representation space.

#### Geometry and Physics

In geometry and physics, root systems describe symmetries and invariants. For example, in string theory and conformal field theory, the symmetries of certain models are governed by Lie algebras and their root systems.
