## Conclusion

The **Military Decision-Making Process (MDMP)** is a vital tool in military operations, providing a structured and systematic approach to planning and decision-making. By following the steps of the MDMP, commanders and their staff can develop well-informed, feasible, and effective plans that align with the mission objectives and the commander’s intent. The MDMP enhances coordination, improves situational awareness, and ensures flexibility and adaptability in the face of changing conditions, ultimately contributing to the success of military operations.

detailed operation order (OPORD)


**ASSISTANT**

An **Operation Order (OPORD)** is a detailed directive issued by a military commander to subordinate commanders for the purpose of coordinating and executing a military operation. The OPORD outlines the mission, intent, tasks, and administrative and logistical arrangements necessary to achieve the objectives of the operation. It is a fundamental tool in military operations, providing clear and concise instructions that enable coordinated action across all levels of command.

## Purpose of an Operation Order (OPORD)

1. **Communicate the Plan**: Clearly convey the commander’s plan, intent, and specific instructions to subordinate units to ensure they understand their roles and responsibilities.
2. **Ensure Unity of Effort**: Align the actions of all units towards a common objective, ensuring coordinated and synchronized efforts.
3. **Facilitate Command and Control**: Provide a framework for decision-making and adjustments during the operation, enabling commanders to exercise command and control effectively.
4. **Clarify Tasks and Responsibilities**: Specify the tasks assigned to each subordinate unit, including objectives, timing, and resources, to prevent confusion and ensure mission success.
5. **Support Adaptability**: Include contingency plans, branches, and sequels to prepare for changes in the operational environment, allowing for flexibility and adaptability.

## Structure of an Operation Order (OPORD)

An OPORD typically follows a standardized five-paragraph format to ensure clarity and completeness. These paragraphs cover all aspects of the operation, from the mission and situation to execution, logistics, and command and control. The five-paragraph structure includes:

1. **Situation**
2. **Mission**
3. **Execution**
4. **Sustainment (formerly Service Support)**
5. **Command and Signal**

### 1. **Situation**

The **Situation** paragraph provides an overview of the operational environment and includes relevant information about the enemy, friendly forces, terrain, weather, and civil considerations.

- **Enemy Forces**: Describes the enemy's composition, disposition, strength, capabilities, and likely [[courses of action]]. This section also includes any enemy vulnerabilities and recent activities that may affect the operation.
  
- **Friendly Forces**: Describes the friendly forces involved in the operation, including higher headquarters’ mission, intent, and [[concept of operations]]. This section also includes the missions of adjacent units and any supporting units.

- **Attachments and Detachments**: Lists any units or elements attached to or detached from the main force, including their roles and responsibilities.

- **Terrain and Weather**: Describes the terrain and weather conditions that could affect the operation. This may include key terrain features, avenues of approach, obstacles, and the impact of weather on movement and visibility.

- **Civil Considerations**: Addresses the presence and potential impact of civilian populations, infrastructure, and other factors that could influence the operation. This includes rules of engagement (ROE), cultural considerations, and any humanitarian concerns.

### 2. **Mission**

The **Mission** paragraph provides a clear and concise statement of the operation’s purpose and objectives. It answers the “who, what, where, when, and why” of the operation.

- **Mission Statement**: A brief statement that specifies the unit conducting the operation (who), the task to be accomplished (what), the location (where), the time (when), and the purpose (why).

**Example**: “The 1st Battalion will seize Objective Bravo (grid location XYZ123) no later than 0600 hours to deny the enemy use of the key terrain and enable the advance of the 2nd Brigade.”

### 3. **Execution**

The **Execution** paragraph outlines how the commander intends to accomplish the mission. It includes the [[concept of operations]], tasks to subordinate units, coordinating instructions, and key tasks.

- **Commander’s Intent**: A clear statement of the desired end state and purpose of the operation. The commander’s intent provides overarching guidance and helps subordinates understand the broader goals of the operation.

- **Concept of Operations**: A detailed description of how the operation will be conducted, including the scheme of maneuver and fire support plan. It outlines the main and supporting efforts and describes the overall approach to achieving the mission objectives.

  **Subsections of the Concept of Operations**:
  - **Scheme of Maneuver**: Describes the general movement and actions of the forces to achieve the mission. This includes the main effort (the primary unit responsible for achieving the objective), supporting efforts, phases of the operation, and timing of actions.
  - **Fires**: Details the use of fire support, including artillery, air support, and other indirect fires. It outlines the allocation of fire support assets, targets, and fire support coordination measures (FSCMs).

- **Tasks to Subordinate Units**: Specifies the tasks assigned to each subordinate unit. These tasks are directive and detail what each unit must accomplish to support the overall mission.

  **Example**:
  - **Alpha Company**: Seize Objective Alpha and establish a defensive position to protect the battalion’s flank.
  - **Bravo Company**: Support Alpha Company’s advance by providing suppressive fire and secure the main supply route (MSR) to Objective Bravo.

- **Coordinating Instructions**: Includes instructions that apply to two or more units and are necessary for synchronization and coordination. This section may cover timelines, boundaries, control measures, and rules of engagement (ROE).

  **Example**:
  - **Timeline**: All units must be in position NLT (no later than) 0530 hours.
  - **Phase Lines**: Phase Line Red is the limit of advance for Alpha Company until Objective Alpha is secured.

### 4. **Sustainment**

The **Sustainment** paragraph outlines the logistical and administrative arrangements necessary to support the operation. This includes information on supply, transportation, medical support, maintenance, and personnel services.

- **Logistics**: Describes the supply and resupply plans, including classes of supply (e.g., food, ammunition, fuel), resupply points, distribution methods, and priorities for supply.

  **Example**:
  - **Class III (Fuel)**: Resupply point established at grid ABC123, operating from 0600 to 1800 hours.
  - **Class V (Ammunition)**: Units will draw initial ammunition loads from the forward supply point and resupply every 12 hours.

- **Transportation**: Provides details on transportation assets and plans, including the movement of troops, equipment, and supplies.

  **Example**:
  - **Movement Control**: 2nd Transportation Company will coordinate all convoy movements along MSR Blue. Convoys will depart every 4 hours.

- **Medical Evacuation (MEDEVAC)**: Describes the medical support plan, including casualty evacuation (CASEVAC) routes, treatment facilities, and medical units.
