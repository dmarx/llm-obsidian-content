**USER**

enumerate dark patterns


**ASSISTANT**

The user is asking me to enumerate dark patterns. Given the context that this is for a technical wiki and they want detailed, technical explanations, I should provide a comprehensive enumeration of dark patterns with their formal characteristics. I should organize this systematically and provide mathematical or formal descriptions where relevant.

Let me think about how to structure this - I could organize by category (deceptive, coercive, etc.) or alphabetically, or by mechanism. Given this is a wiki entry, I think a structured categorical approach would be most useful.

I should also remember to use the double bracket notation for novel terms and provide technical depth appropriate for someone with graduate degrees in applied math, statistics, and philosophy of science.# Enumeration of Dark Patterns

A comprehensive taxonomy of **dark patterns** organized by their primary [[manipulation mechanisms]] and formal behavioral characteristics.

## Coercive Patterns

### Forced Continuity
**Formal Definition**: Let $S = \{trial, subscription, cancellation\}$ be the state space. The transition probability matrix violates user preferences:
$$P(subscription | trial) > P^*_{user}(subscription | trial)$$
where $P^*_{user}$ represents the user's intended transition probabilities.

**Mechanism**: Automatic enrollment with high [[switching costs]] for cancellation.

### Roach Motel
**Mathematical Characterization**: Asymmetric transition costs where:
$$\frac{c(exit)}{c(enter)} \gg 1$$

Common implementations include complex cancellation procedures and buried unsubscribe mechanisms.

### Hard to Cancel
**Formalization**: Let $\tau_{cancel}$ be the time cost of cancellation. A hard-to-cancel pattern satisfies:
$$\tau_{cancel} > k \cdot \tau_{subscribe}$$
where $k \gg 1$ represents an unreasonable cost multiplier.

## Deceptive Patterns

### Bait and Switch
**Set-Theoretic Definition**: Let $O_{promised}$ and $O_{delivered}$ be outcome sets. Bait and switch occurs when:
$$O_{delivered} \cap O_{promised} = \emptyset \text{ or } |O_{delivered} \cap O_{promised}| \ll |O_{promised}|$$

### Hidden Costs
**Information Revelation Model**: Cost function $C(x)$ revealed progressively:
$$C_{revealed}(t) = \sum_{i=1}^{t} c_i \text{ where } C_{total} = \sum_{i=1}^{T} c_i$$

The [[deception parameter]] measures: $\delta = \frac{C_{total} - C_{revealed}(t_{decision})}{C_{total}}$

### Disguised Ads
**[[Signal Detection Theory]]**: False positive rate in ad identification:
$$P(classify\_as\_content | advertisement) > \epsilon$$
where $\epsilon$ represents an acceptable threshold for content-ad disambiguation.

### Fake Urgency
**Temporal Manipulation Function**: 
$$U_{artificial}(t) = U_{actual}(t) \cdot \phi(t)$$
where $\phi(t) > 1$ artificially inflates perceived time pressure.

### False Hierarchy
**Preference Inversion**: Presenting options in order $\{o_1, o_2, o_3\}$ where:
$$o_1 \succ_{designer} o_2 \succ_{designer} o_3 \text{ but } o_3 \succ_{user} o_2 \succ_{user} o_1$$

## Social Engineering Patterns

### Social Proof Manipulation
**[[Bandwagon Effect]] Amplification**: Reported adoption rate $\hat{p}$ differs from true rate $p$:
$$\hat{p} = p + \epsilon \text{ where } \epsilon > 0$$

### Activity Notifications
**[[Intermittent Reinforcement]]**: Notification timing follows variable ratio schedule to maximize [[dopamine]] response and habit formation.

### Friend Spam
**[[Network Effect]] Exploitation**: Leveraging [[social graph]] connectivity:
$$P(adoption | friend\_invitation) > P(adoption | direct\_marketing)$$

### Testimonials of Uncertain Origin
**[[Credibility]] Manipulation**: Source credibility function $\xi(s)$ obscured or fabricated.

## Obstruction Patterns

### Privacy Zuckering
**Default Bias Exploitation**: Privacy settings $\mathcal{P}_{default}$ systematically favor data collection:
$$\mathbb{E}[data\_extracted | \mathcal{P}_{default}] \gg \mathbb{E}[data\_extracted | \mathcal{P}_{user\_optimal}]$$

### Price Comparison Prevention
**[[Information Asymmetry]] Enforcement**: Comparison cost $c_{compare}$ artificially inflated to prevent [[price discovery]].

### Misdirection
**[[Attention Allocation]]**: Visual hierarchy violates user's [[information seeking]] priorities through strategic use of [[salience]] and [[visual prominence]].

### Trick Questions
**[[Cognitive Load]]**: Question phrasing exploits [[dual-process theory]] by overwhelming [[System 2]] processing, defaulting to [[System 1]] heuristics.

## Sneaking Patterns

### Sneak into Basket
**Transaction Set Manipulation**: Cart contents $\mathcal{C}_{final} \neq \mathcal{C}_{intended}$ through undisclosed additions.

### Recurring Charges
**[[Temporal Framing]]**: Subscription cost presented as $\frac{C_{total}}{n}$ where $n$ represents an artificially small time unit.

### Hidden Subscription
**State Transition Opacity**: User believes they're making one-time purchase but system transitions to subscription state without explicit consent.

## Interface Interference Patterns

### Confirm-shaming
**[[Loss Aversion]] Manipulation**: Rejection option framed as loss:
$$U(reject | loss\_frame) < U(reject | neutral\_frame)$$

### Intermediate Currency
**[[Mental Accounting]] Exploitation**: Introduction of tokens/points to obscure real monetary value and exploit [[payment depreciation]].

### Forced Registration
**[[Sunk Cost Fallacy]]**: Registration requirement creates investment $I > 0$ that influences subsequent decisions.

### Basket Sneaking
**Attention Redirection**: Additional items added during checkout when cognitive resources are depleted.

## Temporal Manipulation Patterns

### Limited Time Offers
**[[Scarcity Principle]]**: Artificial time constraints where:
$$\lim_{t \to deadline} P(purchase) = 1$$
regardless of actual product value.

### Countdown Timers
**Psychological Pressure Function**: 
$$P_{purchase}(t) = P_{baseline} \cdot e^{\alpha(T-t)}$$
where $T$ is displayed deadline and $\alpha > 0$ amplifies urgency.

### Flash Sales
**[[Availability Heuristic]]**: Perceived value inflation through temporal scarcity simulation.

## Monetary Patterns

### Bait Pricing
**[[Anchoring Bias]]**: Initial price $p_1$ serves as cognitive anchor, making adjusted price $p_2$ appear favorable even when $p_2 > p_{fair}$.

### Subscription Complexity
**[[Cognitive Overload]]**: Pricing structure complexity $\mathcal{C}$ designed to exceed user's analytical capacity:
$$\mathcal{C} > \mathcal{C}_{threshold}$$

### Drip Pricing
**[[Partitioned Pricing]]**: Total cost revelation follows function:
$$C_{revealed}(t) = C_{base} + \sum_{i=1}^{n(t)} fee_i$$
where $n(t)$ increases throughout the purchasing process.

## Engagement Maximization Patterns

### Infinite Scroll
**[[Variable Ratio Reinforcement]]**: Content reward schedule designed to maximize time-on-platform through unpredictable positive stimuli.

### Autoplay
**[[Default Effect]]**: Passive consumption as default state, exploiting user [[inertia]].

### Read Receipts Pressure
**[[Social Obligation]]**: Information asymmetry in communication status creates artificial social pressure.

### Streaks
**[[Commitment Escalation]]**: Progress investment creates [[sunk cost]] psychology and [[loss aversion]] around breaking patterns.

## Data Extraction Patterns

### Excessive Permissions
**[[Scope Creep]]**: Permission requests $\mathcal{P}_{requested} \supset \mathcal{P}_{necessary}$ for stated functionality.

### Contact Harvesting
**[[Network Effect]] Exploitation**: Social graph extraction under guise of feature enhancement.

### Location Tracking
**Spatial Privacy Erosion**: Continuous location data collection beyond functional requirements.

## Formal Detectability Metrics

### Pattern Intensity Score
$$I_{pattern} = \frac{P(intended\_outcome | pattern) - P(intended\_outcome | neutral)}{P(intended\_outcome | neutral)}$$

### User Autonomy Violation Index
$$\mathcal{V} = 1 - \frac{H(choices | pattern)}{H(choices | neutral)}$$
where $H(\cdot)$ represents [[choice entropy]].

### Manipulation Gradient
$$\nabla M = \frac{\partial P(designer\_preferred\_action)}{\partial \text{interface\_parameter}}$$

## Detection Algorithms

### Statistical Anomaly Detection
Using [[hypothesis testing]] for choice distribution deviations:
$$H_0: P_{observed} = P_{expected} \text{ vs. } H_1: P_{observed} \neq P_{expected}$$

### Machine Learning Classification
Feature vector $\mathbf{x} = [visual\_features, temporal\_features, behavioral\_features]$ for pattern classification using [[supervised learning]].

### Causal Inference Methods
[[Randomized controlled trials]] and [[natural experiments]] to establish causal relationships between interface elements and user behavior.
