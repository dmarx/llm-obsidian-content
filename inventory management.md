### Inventory Management

Inventory management involves overseeing the ordering, storage, and use of components that a company will use in the production of the items it sells, as well as overseeing quantities of finished products for sale. The goal is to ensure that the right amount of inventory is available at the right time and at the right cost.

#### Key Concepts

1. **Inventory Types**:
   - **Raw Materials**: Basic materials used to produce goods.
   - **Work-In-Progress (WIP)**: Items that are in the process of being manufactured.
   - **Finished Goods**: Products that are ready for sale.
   - **MRO (Maintenance, Repair, and Operations) Inventory**: Items used in support of production and maintenance.

2. **Inventory Costs**:
   - **Ordering Costs**: Costs associated with placing and receiving orders.
   - **Holding Costs**: Costs for storing inventory over time, including warehousing, insurance, and spoilage.
   - **Shortage Costs**: Costs incurred when inventory is insufficient to meet demand, leading to lost sales or production delays.

3. **Inventory Control Systems**:
   - **Periodic Review System**: Inventory levels are checked at regular intervals, and orders are placed as needed.
   - **Continuous Review System**: Inventory levels are continuously monitored, and orders are placed when stock falls below a predetermined level.

#### Theoretical Frameworks

##### 1. Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) Model
The EOQ model determines the optimal order quantity that minimizes the total inventory cost, which includes ordering and holding costs.

**Mathematical Formalization**:
Let $D$ be the annual demand, $S$ the setup or ordering cost per order, and $H$ the holding cost per unit per year. The EOQ is given by:
$$
EOQ = \sqrt{\frac{2DS}{H}}
$$
The total cost $TC$ associated with inventory management can be expressed as:
$$
TC = \frac{DS}{EOQ} + \frac{EOQ \times H}{2}
$$

##### 2. Just-In-Time (JIT) Inventory
JIT is a strategy to increase efficiency and decrease waste by receiving goods only as they are needed in the production process, thereby reducing inventory costs.

**Key Principles**:
- **Pull System**: Production is based on customer demand rather than forecasted demand.
- **Kanban**: A signaling system to trigger the movement of materials and production.

##### 3. ABC Analysis
ABC analysis categorizes inventory into three classes based on importance and value:
- **A Items**: High-value items with low frequency of sales.
- **B Items**: Moderate-value items with moderate frequency of sales.
- **C Items**: Low-value items with high frequency of sales.

**Mathematical Approach**:
The classification can be based on the Pareto principle (80/20 rule), where typically 20% of items account for 80% of the inventory value.

##### 4. Safety Stock
Safety stock is extra inventory held to mitigate the risk of stockouts caused by uncertainties in demand and supply.

**Mathematical Calculation**:
Let $\sigma_d$ be the standard deviation of demand, $L$ the [[lead time]], and $Z$ the desired service level (in terms of standard deviations). Safety stock $SS$ can be calculated as:
$$
SS = Z \cdot \sigma_d \cdot \sqrt{L}
$$

#### Applications in Various Sectors

1. **Manufacturing**: Managing raw materials, WIP, and finished goods to ensure smooth production processes.
2. **Retail**: Balancing inventory levels to meet customer demand without overstocking.
3. **Healthcare**: Ensuring the availability of medical supplies and pharmaceuticals.
4. **E-commerce**: Managing large volumes of diverse inventory to ensure timely delivery to customers.

#### Historical Examples

1. **Toyota Production System (TPS)**: Pioneered JIT inventory management, significantly reducing waste and improving efficiency.
2. **Amazon**: Uses advanced inventory management techniques, including real-time tracking and forecasting, to manage vast inventories across multiple warehouses.

#### Challenges in Inventory Management

1. **Demand Forecasting**: Accurately predicting customer demand to avoid overstocking or stockouts.
2. **Supply Chain Disruptions**: Handling unexpected disruptions in the supply chain that can affect inventory levels.
3. **Inventory Accuracy**: Ensuring that inventory records accurately reflect actual stock levels.
4. **Cost Management**: Balancing the costs associated with ordering, holding, and shortage of inventory.

#### Mathematical Models for Inventory Optimization

##### 1. Newsvendor Model
Used to determine optimal inventory levels for products with uncertain demand and a limited selling period.

**Mathematical Formulation**:
Let $c$ be the cost per unit, $p$ the selling price per unit, $h$ the holding cost per unit, and $D$ the random demand variable with probability distribution $F$. The objective is to determine the order quantity $Q$ that maximizes expected profit:
$$
\max_Q \left[ p \cdot \mathbb{E}[\min(D, Q)] - c \cdot Q - h \cdot \mathbb{E}[\max(Q - D, 0)] \right]
$$

##### 2. Multi-Echelon Inventory Optimization
Involves optimizing inventory across multiple levels of a supply chain, considering the interdependencies between different echelons (e.g., suppliers, manufacturers, distributors).

**Mathematical Formulation**:
The objective is to minimize the total cost across the supply chain while meeting service level requirements. This often involves complex algorithms and simulation techniques.

#### Conclusion

Inventory management is crucial for optimizing the flow of goods and services within an organization. By applying key principles and mathematical models, businesses can achieve a balance between having sufficient inventory to meet demand and minimizing costs associated with holding and ordering inventory. Effective inventory management leads to improved efficiency, customer satisfaction, and overall operational success.
