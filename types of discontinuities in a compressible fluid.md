types of discontinuities in a compressible fluid


**ASSISTANT**

In [[compressible fluid dynamics]], various types of discontinuities can occur, representing abrupt changes in the fluid's properties such as pressure, density, velocity, and temperature. These discontinuities are often associated with nonlinear phenomena where standard linear analysis fails to apply. Understanding these discontinuities is crucial for analyzing and predicting the behavior of high-speed flows, such as those encountered in aerodynamics, astrophysics, and explosive dynamics.

### 1. Shock Waves
Shock waves are the most well-known type of discontinuity in compressible fluids. They represent a sudden, nearly instantaneous change in fluid properties across a very thin region, typically only a few molecular mean free paths thick.

- **Characteristics**:
  - **Pressure, Temperature, and Density Increase**: Across a shock wave, the pressure, temperature, and density of the fluid increase abruptly.
  - **Velocity Decrease**: The fluid velocity decreases as it passes through the shock wave, transitioning from supersonic to subsonic speeds in the case of a normal shock.
  - **Irreversibility**: The process is highly irreversible, leading to an increase in entropy.

- **Types**:
  - **Normal Shock Waves**: The shock front is perpendicular to the flow direction.
  - **Oblique Shock Waves**: The shock front is inclined relative to the flow direction.
  - **Bow Shocks**: Formed in front of blunt bodies moving at supersonic speeds, with the shock wave detaching from the object's surface.

### 2. Contact Discontinuities
A contact discontinuity is a type of discontinuity where the pressure and velocity are continuous across the boundary, but the density and temperature may change abruptly.

- **Characteristics**:
  - **Pressure and Velocity Continuity**: Unlike [[shock waves]], both pressure and velocity remain constant across a contact discontinuity.
  - **Density and Temperature Discontinuity**: The primary feature is a discontinuous jump in density and temperature, while the pressure stays the same.
  - **No Shock Formation**: There is no compression shock associated with [[contact discontinuities]].
  - **Entropy Discontinuity**: Since temperature changes while pressure remains constant, there is a corresponding change in entropy across the discontinuity.

- **Examples**:
  - Occurs in stratified layers of fluid, such as the interface between different air masses in the atmosphere.

### 3. Expansion Waves
An expansion wave, or expansion fan, is not a discontinuity in the traditional sense but represents a smooth, continuous change in fluid properties. However, it is often discussed alongside [[shock waves]] because it also represents a significant change in flow conditions.

- **Characteristics**:
  - **Decreasing Pressure, Density, and Temperature**: As the fluid passes through the expansion wave, these properties decrease smoothly.
  - **Velocity Increase**: The fluid accelerates, with the velocity increasing as it passes through the expansion fan.
  - **Isentropic Process**: Unlike [[shock waves]], expansion waves are typically isentropic, meaning that entropy remains constant.

- **Examples**:
  - Occurs when supersonic flow expands around a convex corner, such as the expansion of gases in a nozzle.

### 4. Slip Lines
A slip line is a discontinuity in velocity that occurs in fluid flow, often associated with shear layers between two fluid streams moving at different velocities.

- **Characteristics**:
  - **Discontinuous Velocity**: The velocity component tangential to the discontinuity changes abruptly across the slip line.
  - **Continuous Pressure and Normal Velocity**: Pressure and the velocity component normal to the slip line are continuous across the boundary.
  - **No Change in Density and Temperature**: In the simplest models, density and temperature remain constant across a slip line.

- **Examples**:
  - Common in two-dimensional flow where two fluid streams with different velocities slide past each other without mixing.

### 5. Prandtl-Meyer Expansion Fans
The Prandtl-Meyer expansion fan is a specific type of expansion wave that occurs when a supersonic flow turns around a convex corner.

- **Characteristics**:
  - **Smooth Transition**: Unlike a shock wave, the transition in the flow properties is smooth and continuous.
  - **Acceleration**: The fluid accelerates, and the Mach number increases through the expansion fan.
  - **Decrease in Pressure, Temperature, and Density**: These properties decrease smoothly as the flow expands.

- **Examples**:
  - Often seen in the exhaust nozzles of rockets or supersonic wind tunnels, where the flow turns through an angle.

### 6. Rarefaction Waves
Rarefaction waves are another type of smooth, continuous expansion wave, where the fluid expands, leading to a decrease in density, pressure, and temperature.

- **Characteristics**:
  - **Expansion and Decrease in Properties**: The fluid expands, and its pressure, density, and temperature decrease as it passes through the wave.
  - **Velocity Increase**: Similar to [[expansion fans]], the fluid accelerates as it expands.
  - **Isentropic Process**: The process is often isentropic, with no entropy increase.

- **Examples**:
  - Occurs naturally in the rarefied regions behind [[shock waves]] in explosions or in the unsteady expansion of gases.

### 7. Detached Shocks
As described earlier, detached shocks are [[shock waves]] that do not attach directly to the surface of the object but instead form a bow-like structure in front of it.

- **Characteristics**:
  - **Subsonic Region Behind the Shock**: The region between the shock and the object often has subsonic flow, even if the flow ahead of the shock is supersonic.
  - **High Pressure and Temperature**: Significant increases in pressure and temperature occur behind the shock wave.
  - **Standoff Distance**: The distance between the shock wave and the object’s surface, depending on the object’s shape and the Mach number.

- **Examples**:
  - Common in supersonic and hypersonic flight, such as in the [[shock waves]] formed in front of re-entry vehicles.

### Conclusion

In [[compressible fluid dynamics]], discontinuities play a crucial role in determining the behavior of high-speed flows. Shock waves, [[contact discontinuities]], expansion waves, [[slip lines]], and related phenomena like detached shocks and [[rarefaction waves]] all represent different forms of abrupt or smooth transitions in the flow field. Understanding these discontinuities is essential for analyzing and predicting the complex behavior of compressible flows in various engineering and scientific applications.
