### Superadditivity in Cooperative Games

**Superadditivity** is a crucial property in [[cooperative game theory]] that describes the potential synergy between coalitions. It essentially states that the value of a combined coalition is at least as large as the sum of the values of the individual coalitions.

#### Definition

A cooperative game $(N, v)$ is **superadditive** if for any two disjoint coalitions $S$ and $T$ (i.e., $S \cap T = \emptyset$), the characteristic function $v$ satisfies:
$$ v(S \cup T) \geq v(S) + v(T). $$

This property implies that players have an incentive to cooperate because forming larger coalitions will not decrease their combined payoff.

#### Interpretation

Superadditivity ensures that the value generated by merging two coalitions is at least the sum of their individual values, reflecting the idea that cooperation is beneficial. This is foundational in [[cooperative game theory]] as it aligns with the concept of creating surplus through collaboration.

#### Example

Consider a simple cooperative game with three players $N = \{1, 2, 3\}$ and a characteristic function defined as:
$$
\begin{align*}
v(\{1\}) & = 10, \\
v(\{2\}) & = 20, \\
v(\{3\}) & = 30, \\
v(\{1, 2\}) & = 40, \\
v(\{1, 3\}) & = 50, \\
v(\{2, 3\}) & = 60, \\
v(\{1, 2, 3\}) & = 80.
\end{align*}
$$

To check superadditivity, we verify that for all disjoint coalitions $S$ and $T$:
- $v(\{1, 2\}) \geq v(\{1\}) + v(\{2\}) \implies 40 \geq 10 + 20$
- $v(\{1, 3\}) \geq v(\{1\}) + v(\{3\}) \implies 50 \geq 10 + 30$
- $v(\{2, 3\}) \geq v(\{2\}) + v(\{3\}) \implies 60 \geq 20 + 30$
- $v(\{1, 2, 3\}) \geq v(\{1, 2\}) + v(\{3\}) \implies 80 \geq 40 + 30$
- $v(\{1, 2, 3\}) \geq v(\{1, 3\}) + v(\{2\}) \implies 80 \geq 50 + 20$
- $v(\{1, 2, 3\}) \geq v(\{2, 3\}) + v(\{1\}) \implies 80 \geq 60 + 10$

All conditions are satisfied, hence the game is superadditive.

#### Implications

1. **Formation of the Grand Coalition**:
   Superadditivity implies that players are incentivized to form the grand coalition $N$, as the total payoff is maximized through collaboration.

2. **Core Stability**:
   Superadditive games tend to have a larger core, as there are more imputations that satisfy the efficiency and group rationality conditions.

3. **Bargaining and Negotiation**:
   In superadditive games, the negotiation process among players is facilitated by the assurance that larger coalitions yield higher or equal payoffs, promoting stability and cooperation.

#### Mathematical Formulation

For a set of players $N = \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$, and a characteristic function $v: 2^N \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, the game is superadditive if for all $S, T \subseteq N$ with $S \cap T = \emptyset$:
$$ v(S \cup T) \geq v(S) + v(T). $$

This can be extended to more than two coalitions. If $S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_k$ are mutually disjoint coalitions, then:
$$ v\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^k S_i\right) \geq \sum_{i=1}^k v(S_i). $$

#### Real-World Examples

1. **Business Mergers**:
   Companies merging often create more value together than separately due to synergies in operations, resources, and markets. For instance, two technology firms combining their research and development can innovate more effectively than working separately.

2. **Political Coalitions**:
   Political parties or factions forming alliances can achieve greater influence and policy-making power than individually, leveraging their combined voter base and resources.
