**ASSISTANT**

In the classification of symmetric spaces, we often describe these spaces as quotients of Lie groups. This notation reflects how a symmetric space can be constructed as the coset space of a Lie group \(G\) modulo a closed subgroup \(H\). Let's break down the notation for each example:

### Compact Type

#### Spheres \(S^n\)

\[ S^n = \frac{\text{SO}(n+1)}{\text{SO}(n)} \]

- \( \text{SO}(n+1) \): The special orthogonal group of \((n+1) \times (n+1)\) orthogonal matrices with determinant 1. This group represents rotations in \((n+1)\)-dimensional space.
- \( \text{SO}(n) \): The special orthogonal group of \(n \times n\) orthogonal matrices with determinant 1. This group represents rotations in \(n\)-dimensional space.
- The sphere \(S^n\) can be seen as the homogeneous space formed by the quotient of \( \text{SO}(n+1) \) by \( \text{SO}(n) \), effectively representing the space of rotations that map one \(n\)-dimensional sphere into another.

#### Complex Projective Spaces \(\mathbb{C}P^n\)

\[ \mathbb{C}P^n = \frac{\text{SU}(n+1)}{\text{S}(\text{U}(n) \times \text{U}(1))} \]

- \( \text{SU}(n+1) \): The special unitary group of \((n+1) \times (n+1)\) unitary matrices with determinant 1. This group represents complex rotations and phase changes in \((n+1)\)-dimensional complex space.
- \( \text{S}(\text{U}(n) \times \text{U}(1)) \): The group consisting of pairs \((A, \lambda I)\) where \(A \in \text{U}(n)\) (the unitary group of \(n \times n\) unitary matrices) and \(\lambda \in \text{U}(1)\) (the group of complex numbers with absolute value 1), with the determinant of the whole pair being 1.
- The complex projective space \(\mathbb{C}P^n\) can be viewed as the quotient of \( \text{SU}(n+1) \) by this subgroup.

#### Grassmannians \(G_{k,n}\)

\[ G_{k,n} = \frac{\text{SO}(n)}{\text{SO}(k) \times \text{SO}(n-k)} \]

- \( \text{SO}(n) \): As above, the special orthogonal group in \(n\)-dimensional space.
- \( \text{SO}(k) \times \text{SO}(n-k) \): The direct product of the special orthogonal groups of dimensions \(k\) and \(n-k\). 
- The Grassmannian \(G_{k,n}\) is the space of all \(k\)-dimensional subspaces of an \(n\)-dimensional space, represented as the quotient of \( \text{SO}(n) \) by the product group \( \text{SO}(k) \times \text{SO}(n-k) \).

### Non-Compact Type

#### Hyperbolic Spaces \(\mathbb{H}^n\)

\[ \mathbb{H}^n = \frac{\text{SO}(n,1)}{\text{SO}(n)} \]

- \( \text{SO}(n,1) \): The special orthogonal group of \(n+1\) dimensional matrices preserving a quadratic form with signature \((n,1)\), corresponding to the symmetries of \(n\)-dimensional hyperbolic space.
- \( \text{SO}(n) \): As above, representing rotations in \(n\)-dimensional space.
- The hyperbolic space \(\mathbb{H}^n\) can be described as the quotient of \( \text{SO}(n,1) \) by \( \text{SO}(n) \), representing the set of possible positions in the hyperbolic space.

#### Complex Hyperbolic Spaces \(\mathbb{C}H^n\)

\[ \mathbb{C}H^n = \frac{\text{SU}(n,1)}{\text{S}(\text{U}(n) \times \text{U}(1))} \]

- \( \text{SU}(n,1) \): The special unitary group preserving a Hermitian form of signature \((n,1)\), corresponding to the symmetries of complex hyperbolic space.
- \( \text{S}(\text{U}(n) \times \text{U}(1)) \): As in the complex projective case, but in the context of preserving the Hermitian form.
- The complex hyperbolic space \(\mathbb{C}H^n\) is represented as the quotient of \( \text{SU}(n,1) \) by \( \text{S}(\text{U}(n) \times \text{U}(1)) \), capturing the geometry of the space.

### Interpretation

In each case, the notation \(G/H\) signifies that the symmetric space is constructed as the quotient of the Lie group \(G\) by its subgroup \(H\). This representation is crucial for understanding the geometric and algebraic properties of the symmetric space, as well as its symmetries and structure.
