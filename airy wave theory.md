### Airy Wave Theory

**Airy wave theory** is a linear theory of surface [[gravity waves]] developed by George Biddell Airy in 1841. It is one of the most fundamental and widely used models in [[oceanography]], coastal engineering, and fluid dynamics for describing the behavior of waves on the surface of a fluid, such as the ocean or a lake. The theory is particularly useful for analyzing small-amplitude waves in deep and intermediate water depths, where the wave motion is assumed to be linear, meaning that the wave amplitude is small compared to the wavelength and water depth.

### Basic Assumptions of Airy Wave Theory

1. **Linearization**:
   - **Small Amplitude Waves**: The theory assumes that the wave amplitude \( a \) is small compared to the wavelength \( \lambda \) and the water depth \( h \). This allows the governing equations to be linearized, simplifying the analysis.
   - **Sinusoidal Waves**: The waves are assumed to be sinusoidal, meaning that the wave profile can be described by a simple sine or cosine function.

2. **Inviscid and Incompressible Fluid**:
   - **Inviscid Fluid**: The fluid is assumed to be inviscid, meaning that it has no viscosity. This simplifies the analysis by neglecting any effects of internal friction within the fluid.
   - **Incompressible Fluid**: The fluid is also assumed to be incompressible, meaning that its density is constant. This is a reasonable assumption for water and other liquids under typical conditions.

3. **Potential Flow**:
   - **Irrotational Flow**: The flow is assumed to be irrotational, which allows the velocity field to be expressed as the gradient of a velocity potential \( \Phi(x, z, t) \).
   - **Laplace's Equation**: The velocity potential satisfies Laplace's equation:
     $$
     \nabla^2 \Phi = \frac{\partial^2 \Phi}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 \Phi}{\partial z^2} = 0
     $$
     where \( x \) is the horizontal coordinate and \( z \) is the vertical coordinate.

### Mathematical Formulation

1. **Wave Profile**:
   - The surface elevation \( \eta(x,t) \) of a progressive wave can be described by:
     $$
     \eta(x,t) = a \cos(kx - \omega t)
     $$
     where:
     - \( a \) is the wave amplitude,
     - \( k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} \) is the wavenumber,
     - \( \omega = 2\pi f \) is the angular frequency,
     - \( x \) is the horizontal coordinate, and
     - \( t \) is time.

2. **Velocity Potential**:
   - The velocity potential \( \Phi(x,z,t) \) that describes the fluid motion under the wave is given by:
     $$
     \Phi(x,z,t) = \frac{a \omega}{k} \frac{\cosh[k(z+h)]}{\sinh(kh)} \sin(kx - \omega t)
     $$
     where \( z \) is the vertical coordinate (positive upwards, with \( z = 0 \) at the mean water level and \( z = -h \) at the seabed).

3. **Wave Dispersion Relation**:
   - The dispersion relation, which relates the wave frequency \( \omega \) to the wavenumber \( k \), is a key result of Airy wave theory:
     $$
     \omega^2 = gk \tanh(kh)
     $$
     where \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity. This equation shows how the wave speed \( c = \frac{\omega}{k} \) depends on the wavelength and the water depth.

4. **Particle Motion**:
   - **Horizontal and Vertical Velocities**: The horizontal and vertical components of the fluid particle velocity, \( u(x,z,t) \) and \( w(x,z,t) \), are given by:
     $$
     u(x,z,t) = \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial x} = a \omega \frac{\cosh[k(z+h)]}{\sinh(kh)} \cos(kx - \omega t)
     $$
     $$
     w(x,z,t) = \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial z} = a \omega \frac{\sinh[k(z+h)]}{\sinh(kh)} \sin(kx - \omega t)
     $$
   - **Orbital Motion**: Under the wave, fluid particles follow orbital paths. In deep water, these orbits are nearly circular, but in shallow water, they become more elliptical.

### Applications of Airy Wave Theory

1. **Wave Propagation**:
   - **Deep Water Waves**: For deep water waves, where \( h \geq \lambda/2 \), the dispersion relation simplifies to \( \omega^2 = gk \), meaning that the wave speed depends on the wavelength. Longer waves travel faster than shorter ones.
   - **Shallow Water Waves**: For shallow water waves, where \( h \leq \lambda/20 \), the dispersion relation simplifies to \( \omega^2 = ghk \), meaning that the wave speed depends primarily on the water depth, and all waves travel at the same speed regardless of wavelength.

2. **Coastal Engineering**:
   - **Wave Forces on Structures**: Airy wave theory is used to calculate the forces exerted by waves on coastal structures such as breakwaters, seawalls, and piers. The theory provides estimates of wave heights, velocities, and pressures, which are critical for design and safety assessments.
   - **Wave Run-Up and Overtopping**: The theory helps predict how far waves will travel up a beach or structure, known as wave run-up, and the likelihood of waves overtopping coastal defenses.

3. **Oceanography**:
   - **Wave Prediction**: Airy wave theory is foundational for wave prediction models used in [[oceanography]]. These models help forecast wave conditions for navigation, fishing, and offshore operations.
   - **Tsunami Modeling**: For [[tsunamis]] and other long-period waves, the shallow water version of Airy wave theory can be used to estimate wave propagation speeds and potential impacts on coastlines.

4. **Environmental Science**:
   - **Sediment Transport**: The theory is used to understand sediment transport processes in coastal and riverine environments, where waves play a key role in moving sand and other materials along the seabed.
   - **Ecosystem Dynamics**: Waves influence coastal and marine ecosystems, affecting everything from the distribution of nutrients and plankton to the formation of habitats like coral reefs and sand dunes. Airy wave theory helps model these processes.

### Limitations of Airy Wave Theory

1. **Small Amplitude Assumption**:
   - **Nonlinearity Neglect**: Airy wave theory assumes that wave amplitudes are small relative to wavelength and water depth. This assumption breaks down for large waves, where nonlinear effects become significant, requiring more complex models like Stokes wave theory or the Boussinesq equations.

2. **Breaking Waves**:
   - **No Wave Breaking**: The theory does not account for [[wave breaking]], which occurs when the wave steepness exceeds a critical value. Wave breaking is a nonlinear process and cannot be described by linear theory.

3. **Shallow Water Limitations**:
   - **Inapplicability to Very Shallow Water**: While Airy wave theory can describe shallow water waves, it becomes less accurate in extremely shallow conditions where nonlinear effects dominate, and waves behave more like bores or solitary waves.

4. **Energy Dissipation**:
   - **No Dissipation**: Airy wave theory assumes that waves do not lose energy as they propagate. In reality, waves can dissipate energy due to factors like bottom friction, viscosity, and [[wave breaking]], which are not captured by the theory.

### Conclusion

**Airy wave theory** provides a foundational framework for understanding and predicting the behavior of small-amplitude surface [[gravity waves]] in deep and intermediate water depths. Its simplicity and applicability to a wide range of wave phenomena make it an essential tool in [[oceanography]], coastal engineering, and environmental science. Despite its limitations, particularly in the presence of strong nonlinearity or breaking waves, Airy wave theory remains a crucial starting point for analyzing wave motion in many practical applications. When more accuracy is required, particularly for large or breaking waves, more advanced theories can be applied, building on the fundamental concepts established by Airy.
