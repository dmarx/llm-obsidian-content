Autonomous agency theory

### Autonomous Agency Theory (AAT)

**Autonomous Agency Theory (AAT)** is a framework for understanding and modeling autonomous systems as self-organizing, self-regulating, and adaptive entities. It extends principles from [[systems theory]], [[cybernetics]], and [[complex adaptive systems]] to describe how agents (biological, artificial, or social) maintain their autonomy while interacting dynamically with their environments.

Autonomous systems in this framework are defined by their ability to self-maintain, adapt to changes, and evolve goals or rules that govern their behavior. The theory highlights processes such as **autopoiesis** (self-production), autonomy, and **structural coupling** with the environment.

### Key Principles of Autonomous Agency Theory

1. **Autonomy**
   - Autonomy is the ability of an agent to determine its own behavior and maintain its identity while interacting with its environment.
   - Autonomous agents exhibit self-regulation, decision-making, and the ability to act independently of external control.

2. **Self-Organization**
   - AAT emphasizes the capacity of agents to self-organize, creating internal order without explicit external guidance. This process is crucial for maintaining coherence and functionality in complex environments.

3. **Adaptability**
   - Autonomous agents must adapt their behavior and internal structures to cope with changes in their environment. This includes learning and evolving in response to new conditions or challenges.

4. **Structural Coupling**
   - An autonomous agent interacts dynamically with its environment through a process called **structural coupling**, where the agent and environment influence each other while maintaining their distinct identities.
   - This interaction ensures that the agent remains viable and responsive to external changes.

5. **Emergence**
   - Higher-order behaviors and patterns emerge from the interactions between autonomous agents and their environments. Emergence is a hallmark of complex systems.

### Core Components of Autonomous Systems in AAT

AAT models autonomous systems as comprising three interdependent domains:

1. **Operational Domain**
   - Describes the internal mechanisms and processes that sustain the agent's operations. This includes metabolic functions in biological systems or computational processes in artificial systems.

2. **Cognitive Domain**
   - Encompasses perception, decision-making, and learning. Agents construct models of their environment to guide their behavior and make predictions about future states.

3. **Social Domain**
   - Focuses on the interactions between agents and their broader environment, including other agents. This domain highlights communication, cooperation, and competition.

### Mathematical Formalization

#### State Representation and Dynamics
An autonomous agent's state can be represented as a vector \( \mathbf{x}(t) \) evolving in time:
$$
\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = f(\mathbf{x}(t), \mathbf{u}(t), \mathbf{e}(t)),
$$
where:
- \( \mathbf{x}(t) \): State vector of the agent at time \( t \).
- \( \mathbf{u}(t) \): Control inputs determined by the agent.
- \( \mathbf{e}(t) \): Environmental inputs affecting the agent.
- \( f \): Governing function encoding the dynamics of the system.

#### Adaptation and Goal Evolution
AAT incorporates the notion that an agent's governing rules \( f \) and goals \( \mathbf{g} \) can evolve:
$$
f_{t+1} = h(f_t, \mathbf{x}_t, \mathbf{e}_t),
$$
where \( h \) defines how the agent's internal dynamics adapt based on interactions with the environment.

### Applications of Autonomous Agency Theory

1. **Artificial Intelligence and Robotics**
   - Designing autonomous robots and AI systems that can learn, adapt, and act independently in dynamic environments.
   - Examples include self-driving cars, autonomous drones, and conversational AI.

2. **Biological Systems**
   - Modeling organisms as autonomous agents to study phenomena like [[homeostasis]], evolution, and ecological interactions.

3. **Social and Organizational Systems**
   - Analyzing human organizations as networks of autonomous agents to improve decision-making, resilience, and adaptability.
   - Example: Decentralized governance in blockchain systems.

4. **Economics**
   - Modeling markets and economies as collections of autonomous agents interacting through competition, cooperation, and resource exchanges.

5. **Ecosystems**
   - Viewing species and ecological entities as autonomous agents interacting dynamically with their environments and co-evolving over time.

### Connections to Related Theories

- **Autopoiesis**: AAT builds on the idea of self-production, describing how autonomous agents sustain their identity and adapt through internal processes.
- **Viable System Theory**: Extends principles of system viability to focus on individual autonomy within larger systems.
- **Complex Adaptive Systems**: Shares AAT's emphasis on self-organization, emergence, and adaptation.
- **Second-Order Cybernetics**: Aligns with AAT by recognizing the role of reflexivity and self-reference in autonomous behavior.
