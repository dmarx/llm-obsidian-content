### Residual Entropy

**Residual entropy** is a measure of the remaining uncertainty or randomness in a system or dataset after accounting for known structure, patterns, or constraints. It quantifies the amount of information that cannot be reduced or explained by models or prior knowledge, reflecting the "irreducible" randomness of a system.

---

### **Formal Definition**

Residual entropy arises in various contexts, including statistical mechanics, [[Information Theory]], and machine learning. Its precise meaning depends on the domain, but the unifying idea is the entropy that remains after considering constraints or structure.

#### **1. General Definition in Information Theory**

Given a dataset or random variable \( X \), and a model or set of constraints \( M \), the **residual entropy** is the conditional entropy:
$$
H(X \mid M) = \mathbb{E}[-\log P(X \mid M)],
$$
where:
- \( P(X \mid M) \) is the conditional probability distribution of \( X \), given \( M \).
- \( H(X \mid M) \) represents the uncertainty in \( X \) that remains after incorporating \( M \).

#### **2. Physical Interpretation in Statistical Mechanics**

In thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, residual entropy refers to the entropy remaining in a system at absolute zero temperature due to degeneracy in the ground state. If a system has multiple microstates \( g \) consistent with its ground state, the residual entropy is:
$$
S_{\text{residual}} = k_B \ln g,
$$
where:
- \( k_B \) is Boltzmann's constant.
- \( g \) is the number of accessible microstates.

---

### **Examples**

#### **1. Dataset with Structure**

Consider a dataset \( D = \{110110\} \), and a model \( M \) that predicts \( P(1) = 0.8 \), \( P(0) = 0.2 \), and assumes independence of bits. The residual entropy is:
$$
H(D \mid M) = -\sum_{x \in D} P(x \mid M) \log P(x \mid M).
$$
Here, \( M \) explains part of the structure, but \( H(D \mid M) \) reflects the randomness of the sequence given \( M \).

#### **2. Residual Entropy in Ground-State Systems**

In ice (a disordered crystalline solid), residual entropy arises because water molecules can orient themselves in multiple ways, even at absolute zero. The residual entropy per mole of ice is:
$$
S_{\text{ice}} = R \ln \omega,
$$
where \( R \) is the gas constant, and \( \omega \) is the number of configurations per molecule.

### **Applications**

1. **Model Evaluation in Machine Learning**
   - Residual entropy reflects the uncertainty in predictions:
     $$
     H(Y \mid \hat{Y}) = -\sum_y P(Y = y \mid \hat{Y}) \log P(Y = y \mid \hat{Y}),
     $$
     where \( Y \) is the true outcome and \( \hat{Y} \) is the predicted outcome.

2. **Statistical Mechanics**
   - Residual entropy helps understand systems with degenerate ground states, such as ice, glasses, and spin systems.

3. **Data Compression**
   - In [[Minimum Description Length Principle]], residual entropy corresponds to the part of the data that cannot be compressed further by the model.

4. **Uncertainty Quantification**
   - Residual entropy is used in probabilistic models to measure the remaining uncertainty after incorporating evidence or prior knowledge.

---

### **Residual Entropy vs. Other Concepts**

1. **Shannon Entropy**
   - Shannon entropy \( H(X) \) measures the total uncertainty in \( X \). Residual entropy \( H(X \mid M) \) is the part of this uncertainty that remains unexplained by \( M \).

2. **Mutual Information**
   - The mutual information between \( X \) and \( M \) measures how much \( M \) reduces the entropy of \( X \):
     $$
     I(X; M) = H(X) - H(X \mid M).
     $$

3. **Irreducible Loss**
   - Residual entropy corresponds to the irreducible randomness or error, i.e., the part of the uncertainty that no model \( M \) can eliminate.

---

### **Mathematical Properties**

1. **Non-Negativity**
   - \( H(X \mid M) \geq 0 \): Residual entropy cannot be negative.

2. **Reduction by Models**
   - Adding more information or improving \( M \) reduces \( H(X \mid M) \), but the residual entropy is bounded below by the inherent randomness in \( X \).

3. **Additivity for Independent Variables**
   - For independent random variables \( X_1 \) and \( X_2 \):
     $$
     H(X_1, X_2 \mid M) = H(X_1 \mid M) + H(X_2 \mid M).
     $$

---

### **Residual Entropy as Irreducible Randomness**

Residual entropy quantifies the boundary between structure and randomness in a system. It reflects:
1. **What cannot be compressed** in a dataset.
2. **What cannot be predicted** by a model.
3. **What cannot be eliminated** by imposing additional constraints.

Understanding residual entropy provides insights into the complexity, uncertainty, and limits of predictability in systems ranging from datasets to physical systems.
