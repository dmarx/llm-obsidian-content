### Formal Semantics

Formal semantics is a field within [[linguistics]] and [[philosophy of language]] that uses mathematical tools to rigorously analyze the meanings of natural language expressions. It provides a formal framework to represent and interpret linguistic meaning, allowing for precise and unambiguous analysis of how language conveys information.

#### Core Concepts in Formal Semantics

1. **Syntax-Semantics Interface**
   - **Definition**: The relationship between syntactic structures and their semantic interpretations.
   - **Importance**: Ensures that the meaning of a sentence can be systematically derived from its syntactic form.
   
2. **Compositionality**
   - **Principle**: The meaning of a complex expression is determined by the meanings of its parts and the rules used to combine them.
   - **Example**: The meaning of "red ball" is derived from the meanings of "red" and "ball" and how they combine.

3. **Type Theory**
   - **Definition**: A formal system that categorizes expressions into different types to manage their combination.
   - **Basic Types**:
     - **Entities ($e$)**: Objects or individuals in the world.
     - **Truth Values ($t$)**: Representing true or false propositions.
   - **Complex Types**:
     - **Functions**: Mappings between types, e.g., $(e \rightarrow t)$ for predicates.

4. **Lambda Calculus**
   - **Definition**: A formal system for expressing functions and their application, used to represent meanings in formal semantics.
   - **Example**: $\lambda x. \text{runs}(x)$ represents a function that applies to an entity to yield a truth value.

5. **Possible Worlds Semantics**
   - **Definition**: A framework for interpreting modal expressions (possibility, necessity) and propositional attitudes (belief, desire) by considering different possible worlds.
   - **Example**: $\Box p$ means $p$ is necessarily true in all possible worlds.

#### Key Components of Formal Semantics

1. **Syntax**
   - **Phrase Structure Rules**: Rules that describe how words combine to form phrases and sentences.
   - **Example**: \( S \rightarrow NP \ VP \) means a sentence \( S \) is formed by a noun phrase \( NP \) and a verb phrase \( VP \).

2. **Semantics**
   - **Interpretation Rules**: Rules that map syntactic structures to semantic representations.
   - **Example**: The semantic rule for "John runs" might map to $\text{runs}(\text{John})$.

3. **Models**
   - **Definition**: Formal structures that interpret the meanings of expressions.
   - **Components**:
     - **Domain**: A set of entities.
     - **Interpretation Function**: Assigns meanings to expressions.
   - **Example**: A model \( \mathcal{M} \) might include a domain of individuals and an interpretation function that maps "John" to a specific individual and "runs" to a set of running individuals.

#### Formal Framework

To understand the formal framework of formal semantics, consider the following steps:

1. **Basic Types and Functions**
   - **Entities ($e$)**: Objects in the world.
   - **Truth Values ($t$)**: True or false propositions.
   - **Functions**: Mappings from one type to another, such as $(e \rightarrow t)$ for predicates.

2. **Lambda Calculus Expressions**
   - **Variables and Abstraction**: Variables represent entities, and lambda abstraction is used to create functions.
   - **Example**: $\lambda x. \text{runs}(x)$ is a function that takes an entity \( x \) and returns true if \( x \) runs.

3. **Possible Worlds Semantics**
   - **Possible Worlds**: Different scenarios or contexts in which expressions are evaluated.
   - **Operators**: Modal operators like $\Box$ (necessarily) and $\Diamond$ (possibly) are used to handle modality.
   - **Example**: $\Box \text{runs}(\text{John})$ means "John necessarily runs."

#### Examples and Analysis

1. **Simple Sentence**
   - **Sentence**: "John runs."
   - **Syntax**: \( S \rightarrow NP \ VP \)
     - \( NP \rightarrow \text{John} \)
     - \( VP \rightarrow \text{runs} \)
   - **Semantics**: $\text{runs}(\text{John})$
     - **Type Assignment**: $\text{runs}$ is of type $e \rightarrow t$, and $\text{John}$ is of type $e$.
     - **Application**: $\text{runs}(\text{John})$ yields a truth value.

2. **Quantified Sentence**
   - **Sentence**: "Every student runs."
   - **Syntax**: \( S \rightarrow NP \ VP \)
     - \( NP \rightarrow \text{Every student} \)
     - \( VP \rightarrow \text{runs} \)
   - **Semantics**: $\forall x (\text{student}(x) \rightarrow \text{runs}(x))$
     - **Type Assignment**: $\text{Every student}$ is a quantifier of type $(e \rightarrow t) \rightarrow t$.
     - **Application**: $\forall x (\text{student}(x) \rightarrow \text{runs}(x))$ applies the predicate $\text{runs}$ to all entities satisfying $\text{student}$.

3. **Modal Sentence**
   - **Sentence**: "John must run."
   - **Syntax**: \( S \rightarrow NP \ VP \)
     - \( NP \rightarrow \text{John} \)
     - \( VP \rightarrow \text{must run} \)
   - **Semantics**: $\Box \text{runs}(\text{John})$
     - **Type Assignment**: $\Box$ is a modal operator of type $(t \rightarrow t)$.
     - **Application**: $\Box (\text{runs}(\text{John}))$ means it is necessarily true that John runs.

#### Handling Ambiguity

Formal semantics is particularly adept at handling different types of ambiguities, such as [[scope ambiguity]], through precise syntactic and semantic rules.

1. **Scope Ambiguity**
   - **Sentence**: "A teacher praised every student."
   - **Wide Scope of "a teacher"**: $\exists x (\text{teacher}(x) \land \forall y (\text{student}(y) \rightarrow \text{praised}(x, y)))$
   - **Wide Scope of "every student"**: $\forall y (\text{student}(y) \rightarrow \exists x (\text{teacher}(x) \land \text{praised}(x, y)))$

2. **Lexical Ambiguity**
   - **Sentence**: "He saw her duck."
   - **Meanings**:
     - **Bird Interpretation**: $\text{see}(\text{he}, \text{her duck})$
     - **Action Interpretation**: $\text{see}(\text{he}, \text{her} \land \text{duck})$

### Conclusion

Formal semantics provides a rigorous framework for understanding the meaning of natural language expressions. By systematically mapping syntactic structures to semantic interpretations using tools like type theory, lambda calculus, and possible worlds semantics, it allows for precise analysis of language. This approach is crucial for both theoretical linguistics and practical applications such as natural language processing, ensuring that meanings can be clearly and unambiguously represented and interpreted.
