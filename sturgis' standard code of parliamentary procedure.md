Sturgis' Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure


**ASSISTANT**

### Sturgis' Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure

**Sturgis' Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure** (Sturgis) is a widely used manual for conducting meetings and decision-making in various types of organizations. It offers a simplified, user-friendly approach to parliamentary procedure compared to more complex manuals like [[Robert's Rules of Order|Robert's Rules]].

#### Core Principles

1. **Efficiency and Flexibility**: Sturgis emphasizes streamlined procedures that promote efficient and flexible meeting management.
2. **Fairness and Order**: Ensures that all members have a voice while maintaining order during discussions and decision-making.
3. **Majority Rule with Minority Rights**: Decisions are made by majority vote, but the rights of the minority are protected.

#### Key Concepts

1. **Motions**: Formal proposals presented for discussion and decision. Sturgis categorizes motions into:
   - **Main Motions**: Introduce new business or propose decisions.
   - **Secondary Motions**: Support or alter main motions. These include:
     - **Subsidiary Motions**: Modify or dispose of the main motion (e.g., amend, postpone).
     - **Privileged Motions**: Address urgent matters unrelated to the current business (e.g., adjourn, recess).
     - **Incidental Motions**: Raise procedural questions (e.g., point of order, division of the assembly).

2. **Debate**: Controlled discussion of motions, ensuring orderly and fair participation:
   - **Recognition**: Members must be recognized by the chair before speaking.
   - **Limits on Debate**: Time limits and the number of speeches may be set to ensure efficiency.

3. **Voting**: Methods to accurately reflect members' decisions:
   - **Voice Vote**: Members express their vote aloud.
   - **Roll Call Vote**: Votes are recorded individually.
   - **Secret Ballot**: Votes are cast anonymously.

4. **Quorum**: The minimum number of members required to be present to conduct business, typically defined in the organizationâ€™s bylaws.

#### Meeting Structure

1. **Call to Order**: The meeting begins with a formal call to order by the presiding officer.
2. **Approval of Minutes**: Review and approval of the minutes from the previous meeting.
3. **Reports**: Presentation of reports from officers, boards, and standing committees.
4. **Unfinished Business**: Addressing any business carried over from previous meetings.
5. **New Business**: Introduction and discussion of new topics.
6. **Adjournment**: Formal conclusion of the meeting.

#### Differences from Robert's Rules

1. **Simplicity**: Sturgis is generally simpler and less detailed, making it easier for smaller organizations and less formal settings to implement.
2. **Fewer Types of Motions**: Sturgis uses a more streamlined classification of motions, reducing complexity.
3. **Flexibility**: Sturgis allows more flexibility in procedures, accommodating the specific needs of different organizations.

#### Practical Application

Sturgis' Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure is used by a wide range of organizations, including:

- Professional associations
- Nonprofit organizations
- Homeowner associations
- Small governing bodies

The use of Sturgis helps ensure that meetings are conducted efficiently and fairly, allowing all members to participate fully and equitably.
