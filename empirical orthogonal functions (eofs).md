## Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs)

Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs), also known as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in the context of meteorology and oceanography, are a statistical method used to analyze spatial and temporal patterns in data. EOF analysis decomposes a multivariate dataset into orthogonal basis functions, which capture the most significant modes of variability in the data.

### Definition

EOF analysis aims to transform the original data, which may be correlated, into a set of uncorrelated variables called principal components. These components are linear combinations of the original variables and are ordered by the amount of variance they explain.

### Mathematical Formalism

#### Data Matrix

Consider a dataset represented by a matrix \( \mathbf{X} \) of size \( M \times N \), where \( M \) is the number of spatial points and \( N \) is the number of time points. The elements \( X_{ij} \) of the matrix represent the value of a variable at the \( i \)-th spatial point and \( j \)-th time point.

#### Covariance Matrix

The covariance matrix \( \mathbf{C} \) of the dataset \( \mathbf{X} \) is given by:

$$
\mathbf{C} = \frac{1}{N} \mathbf{X} \mathbf{X}^\top
$$

where \( \mathbf{X}^\top \) denotes the transpose of \( \mathbf{X} \).

#### Eigenvalue Decomposition

EOF analysis involves performing an eigenvalue decomposition of the covariance matrix \( \mathbf{C} \):

$$
\mathbf{C} \mathbf{E} = \mathbf{E} \mathbf{\Lambda}
$$

where:

- \( \mathbf{E} \) is a matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors (EOFs) of \( \mathbf{C} \).
- \( \mathbf{\Lambda} \) is a diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues \( \lambda_i \), which represent the variance explained by each EOF.

### Principal Components

The principal components (PCs) are the projections of the original data onto the EOFs:

$$
\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{E}^\top \mathbf{X}
$$

where \( \mathbf{A} \) is a matrix of size \( M \times N \) containing the principal components.

### Interpretation

- **EOFs**: Represent spatial patterns in the data. Each EOF is a mode of variability, showing how different regions co-vary.
- **Eigenvalues**: Indicate the amount of variance explained by each EOF. The largest eigenvalue corresponds to the EOF that explains the most variance.
- **Principal Components**: Represent the time series of the coefficients for each EOF. These indicate how the strength of the spatial patterns (EOFs) varies over time.

### Applications

EOF analysis is widely used in various fields such as:

- **Meteorology and Oceanography**: To identify dominant modes of climate variability, such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO).
- **Geophysics**: To analyze patterns in seismic data or gravitational fields.
- **Environmental Science**: To study pollution patterns and their temporal evolution.
- **Finance**: To reduce the dimensionality of financial datasets and identify underlying factors affecting asset prices.

### Example

Consider a simplified example with temperature data at 3 spatial locations over 4 time points. The data matrix \( \mathbf{X} \) might look like:

$$
\mathbf{X} = \begin{pmatrix}
15 & 16 & 14 & 15 \\
12 & 13 & 12 & 14 \\
10 & 11 & 10 & 11
\end{pmatrix}
$$

The covariance matrix \( \mathbf{C} \) is computed as:

$$
\mathbf{C} = \frac{1}{4} \mathbf{X} \mathbf{X}^\top
$$

Performing eigenvalue decomposition on \( \mathbf{C} \), we obtain the EOFs (eigenvectors) and eigenvalues.

The principal components are then calculated by projecting the original data onto these EOFs, providing a compact representation of the dominant modes of variability in the data.

EOF analysis thus provides a powerful technique for identifying and interpreting the primary modes of variability in multivariate datasets, making it a crucial tool in many scientific and engineering applications.
