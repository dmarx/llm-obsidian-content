# Measures of Central Tendency

A [[measure of central tendency]] provides a single value that attempts to describe the center of a [[probability distribution]] or [[dataset]]. The three most commonly used measures are the [[arithmetic mean]], [[median]], and [[mode]], each capturing different aspects of centrality through distinct mathematical properties.

## Mathematical Formalization

Let X = {x₁, ..., xₙ} be a dataset of n observations.

### Arithmetic Mean
The [[arithmetic mean]] (μ) is defined as:
μ = (1/n) ∑ᵢ xᵢ

Key properties:
- Minimizes the sum of squared deviations: μ = argmin_θ ∑ᵢ (xᵢ - θ)²
- [[sufficient statistic]] for the location parameter of a [[normal distribution]]
- Sensitive to [[outliers]]

### Median
The [[median]] (m) is defined as:
m = x₍ₙ₊₁₎/₂ for odd n
m = (x₍ₙ/₂₎ + x₍ₙ/₂₊₁₎)/2 for even n

where x₍ᵢ₎ denotes the i-th order statistic

Key properties:
- Minimizes the sum of absolute deviations: m = argmin_θ ∑ᵢ |xᵢ - θ|
- [[robust statistic]] resistant to outliers
- [[sufficient statistic]] for the location parameter of a [[Laplace distribution]]

### Mode
The [[mode]] (M) is defined as:
M = argmax_x f(x)

where f(x) is the [[probability density function]] for continuous distributions or [[probability mass function]] for discrete distributions.

## Generalized Mean

The [[power mean]] (or [[generalized mean]]) provides a unified framework:
M_p = (1/n ∑ᵢ xᵢᵖ)^(1/p)

Special cases:
- p = 1: arithmetic mean
- p = -1: [[harmonic mean]]
- p = 2: [[quadratic mean]] (RMS)
- p → 0: [[geometric mean]]
- p → ∞: maximum
- p → -∞: minimum

## Relationship to Maximum Likelihood

Each measure of central tendency can be derived as the [[maximum likelihood estimator]] for the location parameter under different assumed error distributions:
- Arithmetic mean: [[normal distribution]]
- Median: [[Laplace distribution]]
- Mode: [[uniform distribution]]

This relationship provides a theoretical foundation for choosing appropriate measures based on the underlying data generating process.
