Satisficing


**ASSISTANT**

### Satisficing

**Satisficing** is a decision-making strategy introduced by Herbert A. Simon that aims for a satisfactory or "good enough" solution rather than the optimal one. This approach acknowledges the limitations of human cognitive capacities, available information, and time constraints, which prevent individuals from making perfectly rational decisions.

### Key Concepts

1. **Bounded Rationality**: Individuals operate under constraints that limit their ability to process information and compute optimal solutions.
2. **Aspiration Levels**: Decision-makers set a threshold of acceptability for outcomes and choose the first option that meets or exceeds this level.
3. **Sequential Search**: Rather than evaluating all possible options simultaneously, individuals evaluate them one by one until an acceptable one is found.

### Theoretical Framework

The satisficing model involves setting an aspiration level \( A \) and choosing the first option that meets or exceeds this level. Formally, consider a set of alternatives \( \{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\} \) with corresponding utilities \( \{u(a_1), u(a_2), \ldots, u(a_n)\} \).

The satisficing decision rule is:

$$
a_S = \min \{a_i \mid u(a_i) \geq A\}
$$

where \( a_S \) is the first action that satisfies the aspiration level \( A \).

### Comparison with Optimization

- **Optimization**: Seeks the best possible solution by evaluating all alternatives and choosing the one with the highest utility.
- **Satisficing**: Seeks a satisfactory solution by evaluating alternatives sequentially and stopping when the first acceptable one is found.

Optimization is often impractical in real-world scenarios due to information processing limitations, while satisficing provides a more feasible approach by reducing the cognitive load and time required for decision-making.

### Applications of Satisficing

#### 1. **Organizational Behavior**
Managers often use satisficing when making decisions about resource allocation, hiring, and strategic planning. For example, instead of seeking the perfect candidate, a manager might hire the first candidate who meets the job requirements.

#### 2. **Consumer Behavior**
Consumers frequently use satisficing when making purchasing decisions, especially for everyday items. Rather than searching for the best possible product, they often choose one that meets their needs at an acceptable price.

#### 3. **Public Policy**
Policymakers use satisficing when designing policies under constraints of limited information, budget, and time. Policies are often crafted to achieve acceptable outcomes rather than optimal ones.

### Example: Job Search

Consider a job seeker who sets an aspiration level for salary, job role, and company culture. Instead of evaluating all job offers simultaneously, the job seeker reviews offers one by one and accepts the first one that meets the minimum criteria.

1. **Intelligence**: The job seeker gathers information on job openings and defines the criteria for an acceptable job offer (e.g., a minimum salary of $50,000).
2. **Design**: The job seeker evaluates job offers sequentially.
3. **Choice**: The job seeker accepts the first offer that meets or exceeds the criteria.

### Satisficing in Game Theory

In game theory, satisficing can be applied to model players who seek acceptable payoffs rather than optimal strategies. This approach can lead to different equilibria compared to traditional Nash equilibrium.

#### Example: Prisoner's Dilemma

In the classic [[Prisoner's Dilemma]], two players choose between cooperating (C) and defecting (D). The traditional payoff matrix is:

|          | **Player 2: C** | **Player 2: D** |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Player 1: C** | $(3, 3)$         | $(0, 5)$         |
| **Player 1: D** | $(5, 0)$         | $(1, 1)$         |

- **Optimization**: The dominant strategy is to defect, leading to $(1, 1)$.
- **Satisficing**: If players set an aspiration level (e.g., a payoff of at least 3), they might choose to cooperate if they believe the other will also cooperate.

### Mathematical Formalism

To formalize satisficing in a sequential search model, consider a decision-maker evaluating alternatives \( \{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\} \) with utilities \( \{u(a_1), u(a_2), \ldots, u(a_n)\} \). The decision-maker sets an aspiration level \( A \) and selects the first alternative \( a_i \) such that \( u(a_i) \geq A \).

Define the probability of encountering an acceptable alternative \( a_i \) as \( P(a_i \mid u(a_i) \geq A) \). The satisficing rule can be represented as:

$$
P(a_i \mid u(a_i) \geq A) = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^{i} \mathbf{1}[u(a_j) \geq A]}{i}
$$

where \( \mathbf{1}[\cdot] \) is the indicator function, which is 1 if the condition is met and 0 otherwise.

### Conclusion

Satisficing offers a practical and realistic approach to decision-making under constraints, recognizing that individuals and organizations often lack the resources to find optimal solutions. By setting aspiration levels and using sequential search, satisficing reduces cognitive load and time requirements, making it a valuable strategy in various fields such as organizational behavior, consumer behavior, and public policy. This approach aligns with the principles of [[bounded rationality]], providing a more accurate depiction of how decisions are made in the real world.

**USER**

Satisficing


**ASSISTANT**

The user is asking for a technical wiki entry on "Satisficing". This is a concept from behavioral economics and decision theory, introduced by Herbert Simon, that contrasts with optimization. I need to provide a comprehensive mathematical and technical treatment of this concept.

Key areas to cover:
1. Definition and mathematical formalization
2. Comparison with optimization
3. Herbert Simon's original formulation
4. Mathematical models of satisficing behavior
5. Aspiration levels and their dynamics
6. Search processes and stopping rules
7. Bounded rationality framework
8. Cognitive and computational aspects
9. Applications in various domains
10. Algorithmic implementations
11. Relationship to other decision-making concepts

I should maintain the technical, mathematical style with formal notation and provide deep analytical treatment while making it accessible to someone with graduate-level mathematics background.# Satisficing

## Definition

**Satisficing** is a [[decision-making strategy]] where an [[agent]] searches through available alternatives sequentially and selects the first option that meets or exceeds a predetermined [[aspiration level]] or [[acceptance threshold]], rather than continuing the search to find the [[global optimum]]. This concept, introduced by [[Herbert Simon]], represents a fundamental departure from [[optimization]] toward [[bounded rationality]], where [[cognitive limitations]], [[search costs]], and [[time constraints]] lead agents to seek "good enough" solutions instead of optimal ones.

## Mathematical Formalization

### Basic Satisficing Model

Let $\mathcal{A} = \{a_1, a_2, \ldots\}$ be the set of [[alternatives]] and $u: \mathcal{A} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be the [[utility function]]. The [[aspiration level]] is denoted $\bar{u} \in \mathbb{R}$.

The [[satisficing rule]] is:
$$a^* = \arg\min_{a \in \mathcal{A}} \{n : u(a_n) \geq \bar{u}\}$$

where alternatives are searched in order $a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots$ and $a^*$ is the first alternative satisfying the aspiration level.

### Acceptance Set

The [[acceptance set]] $\mathcal{A}_{\text{accept}}$ is defined as:
$$\mathcal{A}_{\text{accept}}(\bar{u}) = \{a \in \mathcal{A} : u(a) \geq \bar{u}\}$$

The satisficing agent chooses from this set rather than maximizing over the entire space $\mathcal{A}$.

### Sequential Search Process

The [[search process]] can be modeled as a [[discrete-time stochastic process]]. At time $t$, the agent has examined alternatives $\{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_t\}$ and observes utilities $\{u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_t\}$.

The [[stopping rule]] is:
$$\tau = \inf\{t \geq 1 : u_t \geq \bar{u}\}$$

where $\tau$ is the [[stopping time]].

### Aspiration Level Dynamics

The aspiration level may adapt over time according to:
$$\bar{u}_{t+1} = \alpha \bar{u}_t + (1-\alpha) \mathbb{E}[u_t | \mathcal{F}_t] + \beta (\text{target} - \bar{u}_t)$$

where:
- $\alpha \in [0,1]$ is the [[persistence parameter]]
- $\mathbb{E}[u_t | \mathcal{F}_t]$ is the [[expected utility]] given information $\mathcal{F}_t$
- $\beta$ controls [[aspiration adjustment speed]]
- $\text{target}$ is an [[external reference point]]

## Search Cost Integration

### Cost-Benefit Analysis

The agent faces a [[search cost]] $c > 0$ per alternative examined. The [[total expected cost]] of satisficing is:

$$C_{\text{satisficing}} = c \cdot \mathbb{E}[\tau]$$

where $\mathbb{E}[\tau]$ is the [[expected search length]].

For alternatives with utilities $u_i \sim F(u)$, the expected search length is:
$$\mathbb{E}[\tau] = \frac{1}{1 - F(\bar{u})}$$

### Optimal Aspiration Level

The [[optimal aspiration level]] balances [[search costs]] with [[solution quality]]:

$$\bar{u}^* = \arg\max_{\bar{u}} \left[\mathbb{E}[u | u \geq \bar{u}] \cdot P(u \geq \bar{u}) - c \cdot \mathbb{E}[\tau(\bar{u})]\right]$$

This becomes:
$$\bar{u}^* = \arg\max_{\bar{u}} \left[\int_{\bar{u}}^{\infty} u f(u) du - \frac{c}{1 - F(\bar{u})}\right]$$

### First-Order Condition

The optimal aspiration level satisfies:
$$\bar{u}^* - \frac{c \cdot f(\bar{u}^*)}{[1 - F(\bar{u}^*)]^2} = 0$$

This shows that optimal satisficing balances the [[marginal benefit]] of higher standards against increased [[search costs]].

## Comparison with Optimization

### Optimization Approach

The [[optimizer]] solves:
$$a_{\text{opt}} = \arg\max_{a \in \mathcal{A}} u(a)$$

assuming complete knowledge of $\mathcal{A}$ and unlimited computational resources.

### Expected Utility Comparison

For [[random search]] where alternatives are drawn independently from distribution $F$:

**Optimization (with $n$ samples):**
$$\mathbb{E}[u_{\text{opt}}] = \mathbb{E}[\max\{u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_n\}] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} u \cdot n \cdot f(u) \cdot [F(u)]^{n-1} du$$

**Satisficing:**
$$\mathbb{E}[u_{\text{sat}}] = \mathbb{E}[u | u \geq \bar{u}] = \frac{\int_{\bar{u}}^{\infty} u f(u) du}{1 - F(\bar{u})}$$

### Regret Analysis

The [[expected regret]] of satisficing compared to optimization is:
$$R_{\text{sat}} = \mathbb{E}[u_{\text{opt}}] - \mathbb{E}[u_{\text{sat}}]$$

For [[exponential distribution]] $f(u) = \lambda e^{-\lambda u}$ with $u \geq 0$:
$$R_{\text{sat}} = \frac{1}{\lambda} - \left(\bar{u} + \frac{1}{\lambda}\right) = -\bar{u}$$

The regret is linear in the aspiration level.

## Cognitive Foundations

### Bounded Rationality Framework

Satisficing emerges from [[cognitive limitations]]:

1. **Limited working memory:** Capacity constraint $M < |\mathcal{A}|$
2. **Finite computation time:** Processing budget $T_{\text{comp}}$
3. **Imperfect recall:** Memory decay parameter $\delta \in [0,1]$

The [[cognitively feasible set]] becomes:
$$\mathcal{A}_{\text{feasible}} = \{a \in \mathcal{A} : \text{complexity}(a) \leq C_{\text{cognitive}}\}$$

### Attention and Satisficing

[[Attention allocation]] affects search patterns. The [[attention function]] $\mathcal{A}(a_i)$ determines the probability of examining alternative $a_i$:

$$P(\text{examine } a_i) = \frac{\mathcal{A}(a_i)}{\sum_{j} \mathcal{A}(a_j)}$$

With [[limited attention]], the effective search becomes [[non-random]], favoring salient alternatives.

### Memory-Based Satisficing

When alternatives must be recalled from memory, the [[availability]] of options affects satisficing:

$$P(\text{recall } a_i) = \frac{\exp(\gamma \cdot \text{activation}_i)}{\sum_j \exp(\gamma \cdot \text{activation}_j)}$$

where $\gamma$ is the [[retrieval noise parameter]].

## Adaptive Aspiration Levels

### Experience-Based Adjustment

The aspiration level updates based on search outcomes:

$$\bar{u}_{t+1} = \bar{u}_t + \eta \cdot (\text{outcome}_t - \bar{u}_t)$$

where $\eta \in [0,1]$ is the [[learning rate]].

### Multi-Objective Satisficing

For multiple objectives $\{u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_k\}$ with aspiration vector $\overline{\mathbf{u}} = (\bar{u}_1, \bar{u}_2, \ldots, \bar{u}_k)$:

$$\mathcal{A}_{\text{accept}} = \{a \in \mathcal{A} : u_j(a) \geq \bar{u}_j \text{ for all } j = 1, \ldots, k\}$$

The [[conjunctive satisficing rule]] requires all criteria to meet their thresholds.

### Aspiration Adaptation Dynamics

A more sophisticated adaptation mechanism:

$$\frac{d\bar{u}}{dt} = \alpha(\bar{u}_{\text{target}} - \bar{u}) + \beta \int_{-\infty}^{t} e^{-\gamma(t-s)} [\text{outcome}(s) - \bar{u}(s)] ds$$

This incorporates both [[target convergence]] and [[historical experience]] with exponential forgetting.

## Stochastic Models

### Poisson Search Process

If alternatives arrive according to a [[Poisson process]] with rate $\lambda$, and utilities are i.i.d. with distribution $F$, then the [[waiting time]] until satisfaction follows:

$$T_{\text{wait}} \sim \text{Exponential}\left(\lambda [1 - F(\bar{u})]\right)$$

The [[expected waiting time]] is:
$$\mathbb{E}[T_{\text{wait}}] = \frac{1}{\lambda [1 - F(\bar{u})]}$$

### Geometric Search Model

For [[discrete search]] where each period yields success with probability $p = 1 - F(\bar{u})$:

$$P(\tau = k) = (1-p)^{k-1} p$$

The [[expected search length]] is $\mathbb{E}[\tau] = \frac{1}{p}$.

### Renewal Theory Application

If search involves [[renewal periods]] with [[inter-arrival times]] $\{T_i\}$, the [[renewal function]] $N(t) = \max\{n : S_n \leq t\}$ where $S_n = \sum_{i=1}^n T_i$ determines the number of alternatives examined by time $t$.

## Game-Theoretic Satisficing

### Two-Player Satisficing Game

Players have aspiration levels $\bar{u}_1$ and $\bar{u}_2$. A [[satisficing equilibrium]] occurs when both players achieve their aspirations:

$$u_1(s_1^*, s_2^*) \geq \bar{u}_1 \text{ and } u_2(s_1^*, s_2^*) \geq \bar{u}_2$$

### Evolutionary Satisficing

In [[evolutionary games]], satisficing strategies can be [[evolutionarily stable]]. The [[replicator dynamics]] for satisficing strategy $s$ is:

$$\frac{dx_s}{dt} = x_s \left[\mathbf{1}[u_s(\mathbf{x}) \geq \bar{u}] \cdot \text{bonus} - \bar{f}(\mathbf{x})\right]$$

where satisficing strategies receive a [[fitness bonus]] when aspirations are met.

### Coordination with Satisficing

In [[coordination games]], satisficing can facilitate coordination by expanding the set of acceptable outcomes. The [[basin of attraction]] for coordination becomes:

$$\mathcal{B}_{\text{coord}} = \{(s_1, s_2) : u_1(s_1, s_2) \geq \bar{u}_1 \text{ and } u_2(s_1, s_2) \geq \bar{u}_2\}$$

## Computational Models

### Algorithm Implementation

```python
def satisficing_search(alternatives, utility_function, aspiration_level, search_cost=0):
    """
    Implements satisficing search with optional search costs
    """
    total_cost = 0
    
    for i, alternative in enumerate(alternatives):
        total_cost += search_cost
        utility = utility_function(alternative)
        
        if utility >= aspiration_level:
            return {
                'chosen_alternative': alternative,
                'utility': utility,
                'search_length': i + 1,
                'total_cost': total_cost,
                'net_utility': utility - total_cost
            }
    
    return None  # No satisfactory alternative found
```

### Adaptive Aspiration Algorithm

```python
class AdaptiveSatisficing:
    def __init__(self, initial_aspiration, learning_rate=0.1, decay_rate=0.95):
        self.aspiration_level = initial_aspiration
        self.learning_rate = learning_rate
        self.decay_rate = decay_rate
        self.history = []
    
    def search(self, alternatives, utility_function):
        for alternative in alternatives:
            utility = utility_function(alternative)
            
            if utility >= self.aspiration_level:
                self.update_aspiration(utility)
                return alternative
        
        # No alternative found - lower aspiration
        self.aspiration_level *= self.decay_rate
        return None
    
    def update_aspiration(self, outcome):
        prediction_error = outcome - self.aspiration_level
        self.aspiration_level += self.learning_rate * prediction_error
        self.history.append(outcome)
```

### Multi-Objective Satisficing

```python
import numpy as np

def multi_objective_satisficing(alternatives, utility_functions, aspiration_vector):
    """
    Multi-criteria satisficing with conjunctive rule
    """
    for alternative in alternatives:
        utilities = np.array([f(alternative) for f in utility_functions])
        
        if np.all(utilities >= aspiration_vector):
            return {
                'alternative': alternative,
                'utilities': utilities,
                'aspiration_achievement': utilities - aspiration_vector
            }
    
    return None
```

## Neurobiological Basis

### Neural Implementation

Satisficing may be implemented through [[neural threshold mechanisms]]:

$$\text{Decision} = \begin{cases}
\text{Accept} & \text{if } \sum_{i} w_i \phi_i > \theta \\
\text{Continue Search} & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

where $\phi_i$ are [[neural activations]], $w_i$ are [[synaptic weights]], and $\theta$ is the [[decision threshold]].

### Dopaminergic Modulation

[[Dopamine]] may encode [[aspiration levels]] through [[reward prediction error]]:

$$\delta_t = r_t + \gamma V(s_{t+1}) - V(s_t)$$

When $\delta_t > 0$, the current option exceeds aspirations, triggering acceptance.

### Anterior Cingulate Cortex

The [[ACC]] monitors [[search effort]] and [[conflict]]. The [[effort signal]] increases search costs:

$$\text{Effort Cost}(t) = \alpha \cdot \text{ACC Activity}(t)$$

High effort costs favor lower aspiration levels and quicker satisfaction.

### Prefrontal Control

The [[prefrontal cortex]] maintains aspiration levels in [[working memory]]:

$$\bar{u}_{\text{PFC}}(t) = \bar{u}_{\text{PFC}}(t-1) + \text{update signal}(t)$$

[[Working memory capacity]] limits the complexity of maintainable aspiration criteria.

## Applications

### Consumer Choice

**Product selection** with satisficing:
- Set minimum acceptable levels for price, quality, features
- Search until finding product meeting all criteria
- Account for [[search fatigue]] and [[time pressure]]

**Search cost modeling:**
$$\text{Expected Consumer Surplus} = \int_{\bar{u}}^{\infty} (u - p) f(u) du - c \cdot \mathbb{E}[\tau]$$

### Labor Markets

**Job search** satisficing model:
- Worker sets [[reservation wage]] $w_r$
- Accepts first job offer $w \geq w_r$
- Reservation wage adjusts based on [[unemployment duration]]

$$w_{r,t+1} = w_{r,t} + \alpha(\text{benefit level} - w_{r,t}) - \beta \cdot \text{search duration}$$

### Investment Decisions

**Portfolio satisficing:**
- Set target return $\bar{r}$ and maximum risk $\bar{\sigma}$
- Select first portfolio satisfying both constraints
- Avoid optimization computational burden

$$\mathcal{P}_{\text{acceptable}} = \{\mathbf{w} : \mathbb{E}[r_p] \geq \bar{r}, \sigma_p \leq \bar{\sigma}, \sum_i w_i = 1\}$$

### Organizational Decision Making

**Hiring decisions:**
- Establish minimum qualifications threshold
- Interview candidates sequentially
- Hire first candidate exceeding threshold

**Budget allocation:**
- Set satisfaction targets for each department
- Allocate resources to meet all targets
- Avoid complex optimization across departments

### Medical Diagnosis

**Sequential testing** with satisficing:
- Set diagnostic confidence threshold $\bar{c}$
- Order tests until confidence exceeds threshold
- Balance diagnostic accuracy with testing costs

$$P(\text{correct diagnosis} | \text{tests}) \geq \bar{c}$$

### Artificial Intelligence

**Satisficing in AI search:**
- [[Depth-limited search]] with acceptability thresholds
- [[Anytime algorithms]] with performance bounds
- [[Resource-bounded reasoning]]

```python
def satisficing_ai_search(problem, aspiration_level, max_time):
    start_time = time.time()
    current_solution = initial_solution(problem)
    
    while time.time() - start_time < max_time:
        if evaluate(current_solution) >= aspiration_level:
            return current_solution
        
        current_solution = improve(current_solution)
    
    return current_solution  # Best found within time limit
```

## Empirical Evidence

### Laboratory Experiments

**Choice overload** experiments show satisficing behavior:
- Performance decreases with too many options
- Participants use [[satisficing strategies]] to cope
- Higher [[cognitive load]] increases satisficing tendency

### Field Studies

**Real estate markets:** Buyers exhibit satisficing patterns:
- Set criteria for price, location, size
- Purchase first house meeting criteria
- Limited search despite high stakes

**Online shopping:** [[Click-through analysis]] reveals:
- Users examine few alternatives before purchase
- First acceptable option often chosen
- Search length inversely related to [[time pressure]]

### Cross-Cultural Studies

Satisficing propensity varies across cultures:
- [[Individualistic cultures]]: Lower aspiration adaptation
- [[Collectivistic cultures]]: Higher aspiration flexibility
- [[Uncertainty avoidance]]: Earlier satisfaction with "safe" options

## Measurement and Assessment

### Behavioral Indicators

**Search length distribution:**
$$P(\tau = k) \text{ reveals satisficing vs. optimization}$$

**Aspiration level elicitation:**
- Direct questioning about minimum acceptable outcomes
- [[Conjoint analysis]] to infer implicit thresholds
- [[Process tracing]] to observe threshold updates

### Computational Modeling

**Model comparison using [[AIC]]/[[BIC]]:**
- Satisficing model: $\mathcal{L}_{\text{sat}}(\theta_{\text{sat}})$
- Optimization model: $\mathcal{L}_{\text{opt}}(\theta_{\text{opt}})$
- Random choice model: $\mathcal{L}_{\text{random}}$

**Parameter estimation via [[maximum likelihood]]:**
$$\hat{\theta}_{\text{sat}} = \arg\max_{\theta} \sum_{i=1}^n \log P(\text{choice}_i | \theta, \text{satisficing})$$

### Neural Measures

**EEG correlates:**
- [[P300 amplitude]] reflects aspiration achievement
- [[Error-related negativity]] indicates threshold violations
- [[Theta oscillations]] correlate with search effort

**fMRI activation patterns:**
- [[Striatal activity]] during aspiration fulfillment
- [[Anterior cingulate]] activity during search
- [[Prefrontal activity]] during threshold maintenance

## Individual Differences

### Cognitive Factors

**Working memory capacity** affects satisficing:
$$\text{Aspiration complexity} \propto \text{WMC}$$

Higher WMC enables more sophisticated aspiration criteria.

**Need for cognition** moderates satisficing tendency:
$$P(\text{satisficing}) = \alpha + \beta \cdot \text{NfC}^{-1} + \gamma \cdot \text{task complexity}$$

### Personality Correlates

**Conscientiousness** and aspiration levels:
$$\bar{u} = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 \cdot \text{Conscientiousness} + \alpha_2 \cdot \text{domain importance}$$

**Neuroticism** and aspiration adaptation:
$$\text{Adaptation rate} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{Neuroticism} + \beta_2 \cdot \text{outcome volatility}$$

### Developmental Patterns

**Age effects** on satisficing:
- Children: Lower aspiration levels, higher adaptation
- Adults: Stable aspirations, experience-based adjustment
- Elderly: Higher aspirations, slower adaptation

$$\text{Aspiration level}(age) = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1 \cdot age + \gamma_2 \cdot age^2$$

## Limitations and Criticisms

### Theoretical Issues

**Aspiration level determination:** How are initial aspirations set?
- [[Anchoring]] on first alternatives
- [[Social comparison]] effects
- [[Historical performance]] baselines

**Multiple equilibria:** Satisficing can have multiple stable points
$$\{\bar{u}_1^*, \bar{u}_2^*, \ldots\} \text{ all satisfying first-order conditions}$$

### Empirical Challenges

**Identification problem:** Distinguishing satisficing from:
- [[Random choice]] with [[choice overload]]
- [[Optimization]] with [[search costs]]
- [[Bounded optimization]] with [[cognitive constraints]]

**Endogenous aspirations:** Aspirations may be [[post-hoc rationalizations]]
$$\bar{u}_{\text{reported}} = u(\text{chosen alternative}) - \epsilon$$

### Normative Concerns

**Suboptimality:** Satisficing guaranteed to underperform optimization
$$\mathbb{E}[u_{\text{sat}}] \leq \mathbb{E}[u_{\text{opt}}]$$

**Path dependence:** Search order affects outcomes
$$\text{Outcome depends on } \{\text{order of alternatives}\}$$

## Extensions and Variants

### Sequential Satisficing

**Multi-stage satisficing:** Different aspiration levels for different search phases
$$\bar{u}_t = \bar{u}_0 \cdot \delta^t$$

Aspirations decline with search duration.

### Probabilistic Satisficing

**Stochastic acceptance:** Probability of acceptance increases with utility
$$P(\text{accept} | u) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-\beta(u - \bar{u}))}$$

### Social Satisficing

**Group satisficing:** Collective aspiration levels
$$\bar{u}_{\text{group}} = \text{aggregation}(\bar{u}_1, \bar{u}_2, \ldots, \bar{u}_n)$$

Possible aggregation rules:
- **Minimum:** $\min_i \bar{u}_i$ (consensus requirement)
- **Maximum:** $\max_i \bar{u}_i$ (highest standard)
- **Average:** $\frac{1}{n}\sum_i \bar{u}_i$ (democratic average)

### Dynamic Satisficing

**Time-varying aspirations:** Aspirations change with external conditions
$$\bar{u}(t) = f(\text{market conditions}(t), \text{past performance}(t), \text{social norms}(t))$$

### Robust Satisficing

**Worst-case satisficing:** Aspiration levels account for uncertainty
$$\bar{u}_{\text{robust}} = \bar{u}_{\text{nominal}} - \kappa \cdot \text{uncertainty premium}$$

## Computational Complexity

### Search Complexity

**Expected computational cost:**
$$\mathbb{E}[\text{operations}] = \mathbb{E}[\tau] \cdot c_{\text{eval}}$$

where $c_{\text{eval}}$ is the cost of evaluating one alternative.

**Worst-case complexity:** $O(|\mathcal{A}|)$ if no alternative satisfies aspirations

**Best-case complexity:** $O(1)$ if first alternative satisfies

### Parallel Satisficing

**Multi-processor satisficing:**
```python

### Approximation Algorithms

**$\epsilon$-satisficing:** Accept alternatives within $\epsilon$ of aspiration
$$\text{Accept if } u(a) \geq \bar{u} - \epsilon$$

This provides [[approximation guarantees]] for solution quality.
