**USER**

produce relevant statistics that characterize the extent, growth, and directionality of the ongoing mental health crises in the US, including increases in general poor mental health in the population, lack of accessibility to mental health resources broadly, lack of access to those who need it most specifically, non-coverage of mental health by insurers, lack of providers required to meet demand for services, and overburdening available providers resulting in rapid career churn and worsening the provider crisis


**ASSISTANT**

To address your request for a comprehensive statistical overview of the ongoing mental health crisis in the United States, we'll explore various dimensions including the prevalence and growth of mental health issues, access to mental health resources, insurance coverage limitations, provider shortages, and the resulting strain on mental health professionals. Here are key statistics and findings from credible sources:

### Prevalence and Growth of Mental Health Issues

1. **Overall Mental Health**: According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), 1 in 5 adults in the U.S. experience mental illness each year, and 1 in 20 adults experience a serious mental illness each year.

2. **Youth Mental Health**: The CDC reports that the prevalence of depression among youth (ages 12-17) increased from 8.5% in 2006 to 13.2% in 2019. Additionally, suicide rates among adolescents and young adults aged 10-24 increased by nearly 60% from 2007 to 2018.

3. **COVID-19 Impact**: The pandemic has exacerbated mental health conditions, with about 4 in 10 adults in the U.S. reporting symptoms of anxiety or depressive disorder during the pandemic, up from 1 in 10 adults who reported these symptoms from January to June 2019 (KFF Health Tracking Poll).

### Access to Mental Health Resources

1. **General Access**: A 2021 report by Mental Health America found that over 50% of adults with a mental illness do not receive treatment, totaling over 27 million adults in the U.S. who are going untreated.

2. **Specific Needs Access**: The same report highlights that the percentage of youth with severe depression who received consistent outpatient treatment ranges from 27% in South Dakota to 72% in the District of Columbia, indicating significant disparities.

### Insurance Coverage Issues

1. **Non-Coverage by Insurers**: Despite the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act, many individuals find that mental health services are less likely to be covered by insurance. According to NAMI, individuals with private insurance are denied coverage for mental health and addiction care at a rate double that of denial for general medical care.

### Provider Shortages

1. **Supply vs. Demand**: The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) estimates that by 2025, there will be a shortage of psychiatrists, ranging from 14,280 to 31,109. Similarly, shortages are projected for psychologists, social workers, and counselors.

2. **Geographical Disparities**: HRSA data shows that 77% of U.S. counties report severe shortages of mental healthcare workers, with rural areas being particularly underserved.

### Provider Strain and Career Churn

1. **Overburdening of Providers**: Mental health professionals report high levels of burnout, attributed to overwhelming caseloads, administrative burdens, and inadequate compensation. A survey by the American Psychological Association (APA) indicated that nearly half of psychologists who treat anxiety disorders said there arenâ€™t enough providers to meet patient demand in their communities.

2. **Career Churn**: High turnover rates among mental health professionals exacerbate shortages. Factors contributing to career churn include burnout, stress, and dissatisfaction with the health care system, which often fails to provide adequate support and compensation for mental health services.

### Conclusion

These statistics paint a clear picture of a growing mental health crisis in the U.S., characterized by increasing prevalence of mental health disorders, substantial gaps in access to needed care, systemic issues in insurance coverage, significant shortages of mental health providers, and high levels of professional burnout and turnover. Addressing these challenges requires a multifaceted approach involving policy reform, increased funding for mental health services, expanded insurance coverage, and efforts to boost the mental health workforce and support current providers.
