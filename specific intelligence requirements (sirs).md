Specific Intelligence Requirements (SIRs)


**ASSISTANT**

**Specific Intelligence Requirements (SIRs)** are detailed, actionable components of broader intelligence needs, such as Priority Intelligence Requirements (PIRs) and Friendly Force Information Requirements (FFIRs). SIRs define the precise information needed to support military decision-making and operations. They specify what information is required, where and when it should be collected, and by whom, guiding the allocation and tasking of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) assets.

## Purpose of Specific Intelligence Requirements (SIRs)

1. **Translate Broad Requirements into Actionable Tasks**: SIRs break down general intelligence needs into specific, actionable tasks that can be assigned to ISR assets. This ensures that collection efforts are focused and effective.

2. **Guide ISR Operations**: By providing clear and precise directives, SIRs guide the deployment and operation of ISR assets, ensuring that the right information is collected at the right time and place.

3. **Facilitate Coordination and Synchronization**: SIRs help synchronize intelligence collection efforts with operational activities, ensuring that intelligence supports the overall mission and is collected in a coordinated manner.

4. **Ensure Timely and Relevant Intelligence**: SIRs prioritize the collection of critical information, ensuring that commanders receive timely and relevant intelligence that supports decision-making at key moments.

## Components of Specific Intelligence Requirements (SIRs)

A well-formulated SIR includes several key components to ensure clarity and effectiveness:

1. **What**: Specifies the exact information needed. This could include details about enemy capabilities, positions, movements, intentions, or environmental conditions.

2. **Where**: Defines the geographical area or specific location where the information needs to be collected. This could be a grid coordinate, a specific region, or a general area of interest (AOI).

3. **When**: Outlines the timeframe within which the information must be collected. This can be an exact date and time, a time window, or a continuous requirement.

4. **Who**: Identifies the ISR asset or unit responsible for collecting the information. This includes specifying which sensor, platform, or personnel are tasked with the collection effort.

5. **Why**: Explains the purpose of the requirement and how the information will support the commander’s decision-making and overall mission objectives.

6. **How**: Provides guidance on the method of collection, if necessary, such as the use of specific sensors (e.g., radar, imagery) or intelligence disciplines (e.g., HUMINT, SIGINT).

### Example of a Specific Intelligence Requirement (SIR)

**Requirement**: Determine the presence and strength of enemy armored units near Bridge Alpha.

- **What**: The number and types of enemy armored vehicles within 5 kilometers of Bridge Alpha.
- **Where**: Area centered on grid coordinate XY1234, extending 5 kilometers in all directions.
- **When**: Within the next 24 hours, with continuous monitoring every 6 hours.
- **Who**: Task UAV Recon Squadron Bravo with collecting and reporting this information.
- **Why**: To assess enemy threat levels and decide whether to commit additional forces to defend Bridge Alpha.
- **How**: Use infrared sensors to detect vehicle heat signatures and high-resolution cameras to identify vehicle types.

## Developing Specific Intelligence Requirements (SIRs)

The process of developing SIRs involves breaking down broader intelligence needs into specific, actionable tasks. This process ensures that all ISR assets are effectively utilized and aligned with the mission's objectives.

### Steps in Developing SIRs

1. **Analyze Priority Intelligence Requirements (PIRs) and FFIRs**

Begin by reviewing the **Priority Intelligence Requirements (PIRs)** and **Friendly Force Information Requirements (FFIRs)** to understand the overall intelligence needs. PIRs and FFIRs provide the foundation for developing SIRs, as they represent the critical information that commanders need to make decisions.

#### Example:

- **PIR**: Determine the enemy’s capability to launch an artillery attack on Forward Operating Base (FOB) Delta.
- **FFIR**: Assess the supply levels of ammunition at FOB Delta.

2. **Identify Key Information Gaps and Decision Points**

Identify specific information gaps that need to be filled to address the PIRs and FFIRs. These gaps represent the unknowns that, if answered, would provide valuable insights for decision-making.

#### Example:

- **Information Gap**: Lack of precise information on enemy artillery positions within range of FOB Delta.
- **Decision Point**: Decide whether to conduct a preemptive strike against enemy artillery based on their proximity and readiness.

3. **Break Down Broad Requirements into Specific Tasks**

Translate the broad PIRs and FFIRs into more detailed and specific questions that directly address the information gaps. This involves asking specific questions about what information is needed, where, when, and how it should be collected.

#### Example:

- **SIR**: Identify the exact locations and readiness status of enemy artillery batteries within a 20-kilometer radius of FOB Delta.

4. **Determine Collection Priorities**

Prioritize the SIRs based on their importance to the mission and the urgency of the need for information. This prioritization ensures that the most critical information is collected first and that ISR resources are allocated effectively.

#### Prioritization Criteria:

- **Impact on Mission Success**: How crucial the information is to achieving the mission objectives.
- **Urgency**: How quickly the information is needed to make a decision.
- **Resource Availability**: The availability and capabilities of ISR assets to collect the required information.

5. **Task and Allocate ISR Assets**

Assign specific collection tasks to ISR assets based on their capabilities, availability, and location. Ensure that each SIR is matched with the most appropriate asset to optimize the collection effort.

#### Example:

- **Tasking**: Assign the task of locating enemy artillery to a combination of SIGINT and UAV units, utilizing SIGINT to detect radio communications and UAVs to visually confirm artillery positions.

6. **Establish Collection Timelines and Synchronize Efforts**

Define the timelines for collecting the information and ensure that collection efforts are synchronized with operational activities. This ensures that intelligence is available when needed for decision-making.

#### Example:

- **Timeline**: SIGINT units to monitor enemy communications continuously for the next 48 hours. UAV units to conduct reconnaissance missions every 6 hours, starting at 0600 hours.

7. **Monitor Collection Progress and Adjust as Needed**

Regularly monitor the progress of collection efforts and adjust the SIRs or tasking as needed based on changes in the operational environment or new intelligence needs. Flexibility is crucial to adapt to dynamic situations.

#### Example:

- **Adjustment**: If initial SIGINT intercepts indicate heavy enemy radio traffic, prioritize UAV reconnaissance in areas with the highest signal activity.

## Tools and Techniques for Managing Specific Intelligence Requirements

Effective management of SIRs involves several tools and techniques to ensure clarity, coordination, and responsiveness:

### 1. **Collection Management Software**

**Collection Management Software** helps automate the tasking and tracking of ISR assets. These tools provide a centralized platform for managing SIRs, monitoring collection progress, and adjusting tasking as needed.

### 2. **Collection Requirement Matrix**

A **Collection Requirement Matrix** is a visual tool used to organize and prioritize SIRs, assign collection tasks, and monitor the status of collection efforts. The matrix typically includes:

- The specific SIR.
- The priority level (high, medium, low).
- The assigned ISR asset or unit.
- The timeline for collection and reporting.
- Notes or comments on progress or challenges.

### 3. **Geospatial Information Systems (GIS)**

**GIS Tools** are used to visualize and analyze the spatial dimensions of SIRs, collection assets, and targets. GIS helps optimize ISR asset positioning and ensures coverage of critical areas of interest.

### 4. **ISR Synchronization Matrix**

An **ISR Synchronization Matrix** helps coordinate ISR activities with other operational activities, ensuring that intelligence collection efforts are aligned with the overall operational plan. It shows the timing and sequencing of collection tasks, highlighting potential overlaps and ensuring comprehensive coverage of the operational environment.

### 5. **Regular Briefings and Feedback Loops**

Regular briefings and feedback loops between intelligence planners, ISR operators, and decision-makers help ensure that SIRs remain relevant and aligned with mission objectives. Feedback allows for timely adjustments to SIRs and collection efforts based on new information or changes in the operational environment.

## Conclusion

**Specific Intelligence Requirements (SIRs)** are essential components of intelligence planning and collection, providing detailed, actionable tasks that guide ISR operations. By breaking down broad intelligence needs into specific tasks, SIRs ensure that intelligence efforts are focused, coordinated, and effective in supporting mission objectives. The development and management of SIRs require careful planning, prioritization, and flexibility, leveraging various tools and techniques to optimize intelligence collection in dynamic and complex environments.
