### Wake

A **wake** refers to the region of disturbed flow that forms downstream of a moving object through a fluid, such as air or water. This disturbed flow is characterized by complex patterns of vortices, turbulence, and velocity deficits relative to the undisturbed fluid. Wakes are significant in a variety of contexts, including aerodynamics, [[hydrodynamics]], and environmental fluid dynamics, as they influence the drag on the object, the flow field around it, and the impact on downstream regions.

### Key Concepts

1. **Flow Separation**:
   - **Boundary Layer**: As a fluid flows over an object, a boundary layer forms near the surface due to the no-slip condition, where the fluid velocity is zero relative to the object.
   - **Separation Point**: Depending on the shape of the object and the flow conditions, the boundary layer may separate from the surface, leading to the formation of a wake. The point where this separation occurs is called the separation point.

2. **Velocity Deficit**:
   - **Reduced Velocity**: In the wake, the fluid velocity is generally lower than the free-stream velocity (the undisturbed flow far upstream of the object). This velocity deficit is due to the drag force exerted on the object, which slows down the fluid.
   - **Recovery**: The velocity in the wake gradually recovers as the fluid moves downstream, but this recovery depends on factors such as the shape of the object, the Reynolds number, and the level of turbulence.

3. **Vortex Shedding**:
   - **Kármán Vortex Street**: For certain flow conditions, particularly around bluff bodies (objects with a blunt shape), the wake can become unsteady, leading to periodic shedding of vortices from alternate sides of the object. This pattern is known as a Kármán vortex street and is characterized by a regular array of vortices that alternate in sign.
   - **Strouhal Number**: The frequency of vortex shedding is related to the object's size and the flow speed and is typically expressed using the Strouhal number \( \text{St} = \frac{fL}{U} \), where \( f \) is the shedding frequency, \( L \) is a characteristic length (such as the diameter of a cylinder), and \( U \) is the free-stream velocity.

4. **Turbulence**:
   - **Wake Turbulence**: The wake region is often highly turbulent, especially in the case of bluff bodies. Turbulence in the wake contributes to mixing, energy dissipation, and the diffusion of momentum.
   - **Reynolds Number**: The characteristics of the wake, including its size, shape, and turbulence intensity, are strongly influenced by the Reynolds number, \( \text{Re} = \frac{\rho U L}{\mu} \), where \( \rho \) is the fluid density, \( U \) is the free-stream velocity, \( L \) is the characteristic length, and \( \mu \) is the fluid's dynamic viscosity. At higher Reynolds numbers, wakes tend to be more turbulent.

5. **Drag Force**:
   - **Pressure Drag**: The presence of a wake is associated with pressure drag (also known as form drag), which arises due to the pressure difference between the front and rear of the object. The wake contributes to this pressure difference by lowering the pressure in the region directly behind the object.
   - **Skin Friction Drag**: In addition to pressure drag, skin friction drag, which results from viscous shear forces in the boundary layer, also contributes to the overall drag on the object.

### Types of Wakes

1. **Laminar and Turbulent Wakes**:
   - **Laminar Wakes**: At low Reynolds numbers, the wake can remain laminar, characterized by smooth, orderly layers of fluid. Laminar wakes are typically narrow and symmetric.
   - **Turbulent Wakes**: At higher Reynolds numbers, the wake becomes turbulent, with chaotic, irregular motion. Turbulent wakes are wider and more diffusive, with increased mixing and energy dissipation.

2. **Wakes Behind Bluff Bodies**:
   - **Bluff Bodies**: Bluff bodies, such as cylinders, spheres, or flat plates, have broad, flat surfaces that cause significant flow separation, leading to large wakes. These wakes are prone to vortex shedding and are typically turbulent.
   - **Kármán Vortex Street**: As mentioned earlier, the wake behind bluff bodies at certain Reynolds numbers can form a Kármán vortex street, with alternating vortices creating oscillatory forces on the object and affecting downstream flow.

3. **Wakes Behind Streamlined Bodies**:
   - **Streamlined Bodies**: Streamlined bodies, such as airfoils, have shapes designed to minimize flow separation and reduce the wake size. The wake behind streamlined bodies is typically smaller, with lower turbulence and drag.
   - **Wake Collapse**: In highly streamlined flows, the wake can collapse quickly, with the fluid returning to nearly free-stream conditions relatively soon downstream of the object.

4. **Propeller and Jet Wakes**:
   - **Propeller Wakes**: The wake behind a rotating propeller or fan is characterized by helical vortices and complex interactions between the induced velocity fields. These wakes can influence the performance of the propulsion system and interact with nearby structures or fluid regions.
   - **Jet Wakes**: Jets, such as those from aircraft engines or industrial nozzles, produce wakes characterized by high-speed turbulent mixing, leading to rapid momentum transfer and diffusion. Jet wakes are important in the study of mixing, dispersion, and noise generation.

### Applications and Importance

1. **Aerodynamics and Hydrodynamics**:
   - **Aircraft Design**: Understanding wakes is crucial in aircraft design to minimize drag and reduce fuel consumption. Wake turbulence, particularly from wingtip vortices, is a significant factor in aircraft spacing during takeoff and landing.
   - **Automotive Engineering**: In automotive design, reducing the wake behind a vehicle is essential for improving fuel efficiency and reducing drag. Techniques such as streamlining, adding spoilers, and using vortex generators help manage the wake and minimize its impact.

2. **Naval Architecture**:
   - **Ship Design**: Wakes are important in ship design, where reducing the wake can decrease drag and improve fuel efficiency. The wake's interaction with the ship's hull and propeller also affects noise and cavitation, which can influence stealth and operational performance.
   - **Wake Effects on Marine Life**: Wakes generated by ships can impact marine life, particularly in shallow waters where the wake-induced turbulence can disturb sediments and affect ecosystems.

3. **Environmental and Atmospheric Sciences**:
   - **Wind Farms**: In wind farms, the wake generated by upstream turbines can reduce the wind speed and increase turbulence for downstream turbines, affecting their efficiency and lifespan. Understanding and managing these wakes is crucial for optimizing wind farm layout and performance.
   - **Urban Planning**: Wakes generated by buildings in urban areas can influence wind flow, pollution dispersion, and thermal comfort. Designing buildings to manage or exploit wakes can improve urban air quality and reduce energy consumption.

4. **Fluid Mechanics Research**:
   - **Fundamental Studies**: The study of wakes is fundamental in fluid mechanics, providing insights into turbulence, vortex dynamics, and flow separation. Wakes are a classic example of shear layers and boundary layer interactions, making them a critical area of research.
   - **Experimental and Computational Fluid Dynamics**: Wakes are studied using experimental techniques such as wind tunnels, water channels, and particle image velocimetry (PIV). Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are also widely used to model wake behavior and predict the impact of design changes on wake characteristics.

### Conclusion

**Wakes** are a complex and fascinating aspect of fluid dynamics, with significant implications across a wide range of fields, from aerodynamics and naval architecture to environmental science and engineering. Understanding the formation, structure, and effects of wakes is crucial for optimizing designs, improving efficiency, and mitigating adverse impacts on the environment and human activities. Advances in both experimental and computational methods continue to enhance our ability to analyze and control wakes, leading to better designs and deeper insights into the behavior of fluids in motion.
