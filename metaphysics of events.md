# Metaphysics of Events

[[Events]] occupy a central place in our ontology, alongside [[objects]], [[properties]], and [[states of affairs]]. The metaphysics of events addresses fundamental questions about their nature, individuation, causal roles, and relation to other ontological categories.

## Ontological Status

Events can be characterized formally as:

$$E = \langle O, P, T, L \rangle$$

Where:
- $O$ is a set of objects (participants)
- $P$ is a property or relation
- $T$ is a temporal specification
- $L$ is a location

This raises the question of whether events are:
- [[Primitive]] (irreducible ontological entities)
- [[Derived]] (constructed from other ontological categories)
- [[Eliminable]] (reducible to object properties at times)

## Theories of Event Identity

### Davidson's Coarse-Grained Approach

Donald Davidson proposed a [[coarse-grained]] criterion for event identity:

$$e_1 = e_2 \iff \forall c(c \text{ causes } e_1 \leftrightarrow c \text{ causes } e_2) \land \forall e(e_1 \text{ causes } e \leftrightarrow e_2 \text{ causes } e)$$

Events are identical if and only if they have the same causes and effects.

### Kim's Fine-Grained Approach

Jaegwon Kim proposed a [[fine-grained]] criterion:

$$e_1 = e_2 \iff [x_1 = x_2 \land P_1 = P_2 \land t_1 = t_2]$$

Where:
- $x$ is the object
- $P$ is the property
- $t$ is the time

Under this view, events are property exemplifications at times by objects.

### Lewis's Approach

David Lewis proposed that events are [[spatiotemporal regions]] with certain properties:

$$e = \{r | r \text{ is a spatiotemporal region} \land P(r)\}$$

## Persistence and Temporal Structure

### Endurance vs. Perdurance

Do events [[endure]] (exist wholly at each moment) or [[perdure]] (have temporal parts)?

$$\text{Perdures}(e) \iff \exists t_1, t_2, e_1, e_2 (t_1 \neq t_2 \land \text{TemporalPartAt}(e_1, e, t_1) \land \text{TemporalPartAt}(e_2, e, t_2))$$

Most philosophers hold that events perdure, having different temporal parts at different times.

### Temporal Mereology

Events have temporal parts related by [[mereological]] operations:

$$e_3 = e_1 \oplus e_2 \iff \forall t(\text{OccursAt}(e_3, t) \leftrightarrow \text{OccursAt}(e_1, t) \lor \text{OccursAt}(e_2, t))$$

Where $\oplus$ represents mereological sum.

## Causation and Events

Events are typically considered the primary [[relata of causation]]:

$$\text{Causes}(e_1, e_2)$$

This raises questions about:
- [[Causal transitivity]]: If $e_1$ causes $e_2$ and $e_2$ causes $e_3$, does $e_1$ cause $e_3$?
- [[Causal overdetermination]]: Can multiple events independently suffice to cause an effect?
- [[Causal preemption]]: How do we handle cases where one causal chain preempts another?

## Types vs. Tokens

The distinction between [[event types]] and [[event tokens]] is formalized as:

$$\text{Token}(e) \iff \exists t, l(\text{OccursAt}(e, t) \land \text{OccursAt}(e, l))$$

$$\text{Type}(E) \iff \forall e(e \in E \rightarrow \text{Token}(e) \land \text{Exemplifies}(e, P))$$

Where:
- $e$ is an event token
- $E$ is an event type
- $P$ is the defining property of the type

## Action Events

Some events are [[actions]], which raises special questions about agency:

$$\text{Action}(e) \iff \exists a, i(\text{Agent}(a) \land \text{Intention}(i) \land \text{CausedBy}(e, a, i))$$

This connects to debates about:
- [[Free will]] and [[determinism]]
- [[Mental causation]]
- [[Problem of action individuation]]

## Linguistic Representation

The semantics of event talk involves:

$$\exists e(\text{Singing}(e) \land \text{Agent}(e, \text{Mary}) \land \text{Time}(e, \text{yesterday}))$$

This [[Davidsonian semantics]] treats events as implicit arguments of verbs.

## Modal Properties

Questions about the [[modal properties]] of events include:
- Could a particular event have occurred differently?
- Are events [[essentially]] tied to their actual participants?
- Do events have [[counterfactual identity]] conditions?

$$\Diamond(e \text{ occurs} \land \neg P(e)) \stackrel{?}{\iff} \neg\square(e \text{ occurs} \rightarrow P(e))$$

## Events vs. Other Ontological Categories

### Events vs. Objects

The distinction between [[events]] and [[objects]] can be characterized:

$$\text{Object}(x) \iff \text{Persistent}(x) \land \text{Spatially bounded}(x) \land \neg\text{Temporal part of anything}(x)$$

$$\text{Event}(e) \iff \text{Temporal}(e) \land \text{Has temporal parts}(e) \land \text{Causal efficacy}(e)$$

### Events vs. States

[[Events]] vs. [[states]]:

$$\text{Event}(e) \iff \text{Dynamic}(e) \land \text{Has temporal boundaries}(e)$$

$$\text{State}(s) \iff \text{Static}(s) \land \text{Homogeneous}(s)$$

### Events vs. Processes

[[Events]] vs. [[processes]]:

$$\text{Event}(e) \iff \text{Telic}(e) \land \text{Has culmination}(e)$$

$$\text{Process}(p) \iff \text{Atelic}(p) \land \neg\text{Has culmination}(p)$$

## Philosophical Applications

The metaphysics of events has implications for:

### Philosophy of Mind

Mental events and their relation to physical events:

$$\text{Mental}(e) \land \text{Physical}(e') \land \text{Causes}(e, e') \stackrel{?}{\implies} \text{Reduction or Supervenience Relation}(e, e')$$

### Philosophy of Time

The relation between events and temporal ontology:

$$\text{Presentism} \iff \forall e(\text{Exists}(e) \rightarrow \text{Present}(e))$$

$$\text{Eternalism} \iff \forall e, t(\text{OccursAt}(e, t) \rightarrow \text{Exists}(e))$$

### Philosophy of Language

Event semantics and linguistic meaning:

$$\text{Meaning}(\text{"John walked slowly"}) = \exists e(\text{Walking}(e) \land \text{Agent}(e, \text{John}) \land \text{Slow}(e))$$

## Research Frontiers

Current research explores:
- [[Dynamic events]] in computational ontologies
- The role of [[virtual events]] in digital contexts
- [[Quantum event structures]] and their implications
- [[Cross-cultural event conceptualization]]
- [[Event cognition]] and its neural basis
