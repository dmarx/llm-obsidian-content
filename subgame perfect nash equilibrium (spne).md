subgame perfect Nash equilibrium

### Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium (SPNE)

A **Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium (SPNE)** is a refinement of the [[Nash Equilibrium]] concept in game theory, ensuring that strategies constitute a Nash Equilibrium not just for the game as a whole but for every subgame of the original game. It is particularly useful in analyzing [[dynamic games|games with sequential moves]] where players make decisions at different stages.

---

#### Definition

A strategy profile \( \sigma^* = (\sigma_1^*, \sigma_2^*, \ldots, \sigma_N^*) \) is a Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium if:

1. \( \sigma^* \) is a Nash Equilibrium for the entire game.
2. For every proper subgame \( G' \) of the original game \( G \), the restriction of \( \sigma^* \) to \( G' \) (denoted \( \sigma^* |_{G'} \)) is also a Nash Equilibrium of \( G' \).

---

#### Key Properties

1. **Backward Induction**: SPNE is typically derived using backward induction in finite games with perfect information. Backward induction involves solving the game starting from the last possible decision nodes and proceeding backward to the first decision node.
2. **Robustness in Subgames**: Unlike a Nash Equilibrium, an SPNE remains optimal even if players find themselves in a subgame not reached in equilibrium play.

---

#### Formal Example: Extensive-Form Game

Consider a two-player game in extensive form:

1. **Player 1** chooses \( A \) or \( B \).
2. If \( A \), Player 2 chooses \( C \) or \( D \).
3. If \( B \), the game ends, and payoffs are directly assigned.

The extensive form can be represented as:

- \( A \) → \( C \): Payoffs \( (3, 2) \)
- \( A \) → \( D \): Payoffs \( (1, 4) \)
- \( B \): Payoffs \( (2, 3) \)

To solve for the SPNE:
1. Start at Player 2's decision node:
   - If Player 2 is to move, they choose \( C \) if \( (3, 2) \succ (1, 4) \) for their utility.
   - Otherwise, they choose \( D \).
2. Using Player 2's optimal choice, Player 1 decides between \( A \) (considering Player 2's response) and \( B \).
   - If \( A \) leads to higher utility for Player 1 than \( B \), Player 1 chooses \( A \).

---

#### Mathematical Framework

For a dynamic game with perfect information, the SPNE can be characterized mathematically using **backward induction**:

1. Let \( V_i(h) \) denote the value function for player \( i \) at history \( h \) (a sequence of actions).
2. For a terminal history \( h_T \), \( V_i(h_T) = u_i(h_T) \), where \( u_i \) is the utility function.
3. For a non-terminal history \( h \), players choose actions \( a \in A(h) \) to maximize their expected utility:
   $$ V_i(h) = \max_{a \in A(h)} \left( \sum_{h' \in H(h, a)} \Pr(h' \mid h, a) V_i(h') \right), $$
   where \( H(h, a) \) are successor histories, and \( \Pr(h' \mid h, a) \) is the probability of reaching \( h' \) after \( h \) and \( a \).

Backward induction is applied recursively from terminal histories to the root.

#### Infinite and Imperfect Information Cases

1. **Infinite Games**: For games with infinite horizons or state spaces, SPNE is defined using limiting arguments, such as the use of fixed-point theorems to ensure strategies are optimal for all subgames.
2. **Imperfect Information**: In games with imperfect information, backward induction is replaced with **belief-based methods**, like solving for a **Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium (PBE)**, which generalizes SPNE.

#### Comparison to Nash Equilibrium

| Feature                      | Nash Equilibrium              | Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Applicability                | Static and dynamic games      | Primarily dynamic games          |
| Robustness in subgames       | Not guaranteed                | Guaranteed                       |
| Solution Method              | Best response conditions      | Backward induction or refinement |

By ruling out equilibria relying on non-credible threats, SPNE enhances the predictive power of [[game theory]] in dynamic settings.
