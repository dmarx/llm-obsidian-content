5 whys


**ASSISTANT**

The "5 Whys" is a problem-solving technique developed by Sakichi Toyoda and widely used within the Toyota Motor Corporation during its manufacturing process improvements. This method is designed to explore the cause-and-effect relationships underlying a particular problem. The goal is to determine the root cause of a defect or problem by repeating the question "Why?" five times. Each answer forms the basis of the next question. The "5 Whys" is a simple yet powerful tool for uncovering the essence of any problem and can be used in almost any situation.

### How the 5 Whys Works

1. **Identify the Problem**: Start with a clear and concise statement of the problem. This problem statement should be specific and based on actual events rather than hypothetical situations.

2. **Ask the First Why**: Ask why the problem is occurring. This involves observing and describing the issues as they happen in the process or system.

3. **Ask "Why?" Four More Times**: For each response you generate from the previous 'why' question, ask another "Why?" This iterative questioning leads you deeper into the problem.

4. **Determine the Root Cause**: Continue the questioning process until you reach the underlying cause of the problem, which often occurs by the time you ask "Why?" for the fifth time. However, you may sometimes find the root cause before reaching the fifth "Why?" or you may need to continue beyond five whys.

5. **Develop Countermeasures**: Once the root cause is identified, the next step is to develop countermeasures that prevent the recurrence of the problem.

### Example of the 5 Whys

**Problem Statement**: A vehicle will not start.

1. **Why?** - The battery is dead. (First why)
2. **Why?** - The alternator is not functioning. (Second why)
3. **Why?** - The alternator belt has broken. (Third why)
4. **Why?** - The alternator belt was well beyond its useful service life and not replaced. (Fourth why)
5. **Why?** - The vehicle was not maintained according to the recommended service schedule. (Fifth why, root cause)

**Solution**: Revise the maintenance schedule and ensure compliance, possibly adding a reminder system for future maintenance checks.

### Benefits of the 5 Whys

- **Simplicity**: It does not require statistical analysis or other advanced tools.
- **Effectiveness**: Quickly helps to separate symptoms from causes and to identify the root cause of a problem.
- **Improves Problem-Solving Skills**: By repeatedly asking why, team members learn to think critically and deeply about problems.

### Limitations of the 5 Whys

- **Oversimplification**: For complex issues, the root cause may not be unveiled after only five iterations or the technique may oversimplify the pathways of causality.
- **Bias**: The effectiveness of the 5 Whys can depend heavily on the insight and experience of the person leading the session. Biases can lead to incorrect root cause identification.
- **Lack of Rigor**: It might not be systematic enough to identify the root cause for complicated problems, where interrelated causes exist.

### Best Practices

- Use the 5 Whys in conjunction with other methods like fishbone diagrams or fault tree analysis for more comprehensive analysis.
- Document each session for future reference and organizational learning.
- Ensure a culture of openness and non-blame to encourage honest and effective answers.

The 5 Whys can be a potent tool for any organization aiming to improve their operations continuously. When applied correctly, it can unveil significant insights that lead to lasting improvements.
