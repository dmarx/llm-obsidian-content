### Empirical Evidence on Progressive Taxation and Economic Growth

Empirical studies provide insights into the effects of progressive taxation on economic growth. Contrary to the concerns that progressive taxes might discourage investment and work effort, research often indicates that moderate levels of progressive taxation do not significantly harm economic growth. Here are key findings from the literature:

### Key Empirical Findings

1. **Tax Rates and Economic Growth:**
   - Studies have found that moderate progressive taxes do not negatively impact economic growth. For example, Peter Diamond and Emmanuel Saez, in their comprehensive analysis, argue that optimal tax rates on high earners can be significantly higher than current rates without adverse effects on economic growth  .

2. **Income Redistribution and Growth:**
   - Research by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) suggests that income redistribution through progressive taxation can enhance growth by reducing inequality. Their findings indicate that lower inequality is associated with faster and more sustainable growth .
   
3. **Effects on Labor Supply:**
   - Studies examining the labor supply response to taxation, such as those by Henrik Kleven and Camille Landais, show that labor supply is relatively inelastic, meaning that higher tax rates do not substantially reduce work effort among high earners .
   
4. **Investment and Savings:**
   - Research indicates that progressive taxation does not significantly deter investment. For instance, a study by Austan Goolsbee found that high-income taxpayers do not drastically reduce their investment activities in response to higher tax rates .

5. **International Comparisons:**
   - Cross-country comparisons by Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez, and Stefanie Stantcheva show that countries with higher top marginal tax rates, such as Scandinavian countries, do not experience lower economic growth compared to those with lower tax rates. These countries often exhibit robust economic performance and high standards of living .

### Mechanisms Supporting Growth

Several mechanisms explain why progressive taxation might not harm and could potentially support economic growth:

1. **Public Investment:**
   - Revenues from progressive taxes fund public investments in infrastructure, education, and healthcare, which enhance human capital and productivity, leading to long-term economic growth.
   
2. **Reduction in Inequality:**
   - Lower levels of inequality contribute to social stability and broader participation in the economy. This can increase aggregate demand and foster a more inclusive growth trajectory.

3. **Increased Consumer Spending:**
   - Redistribution of income through progressive taxes often leads to increased spending by lower-income households, who are more likely to spend additional income, thereby stimulating economic demand.

4. **Human Capital Development:**
   - Progressive taxation funds education and training programs, helping to create a more skilled and productive workforce. This investment in human capital is crucial for sustaining economic growth.

### Conclusion

Empirical studies suggest that moderate progressive taxation does not significantly harm economic growth. Instead, it can support growth by reducing inequality, funding public investments, and enhancing social stability. The evidence points to the benefits of a well-designed progressive tax system that balances revenue generation with maintaining economic incentives. This aligns with John Rawls's principles of justice, promoting fairness and improving the well-being of the least advantaged members of society.
