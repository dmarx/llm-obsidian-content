title: physical phenomenon whereby waves elongate as they travel

**USER**

the physical phenomenon whereby waves elongate as they travel


**ASSISTANT**

The user is asking about the physical phenomenon where waves elongate as they travel. This sounds like they're referring to wave dispersion - the phenomenon where different frequency components of a wave travel at different speeds, causing the wave packet to spread out over time and distance.

They want me to create a technical wiki entry for an Obsidian vault. I need to:
1. Provide deeply detailed, technical explanations
2. Use mathematical formalisms 
3. Wrap novel phrases in double brackets for wiki links
4. Propose symbolic notation
5. Be technical for someone with grad degrees in applied math/stats/philosophy of science
6. Explain physics notation in accessible mathematical terms
7. Write as a wiki page, not conversationally

Let me structure this as a comprehensive wiki entry on wave dispersion, covering:
- Definition and mathematical formulation
- Dispersion relation
- Group velocity vs phase velocity
- Examples in different media
- Mathematical analysis of wave packet spreading
- Applications and implications

I should use detailed mathematical notation and explain the physics conventions clearly.# [[Wave Dispersion]]

## Definition

[[Wave dispersion]] refers to the phenomenon whereby the [[phase velocity]] of a wave depends on its [[frequency]] or [[wavelength]], causing [[wave packets]] to spread spatially and temporally during propagation. This frequency-dependent propagation velocity results in the separation of different [[spectral components]] within a composite wave.

## Mathematical Framework

### Dispersion Relation

The fundamental characterization of dispersion is encoded in the [[dispersion relation]] $\omega = \omega(k)$, where:
- $\omega$ denotes the [[angular frequency]] (radians per unit time)
- $k$ represents the [[wave number]] (radians per unit length)

For a general medium, this relation takes the form:
$$\omega = f(k, \text{medium parameters})$$

### Phase Velocity

The [[phase velocity]] $v_p$ describes the speed at which constant phase surfaces propagate:
$$v_p = \frac{\omega}{k}$$

### Group Velocity

The [[group velocity]] $v_g$ characterizes the propagation speed of [[wave packet envelopes]]:
$$v_g = \frac{d\omega}{dk}$$

When $v_g \neq v_p$, the medium exhibits [[dispersive behavior]].

## Types of Dispersion

### Normal Dispersion
$$\frac{d^2\omega}{dk^2} > 0$$
Higher frequency components travel faster than lower frequency components.

### Anomalous Dispersion  
$$\frac{d^2\omega}{dk^2} < 0$$
Lower frequency components outpace higher frequency components.

## Wave Packet Evolution

Consider an initial [[Gaussian wave packet]]:
$$\psi(x,0) = A_0 \exp\left(-\frac{(x-x_0)^2}{2\sigma_0^2}\right) \exp(ik_0 x)$$

Under dispersive propagation, the packet evolves as:
$$\psi(x,t) = \frac{A_0\sigma_0}{\sigma(t)} \exp\left(-\frac{(x-x_0-v_g t)^2}{2\sigma(t)^2}\right) \exp(i k_0 x - i\omega_0 t + i\phi(x,t))$$

where the [[temporal width evolution]] follows:
$$\sigma(t) = \sigma_0 \sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{t}{\tau_d}\right)^2}$$

The [[dispersion time]] $\tau_d$ is defined as:
$$\tau_d = \frac{\sigma_0^2}{\left|\frac{d^2\omega}{dk^2}\right|_{k=k_0}}$$

## Mathematical Analysis of Spreading

### Spectral Decomposition
For a wave packet with initial [[spectral amplitude]] $\tilde{\psi}_0(k)$:
$$\psi(x,t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \tilde{\psi}_0(k) \exp(ikx - i\omega(k)t) dk$$

### Taylor Expansion of Dispersion Relation
Around the central wave number $k_0$:
$$\omega(k) \approx \omega_0 + v_g(k-k_0) + \frac{1}{2}\beta_2(k-k_0)^2 + \frac{1}{6}\beta_3(k-k_0)^3 + \cdots$$

where:
- $\beta_2 = \left.\frac{d^2\omega}{dk^2}\right|_{k=k_0}$ ([[group velocity dispersion]] parameter)
- $\beta_3 = \left.\frac{d^3\omega}{dk^3}\right|_{k=k_0}$ ([[third-order dispersion]] parameter)

### Quantitative Spreading Metrics

The [[root-mean-square width]] evolution:
$$\langle (\Delta x)^2 \rangle(t) = \langle (\Delta x)^2 \rangle(0) + \beta_2^2 t^2 \langle (\Delta k)^2 \rangle(0)$$

where $\langle (\Delta k)^2 \rangle(0)$ represents the initial [[spectral width]].

## Physical Examples

### Electromagnetic Waves in Dielectric Media
The [[refractive index]] $n(\omega)$ determines the dispersion relation:
$$\omega = \frac{ck}{n(\omega)}$$

This implicit relation must be solved for $\omega(k)$.

### Deep Water Gravity Waves
$$\omega = \sqrt{gk}$$
where $g$ is gravitational acceleration, yielding:
- $v_p = \sqrt{\frac{g}{k}}$
- $v_g = \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{g}{k}} = \frac{v_p}{2}$

### Quantum Mechanical Wave Packets
For a free particle with mass $m$:
$$\omega = \frac{\hbar k^2}{2m}$$

The [[de Broglie wavelength]] $\lambda = \frac{h}{p} = \frac{2\pi}{k}$ connects to the [[momentum-energy relation]].

## Information-Theoretic Perspective

### Entropy Evolution
The [[Shannon entropy]] of the spatial probability distribution $|\psi(x,t)|^2$ increases monotonically:
$$S(t) = -\int |\psi(x,t)|^2 \log|\psi(x,t)|^2 dx$$

### Uncertainty Relations
The [[time-bandwidth product]] imposes fundamental limits:
$$\Delta t \cdot \Delta \omega \geq \frac{1}{2}$$

Combined with dispersion, this yields the [[space-time uncertainty relation]]:
$$\Delta x(t) \cdot \Delta k \geq \frac{1}{2}$$

## Symbolic Notation Proposal

Let $\mathcal{D}[\psi](x,t)$ denote the [[dispersion operator]] acting on wave function $\psi$:
$$\mathcal{D}[\psi](x,t) = \mathcal{F}^{-1}\left[e^{-i\omega(k)t} \mathcal{F}[\psi](k,0)\right](x)$$

where $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{F}^{-1}$ represent the [[Fourier transform]] and its inverse.

The [[dispersion strength]] can be quantified via the [[normalized dispersion parameter]]:
$$D = \frac{\beta_2 L}{T_0^2}$$

where $L$ is the propagation distance and $T_0$ is the initial [[pulse duration]].
