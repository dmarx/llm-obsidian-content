**USER**

fiber functor


**ASSISTANT**

A **fiber functor** is a key concept in the theory of tensor categories and is essential in Tannaka–Krein duality, where it provides a bridge between abstract categories of representations and concrete vector spaces. The fiber functor allows us to reconstruct algebraic structures (such as groups or quantum groups) from their categories of representations.

### Definition

Let \( \mathcal{C} \) be a **tensor category** (a category with a monoidal structure, meaning it has an associative "tensor product" operation and a unit object). A **fiber functor** is a **faithful, exact, monoidal functor** from \( \mathcal{C} \) to the category of finite-dimensional vector spaces over a field \( k \), denoted \( \text{Vect}_k \). In symbols, a fiber functor is a functor

$$
F : \mathcal{C} \to \text{Vect}_k
$$

that satisfies the following properties:

1. **Faithfulness**: The functor is **injective** on the set of morphisms. If \( F(f) = F(g) \) for two morphisms \( f, g : X \to Y \) in \( \mathcal{C} \), then \( f = g \). This ensures that the functor captures the structure of morphisms in \( \mathcal{C} \).

2. **Exactness**: The functor preserves short exact sequences. If \( 0 \to A \to B \to C \to 0 \) is an exact sequence in \( \mathcal{C} \), then \( 0 \to F(A) \to F(B) \to F(C) \to 0 \) is exact in \( \text{Vect}_k \). This property is crucial for ensuring that the fiber functor respects the algebraic structure in the representations.

3. **Monoidal Structure**: The functor preserves the tensor product. That is, for any objects \( X, Y \in \mathcal{C} \), we have a natural isomorphism

$$
F(X \otimes Y) \cong F(X) \otimes F(Y)
$$

and

$$
F(\mathbf{1}) \cong k,
$$

where \( \mathbf{1} \) is the unit object in \( \mathcal{C} \) (which acts as the identity for the tensor product, typically analogous to the trivial representation in representation theory), and \( k \) is the ground field (since the unit object in \( \text{Vect}_k \) is \( k \), the 1-dimensional vector space).

### Intuition

A fiber functor provides a way to assign **concrete vector spaces** to the abstract objects in the category \( \mathcal{C} \), while preserving the structure given by the tensor product and morphisms between objects. It maps representations of a group (or more general objects in \( \mathcal{C} \)) to vector spaces, allowing us to study these representations in the familiar setting of linear algebra.

In the context of **Tannaka–Krein duality**, the fiber functor plays a critical role in the **reconstruction of the group** from its category of representations. Specifically, the automorphisms of the fiber functor are isomorphic to the group that underlies the representation category.

### Example: Representations of a Compact Group

For a **compact topological group** \( G \), the category \( \mathcal{Rep}(G) \) consists of the finite-dimensional representations of \( G \). A fiber functor in this setting would map each representation \( \rho: G \to \text{GL}(V) \) to the vector space \( V \) itself. This functor

$$
F: \mathcal{Rep}(G) \to \text{Vect}_k
$$

is faithful and exact because it simply records the vector spaces underlying each representation, preserving the relationships (intertwiners) between representations.

The automorphisms of this fiber functor, denoted \( \text{Aut}^{\otimes}(F) \), are the symmetries of the fiber functor that respect the tensor product structure. In this case, these automorphisms recover the group \( G \) itself:

$$
G \cong \text{Aut}^{\otimes}(F).
$$

Thus, the fiber functor encapsulates all the essential information about the group \( G \) by how it acts on vector spaces.

### Generalization to Other Settings

- **Quantum Groups**: In the case of quantum groups (which generalize classical groups to a non-commutative setting), the fiber functor still assigns vector spaces to representations, and the group-like structure can be reconstructed via \( \text{Aut}^{\otimes}(F) \), but the structure it captures is that of a **quantum group** rather than a classical group.

- **Algebraic Groups**: For **algebraic groups** (groups defined by polynomial equations), fiber functors provide a way to reconstruct the algebraic group from its representation category. This is the essence of **Tannaka duality** in algebraic geometry.

### Formalization in Tannaka–Krein Duality

In the general setting of Tannaka–Krein duality, given a rigid, symmetric monoidal category \( \mathcal{C} \) (which behaves like a category of representations), a fiber functor \( F \) allows one to reconstruct the group \( G \) (or quantum group, or Hopf algebra) whose representations form \( \mathcal{C} \). The group \( G \) is recovered as the group of automorphisms of the fiber functor \( F \):

$$
G \cong \text{Aut}^{\otimes}(F),
$$

where \( \text{Aut}^{\otimes}(F) \) consists of the automorphisms of the functor \( F \) that preserve the monoidal structure (the tensor product of representations).

### Summary of Key Points

- A **fiber functor** is a monoidal functor from a category of representations (or more generally, a tensor category) to the category of vector spaces.
- The fiber functor preserves the algebraic structure of representations, such as exact sequences and tensor products.
- In **Tannaka–Krein duality**, the group (or quantum group) is reconstructed from its representation category via the automorphisms of the fiber functor.
  
This concept is foundational in representation theory, **category theory**, and **non-commutative geometry**. It ties together abstract categorical frameworks with more concrete linear algebraic structures.
