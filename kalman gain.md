# Kalman Gain

The [[Kalman gain]] (denoted as K) is a fundamental concept in [[optimal estimation]] theory that determines how much weight should be given to new measurements versus existing predictions in a [[Kalman filter]]. It represents the optimal weighting factor that minimizes the [[posterior error covariance]].

## Mathematical Formalization

For a system with:
- [[state estimate]] x̂
- [[measurement]] z
- [[measurement matrix]] H
- [[prediction error covariance matrix]] P
- [[measurement noise covariance matrix]] R

The Kalman gain K is defined as:

K = PH^T(HPH^T + R)^{-1}

This formulation emerges from minimizing the [[trace]] of the [[posterior covariance matrix]], representing the optimization of the mean squared error of the state estimate.

## Properties and Interpretation

The Kalman gain exhibits several key properties:

1. **Adaptive Weighting**: K automatically adjusts based on the relative uncertainties of predictions and measurements:
   - When R → 0 (highly accurate measurements): K → H^{-1}
   - When P → 0 (highly accurate predictions): K → 0

2. **Dimensionality**: K ∈ ℝ^{n×m}, where:
   - n is the dimension of the state space
   - m is the dimension of the measurement space

3. **Optimality**: K provides the [[minimum mean square error]] (MMSE) estimate under [[Gaussian noise]] assumptions

## Role in State Update

The Kalman gain is used in the [[measurement update]] equation:

x̂_k = x̂_k^- + K_k(z_k - Hx̂_k^-)

where:
- x̂_k^- is the [[prior state estimate]]
- z_k - Hx̂_k^- is the [[innovation]] or [[measurement residual]]
- x̂_k is the [[posterior state estimate]]

## Information Theory Perspective

From an [[information theory]] viewpoint, the Kalman gain can be interpreted as:

1. A [[precision-weighted average]] between prior and measurement information
2. The optimal solution to a [[Bayesian inference]] problem under [[Gaussian assumptions]]
3. A [[sufficient statistic]] for updating the state estimate

## Relationship to Other Concepts

The Kalman gain is closely related to several other important concepts:

- [[Joseph form]] of the covariance update
- [[Information filter]] formulation
- [[Extended Kalman filter]] linearization
- [[Unscented Kalman filter]] sigma point propagation

## Computational Considerations

Practical implementation requires attention to:

1. **Numerical Stability**: Using [[matrix factorization]] methods (e.g., [[Cholesky decomposition]]) for robust computation
2. **Computational Efficiency**: Exploiting matrix structure and sparsity patterns
3. **Conditioning**: Monitoring the [[condition number]] of (HPH^T + R) to avoid numerical issues
