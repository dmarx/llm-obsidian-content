danger area crossing


**ASSISTANT**

**Danger area crossing** refers to the tactical movement of military units through exposed or open areas where there is limited cover and concealment, making them vulnerable to enemy observation and fire. These areas, such as open fields, roads, rivers, or gaps between buildings, pose a significant risk, and specialized techniques are used to minimize exposure while maintaining the unit's ability to respond to threats.

The goal during a danger area crossing is to move the unit across the exposed area as quickly and safely as possible, while maintaining security and the ability to react to enemy contact.

### Types of Danger Areas

1. **Linear Danger Areas**:
   - **Examples**: Roads, paths, trails, rivers, or railways.
   - These are long, narrow areas that the unit needs to cross perpendicularly. Linear danger areas are particularly hazardous because they offer extended lines of sight to the enemy and provide minimal natural cover.

2. **Open Danger Areas**:
   - **Examples**: Open fields, parking lots, large clearings.
   - Open danger areas expose the unit to a wide range of threats from multiple directions. They are characterized by a lack of natural cover and require careful planning and speed to cross.

3. **Urban Danger Areas**:
   - **Examples**: Streets, alleys, plazas, and gaps between buildings.
   - In urban environments, crossing streets or open areas between buildings poses risks, especially from enemy forces concealed in windows, rooftops, or behind cover.

4. **Intersection Danger Areas**:
   - **Examples**: Road junctions, trail intersections.
   - These areas provide multiple angles from which the enemy could attack and require extra caution due to the possibility of ambushes.

### Steps for Danger Area Crossing

The specific procedures for crossing a danger area depend on the size of the unit, the size of the danger area, the tactical situation, and the terrain. However, some general principles apply:

1. **Identify the Danger Area**:
   - Before reaching the danger area, the leader identifies the crossing point and assesses potential threats (such as ambushes or enemy overwatch) and the terrain (cover and concealment available on the far side).

2. **Prepare for Crossing**:
   - The unit halts before entering the danger area, and the leader devises a plan for crossing. This may involve splitting the unit into smaller groups, deciding on the method of crossing, and designating **overwatch elements** to provide covering fire.

3. **Establish Overwatch**:
   - At least one element of the unit provides **overwatch** from a concealed position. The overwatch team scans for enemy forces and is ready to engage any threats that appear during the crossing. Overwatch is particularly important in areas where enemy contact is expected or possible.

4. **Crossing the Danger Area**:
   - The crossing element moves as quickly as possible through the exposed area. Several movement techniques can be employed, depending on the situation:
     - **Bounding overwatch**: One team bounds across the danger area while the other provides overwatch. The bounding team moves in quick bursts and then takes cover, alternating with the overwatch team.
     - **Rushing**: The entire unit moves rapidly across the danger area at once, minimizing the time spent in the open.
     - **Successive bounding**: The unit moves in smaller groups, one after another, to reduce the number of soldiers exposed at a time while maintaining overwatch.

5. **Re-establish Security**:
   - Once the unit or group reaches the far side, it immediately establishes **360-degree security**. This involves spreading out, taking cover, and scanning for enemy threats from all directions.
   - The overwatch element then moves across the danger area, following the same process.

6. **Continue Movement**:
   - Once the entire unit has crossed the danger area and established security, they reorganize and continue their movement toward the next objective.

### Danger Area Crossing Techniques

#### 1. **Bounding Overwatch**
**Bounding overwatch** is the safest but slowest technique used to cross danger areas. It involves one team providing covering fire while the other moves (or "bounds") across the danger area in short bursts. After reaching a new position of cover, the teams switch roles.

- **Steps**:
  - The **overwatch team** scans the area and provides cover for the bounding team.
  - The **bounding team** moves swiftly to a position of cover within or beyond the danger area.
  - Once the bounding team reaches cover, they take up overwatch, and the previous overwatch team bounds forward.

- **Best Used For**: High-threat environments, narrow or linear danger areas, situations where enemy contact is expected.
  
- **Advantages**:
  - Maximizes security, as one team is always ready to engage the enemy.
  
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Slow and time-consuming, which could be a problem in time-sensitive operations.

#### 2. **Successive Bounding**
**Successive bounding** is a variant of [[bounding overwatch]] where each team bounds forward to a position slightly ahead or level with the overwatch team, rather than leapfrogging past them. This method is slower but keeps both teams closer together.

- **Steps**:
  - The **bounding team** moves forward a short distance and takes cover.
  - The **overwatch team** moves up to a position level with or slightly ahead of the bounding team, alternating movements.

- **Best Used For**: Situations where speed is important but some level of security is still required.

- **Advantages**:
  - Keeps the unit more cohesive, reducing the chance of being separated.

- **Disadvantages**:
  - Slightly faster than traditional [[bounding overwatch]], but still slow.

#### 3. **Rushing**
**Rushing** involves the entire unit quickly moving across the danger area in one fast, continuous movement. This method is used when speed is more critical than security, typically in environments where enemy contact is possible but not highly likely.

- **Steps**:
  - The entire unit sprints across the danger area at once, moving quickly from one covered position to another.
  - Once across, the unit immediately establishes security on the far side.

- **Best Used For**: Situations where speed is essential, such as large open fields or roads where there is little available cover and concealment.
  
- **Advantages**:
  - Fastest method for crossing a danger area, minimizing time spent in the open.

- **Disadvantages**:
  - Offers minimal protection. If ambushed, the entire unit is exposed at once.

### Special Considerations for Danger Area Crossings

1. **Terrain and Weather**:
   - Terrain features (hills, rivers, roads) and weather conditions (fog, rain, or darkness) can affect the visibility and cover available during danger area crossings. Units must adapt their crossing technique based on these factors.
   - For example, heavy rain or fog may provide **natural concealment**, allowing units to cross danger areas with less risk of being detected.

2. **Enemy Presence**:
   - If **enemy forces** are actively engaged or nearby, a more deliberate and secure crossing method, such as **[[bounding overwatch]]**, is essential. In high-threat areas, **smoke grenades** or **distracting fire** may be used to obscure the unit’s movement and limit enemy observation.

3. **Urban Environment Crossings**:
   - In urban settings, danger area crossings often involve streets, alleys, or open spaces between buildings. The risk of being ambushed from **rooftops** or **windows** is high, so **[[bounding overwatch]]** is frequently used.
   - **Clearing intersections** before crossing, using **observation posts** (OPs) to monitor rooftops, and employing **snipers** to provide cover are key tactics for safely crossing urban danger areas.

4. **Crossing Roads or Trails**:
   - When crossing linear danger areas like roads or trails, units must cross quickly and perpendicularly to minimize exposure. Teams typically cross in **small groups** while others provide **covering fire** from both sides of the road.

### Example: Danger Area Crossing Procedure

A platoon is advancing through forested terrain and comes across a **dirt road** (linear danger area) that it must cross. Here's how the unit would proceed:

1. **Identify the Danger Area**:
   - The platoon leader halts the unit before the road and identifies it as a danger area. They analyze the road’s width, visibility from both sides, and potential enemy observation points.

2. **Establish Overwatch**:
   - The platoon splits into two elements. One squad takes up **overwatch positions** on either side of the road, covering the far side to watch for enemy forces.

3. **Cross the Road**:
   - The first bounding element (another squad) crosses the road quickly, moving in **small groups** (2-3 soldiers at a time) to avoid presenting a large target. Each group crosses the road at a **perpendicular angle**, staying low and moving quickly.
   - Once across, the first element establishes security on the far side, scanning for threats.

4. **Move the Overwatch Element**:
   - After the first element is in place, the overwatch squad bounds across the road in the same manner, covered by the element now positioned on the far side.
   - Both elements maintain security after crossing.

5. **Reorganize and Continue**:
   - Once all squads have crossed, the platoon reorganizes, checks for stragglers, and resumes the mission.

### Conclusion

**Danger area crossing** is a critical tactical movement technique used by military units to navigate exposed areas where they are vulnerable to enemy fire. Whether crossing a road, open field, or urban street, units must carefully assess the threat level
