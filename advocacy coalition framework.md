Advocacy Coalition Framework


**ASSISTANT**

### Advocacy Coalition Framework

The **Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF)** is a comprehensive theory of policy change developed by [[Paul Sabatier]] and [[Hank Jenkins-Smith]] in the late 1980s. It emphasizes the role of coalitions of actors from various institutions who share a set of beliefs and collaborate over extended periods to influence policy outcomes.

#### Key Components of ACF

1. **Policy Subsystems**: The primary unit of analysis in ACF, a policy subsystem consists of actors from different institutions (e.g., government agencies, interest groups, research organizations) who are concerned with a specific policy issue or domain.

2. **Advocacy Coalitions**: Within each policy subsystem, actors form coalitions based on shared beliefs and policy objectives. These coalitions work together to influence policy processes and outcomes.

3. **Belief Systems**: The core of the ACF, belief systems are organized into three levels:
   - **Deep Core Beliefs**: Fundamental, normative values and ontological assumptions about human nature and societal organization. These beliefs are highly resistant to change.
   - **Policy Core Beliefs**: Normative and empirical beliefs that span multiple policy subsystems. These beliefs are more flexible than deep core beliefs but still relatively stable over time.
   - **Secondary Aspects**: Beliefs about specific policy preferences and the means to achieve them within a particular policy subsystem. These are the most susceptible to change in response to new information and experiences.

4. **Policy-Oriented Learning**: The process by which coalitions learn and adapt their strategies based on new information and experiences. This learning can lead to changes in secondary aspects but less frequently in core beliefs.

5. **External System Events**: Changes in external factors such as socioeconomic conditions, public opinion, or political leadership that can impact the policy subsystem and influence the dynamics between coalitions.

6. **Internal Shocks**: Significant events within the policy subsystem (e.g., crises, scandals) that can challenge existing beliefs and prompt policy change.

#### Dynamics of Policy Change

ACF posits that policy change occurs through the interaction of advocacy coalitions within a policy subsystem. The framework outlines several pathways for policy change:

1. **Policy-Oriented Learning**: Coalitions adapt their strategies and preferences based on new knowledge and experiences. This can lead to gradual changes in secondary aspects and occasionally in policy core beliefs.

2. **External System Events**: Changes in the broader political, social, or economic environment can alter the balance of power between coalitions and open windows of opportunity for policy change.

3. **Negotiation and Compromise**: Coalitions may engage in bargaining and compromise to achieve incremental policy changes, particularly when they cannot achieve their goals unilaterally.

4. **Internal Shocks**: Unexpected events within the policy subsystem can disrupt the status quo, leading to reassessments of existing policies and potentially significant changes.

#### Mathematical and Theoretical Models

ACF can be analyzed using various mathematical and theoretical models to understand the dynamics of policy change.

**Network Analysis**:
- **Adjacency Matrix**: Represents the relationships between actors within a coalition. If actor $i$ is connected to actor $j$, the matrix entry $a_{ij}$ is 1; otherwise, it is 0.

  $$
  A = \begin{bmatrix}
  0 & 1 & 0 \\
  1 & 0 & 1 \\
  0 & 1 & 0
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$

**Agent-Based Modeling (ABM)**:
- Simulates the actions and interactions of agents (actors) within a policy subsystem. Each agent follows rules based on their belief systems and engages with other agents to achieve their policy objectives.

  $$
  A_i(t+1) = f(A_i(t), \sum_{j \in N(i)} w_{ij} A_j(t))
  $$

  where $A_i(t)$ is the state of agent $i$ at time $t$, $N(i)$ is the set of neighbors of agent $i$ in the network, and $w_{ij}$ represents the influence weight from agent $j$ to agent $i$.

**Dynamic Systems Modeling**:
- Uses differential equations to model the feedback loops and time-dependent behaviors of policy subsystems.

  $$
  \frac{dB(t)}{dt} = g(B(t), E(t), S(t))
  $$

  where $B(t)$ represents the belief system at time $t$, $E(t)$ is the influence of external system events, and $S(t)$ stands for secondary aspects and policy core beliefs.

#### Practical Implications

Understanding the ACF is essential for:

1. **Policymakers**: To identify the key coalitions and their belief systems, enabling more effective negotiation and compromise in policy development.
2. **Advocacy Groups**: To strategically align with like-minded coalitions and leverage shared beliefs to influence policy outcomes.
3. **Researchers**: To analyze the dynamics of policy change and the impact of external events and policy-oriented learning on policy subsystems.
4. **Public Administrators**: To facilitate collaboration and communication between different coalitions, ensuring more inclusive and comprehensive policy processes.

#### Challenges in Applying ACF

1. **Complexity**: The intricate relationships and interactions within policy subsystems can make it challenging to identify and analyze all relevant actors and coalitions.
2. **Data Limitations**: Accurate and comprehensive data on actors' beliefs, interactions, and influence can be difficult to obtain.
3. **Dynamic Nature**: Policy subsystems and coalitions are constantly evolving, requiring ongoing analysis and adaptation.

#### Conclusion

The Advocacy Coalition Framework provides a robust theoretical foundation for understanding the complex processes of policy change. By focusing on the interactions and belief systems of coalitions within policy subsystems, ACF offers valuable insights into the dynamics of policy development, implementation, and modification. This framework is essential for [[policymakers]], advocacy groups, researchers, and public administrators seeking to navigate and influence the policy landscape effectively.
