title: trust systems in ingress enhancing collaboration and security
---

**USER**

I was a member of one of the tow teams, I think mine was "enlightenment" and the team color was green. in the game lore, I think my team was sorta like the empire in star wars. the opposing team was called the "resistance" and their color was blue. I played in DC where the game was taken very seriously, and there was a leadership structure within the local enlightened community that had evolved naturally. game mechanics promote international, physical in-person communication and collaboration. this includes trading in-game gear through in-person interactions. to facilitate these trades over long distances (long chains) of resource sharing for major events/campaigns, the respective local communities naturally banded together into a super-organization. As it grew and evolved, cross-team espionage became increasingly important to the meta, and both teams began implementing sophisticated counter espionage strategies. one component of this was a trust system supported by a website i think, or maybe embedded in a communication app, that leveraged an in-game mechanism to permit people to "vouch" for each other, but conditional on having met each other in person (based on in-app proximity I think). I was hoping you maybe knew something about this system and could discuss it, or if not aware of this specific system maybe theorize how it probably works, or describe systems like this.

### Trust Systems in Ingress: Enhancing Collaboration and Security

In the augmented reality game Ingress, players join one of two factions: the Enlightened (green team) or the Resistance (blue team). Given the competitive and collaborative nature of Ingress, particularly in areas like Washington D.C. where gameplay is taken very seriously, sophisticated organizational structures and security measures naturally evolve. This includes the development of trust systems that facilitate secure collaboration and resource sharing among players, especially for handling in-game items and strategic information.

#### Understanding the Trust System in Ingress

Based on your description, the trust system you're referring to likely operates as a crucial part of both operational security (OpSec) and logistics coordination. Here’s how such a system might be theoretically conceptualized and implemented:

**Core Features:**
1. **Vouching Mechanism**: Players can "vouch" for each other's trustworthiness. This vouching is contingent on having met in person, which is verified through proximity detection features in the game app itself. This requirement ensures a physical verification of identity, adding a layer of security and authenticity.
   
2. **Web-Based or App-Embedded Platform**: The system could be integrated into a third-party website or embedded within a communication app commonly used by players. This platform would track and display vouched statuses, potentially including levels of trust based on the number and quality of vouches a player has received.

3. **Conditional Access**: Access to certain information or resources could be gated based on a player’s vouch level. For example, only players who have been vouched for by multiple trusted members may access high-value operational plans or participate in critical resource chains.

**Mathematical Model of Trust:**
$$ T(u) = \sum_{v \in V(u)} w_v \cdot f(\text{proximity}(u, v), \text{interactions}(u, v)) $$
Where:
- $T(u)$ is the trust score of user $u$.
- $V(u)$ is the set of users who have vouched for $u$.
- $w_v$ is the weight assigned to the voucher $v$, potentially based on their own trust score.
- $f$ is a function that factors in both the proximity and the number/nature of past interactions between $u$ and $v$.

#### Security Implications and Enhancements

In such a competitive and strategic game environment, the trust system not only facilitates collaboration but also becomes a target for counter-espionage activities. Here are some security enhancements that might be considered:

1. **Multi-Factor Vouching**: Incorporating multiple factors into the vouching process, such as duration of acquaintance, number of shared events, or mutual vouchers, to complicate infiltration efforts by opposing faction members.
   
2. **Anomaly Detection**: Implementing algorithms to detect unusual patterns in vouching, which could indicate espionage attempts or the exploitation of the system.
   
3. **Privacy Protection**: Ensuring that the details of the vouching interactions are encrypted and that user data is protected to prevent misuse or interception by hostile entities.

4. **Regular Audits**: Periodically reviewing vouch records and trust scores to identify and mitigate any integrity issues within the system.

#### Conclusion

The development of a trust system within the Ingress community illustrates an innovative approach to managing security and collaboration in a real-time, location-based competitive environment. Such a system not only enhances gameplay but also provides a fascinating case study of social dynamics and trust management in digital communities. This model offers lessons and strategies that could be applicable in other fields requiring secure, efficient, and reliable collaboration across large and diverse groups.
