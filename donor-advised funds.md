Donor-Advised Funds


**ASSISTANT**

A Donor-Advised Fund (DAF) is a philanthropic vehicle that allows donors to make a charitable contribution, receive an immediate tax deduction, and then recommend grants from the fund to various charitable organizations over time. DAFs offer flexibility, simplicity, and significant tax advantages, making them a popular choice for strategic philanthropy. Here are the key aspects of DAFs:

### 1. Structure and Operation

#### Establishing a DAF
- **Sponsoring Organization:** DAFs are administered by public charities, often affiliated with financial institutions, community foundations, or national charities. Examples include Fidelity Charitable, Schwab Charitable, and Vanguard Charitable.
- **Account Setup:** Donors open a DAF account with a sponsoring organization and contribute cash, securities, or other assets to the fund.

#### Contributions
- **Immediate Tax Deduction:** Donors receive an immediate tax deduction for the fair market value of the contribution in the year it is made, subject to IRS limits on charitable contributions.
- **Asset Types:** Contributions can include cash, publicly traded securities, privately held business interests, real estate, and other assets.

#### Investment Growth
- **Investment Options:** The contributed assets are invested in various investment options provided by the sponsoring organization, allowing the fund to potentially grow tax-free.
- **Control Over Investments:** Donors can recommend how the assets are invested, although the final decision rests with the sponsoring organization.

### 2. Grantmaking

#### Recommending Grants
- **Flexibility in Timing:** Donors can recommend grants to IRS-qualified public charities from their DAF at any time, allowing for strategic timing of donations.
- **Grant Approval:** The sponsoring organization must approve the grant recommendations to ensure they meet regulatory requirements and align with the donorâ€™s philanthropic goals.

#### Anonymity and Recognition
- **Donor Anonymity:** Donors can choose to make grants anonymously or receive recognition for their contributions, depending on their preferences.

### 3. Tax Benefits

#### Tax Deduction Limits
- **Cash Contributions:** Deductions are typically limited to 60% of the donor's adjusted gross income (AGI) for cash contributions.
- **Non-Cash Contributions:** For appreciated securities and other assets, the deduction is generally limited to 30% of AGI.

#### Capital Gains Tax Avoidance
- **Appreciated Assets:** Donating appreciated securities or other assets directly to a DAF allows the donor to avoid paying capital gains tax on the appreciation. The full fair market value of the asset is deductible, maximizing the tax benefit.

### 4. Strategic Considerations

#### Bunching Donations
- **Maximizing Deductions:** Donors can "bunch" several years' worth of charitable contributions into a single year to exceed the standard deduction threshold, thereby maximizing their itemized deductions in that year.

#### Estate Planning
- **Legacy Planning:** DAFs can be used as part of an estate plan to ensure continued charitable giving after the donor's death. Donors can name successors or charitable beneficiaries to manage the DAF in the future.

#### Administrative Ease
- **Simplified Giving:** DAFs simplify record-keeping and administration for donors by consolidating multiple charitable donations into a single account.

### 5. Examples and Use Cases

#### High-Income Year Strategy
An individual with a significantly high income in a particular year can contribute to a DAF to reduce their taxable income. For example, an executive receiving a large bonus might contribute a portion of it to a DAF, receiving an immediate tax deduction and spreading the grants over several years.

#### Sale of Appreciated Assets
A tech entrepreneur with a large holding of appreciated stock can donate shares to a DAF, avoiding capital gains tax and receiving a deduction for the fair market value of the stock. The entrepreneur can then recommend grants from the DAF to support various charities.

### 6. Regulatory and Compliance Considerations

#### IRS Regulations
- **Qualified Charities:** Grants must be made to IRS-qualified public charities to maintain the tax-advantaged status of the DAF.
- **No Personal Benefit:** Donors cannot receive any personal benefit from the grants made from the DAF (e.g., cannot pay for event tickets or memberships).

#### Reporting Requirements
- **Form 8283:** For non-cash contributions exceeding $500, donors must file IRS Form 8283.
- **Annual Reporting:** Sponsoring organizations typically handle all necessary reporting and compliance requirements, including providing donors with annual statements.

### Conclusion

Donor-Advised Funds offer a flexible, efficient, and tax-advantaged way to manage charitable giving. By allowing immediate tax deductions, facilitating the donation of appreciated assets, and providing ongoing grant-making flexibility, DAFs enable donors to maximize their philanthropic impact while enjoying significant tax benefits. They are particularly useful for strategic tax planning, estate planning, and simplifying the administration of charitable contributions.
