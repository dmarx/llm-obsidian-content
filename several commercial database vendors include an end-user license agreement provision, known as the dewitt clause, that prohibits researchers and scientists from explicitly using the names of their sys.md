**USER**

> Several commercial database vendors include an end-user license agreement provision, known as the DeWitt Clause, that prohibits researchers and scientists from explicitly using the names of their systems in academic papers.[4][5]

> In essence, a DeWitt Clause forbids the publication of database benchmarks that the database vendor has not sanctioned. The original DeWitt Clause was established by Oracle at the behest of Larry Ellison. Ellison was displeased with a benchmark study done by David DeWitt in 1982, then an assistant professor, using his Wisconsin Benchmark program, which showed that Oracle's system had poor performance.[6]


**ASSISTANT**

The term "DeWitt Clause" also refers to a specific provision included in the end-user license agreements (EULAs) of several commercial database vendors. This clause prohibits researchers and scientists from explicitly using the names of the vendors' database systems in academic papers and publications without prior approval. Here’s an in-depth look at the DeWitt Clause in this context:

## Origin and Background

### The Incident with Oracle

The original DeWitt Clause was established by Oracle, driven by dissatisfaction from Larry Ellison, Oracle's co-founder and then CEO. In 1982, David DeWitt, who was an assistant professor at the time, conducted a benchmark study using the [[Wisconsin Database Benchmark]]. This study highlighted poor performance of Oracle's database system compared to its competitors. Unhappy with these results, Ellison prompted the inclusion of a clause in Oracle's EULA that effectively barred the publication of any benchmark results not sanctioned by Oracle.

### Evolution and Adoption

Following Oracle's lead, other commercial database vendors adopted similar clauses in their EULAs. These clauses have come to be collectively known as the "DeWitt Clause," named after David DeWitt due to his involvement in the benchmark study that triggered their creation.

## The Clause

### Content and Restrictions

The DeWitt Clause typically includes provisions such as:

- **Prohibition of Unapproved Benchmarks**: Researchers cannot publish benchmark results involving the vendor’s database system without obtaining prior written consent from the vendor.
- **Usage Restrictions**: The database system cannot be used for benchmark testing without the vendor’s approval.
- **Legal Consequences**: Violations of this clause may result in legal action from the vendor, including penalties and revocation of the software license.

### Purpose

The main purposes of the DeWitt Clause are:

- **Control of Information**: Allow vendors to control how performance data about their systems is disseminated.
- **Protection of Reputation**: Prevent potentially unfavorable or biased benchmark results from damaging the vendor’s reputation.
- **Ensuring Fairness**: Ensure that any benchmarks published are conducted in a fair and controlled environment, potentially approved by the vendor.

## Criticism and Impact

### Academic Freedom and Transparency

The DeWitt Clause has been widely criticized for its impact on academic freedom and the transparency of benchmarking practices. Key points of criticism include:

- **Suppression of Research**: By restricting the publication of benchmark results, the clause can suppress important research findings and hinder scientific progress.
- **Bias and Lack of Transparency**: The requirement for vendor approval can introduce bias, as vendors may only approve benchmarks that show their products in a favorable light.
- **Reduction in Comparative Studies**: The clause makes it difficult for researchers to conduct and publish comparative studies across different database systems, limiting the availability of independent performance evaluations.

### Response from the Research Community

In response to the limitations imposed by the DeWitt Clause, the research community has sought ways to conduct meaningful and transparent benchmarking:

- **Open Source Benchmarks**: Researchers often use open-source database systems that do not impose such restrictions, allowing for more open and unbiased benchmarking.
- **Anonymous Benchmarks**: Some studies anonymize the names of the database systems to circumvent the clause while still providing useful comparative data.
- **Advocacy for Change**: There has been ongoing advocacy within the academic and research community to eliminate or reduce the use of such restrictive clauses to promote better scientific inquiry and transparency.

## Conclusion

The DeWitt Clause, originally prompted by a benchmark study conducted by David DeWitt, represents a significant point of contention between database vendors and the research community. While it aims to protect vendors from potentially biased or unfair benchmarking practices, it also raises important issues regarding academic freedom, transparency, and the integrity of scientific research.
