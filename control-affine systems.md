### Control-Affine Systems

Control-affine systems are a class of dynamical systems in control theory where the control inputs appear linearly. These systems are described by differential equations where the state dynamics are affine in the control variables.

### Mathematical Formulation

A control-affine system in the state-space form can be written as:
$$
\dot{x}(t) = f(x(t)) + \sum_{i=1}^m g_i(x(t)) u_i(t),
$$
where:
- \( x(t) \in \mathbb{R}^n \) is the state vector.
- \( u(t) = (u_1(t), u_2(t), \ldots, u_m(t)) \in \mathbb{R}^m \) is the control input vector.
- \( f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n \) is a smooth vector field representing the drift dynamics.
- \( g_i: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n \) for \( i = 1, \ldots, m \) are smooth vector fields representing the influence of each control input.

### Properties

1. **Linearity in Controls**: The control inputs \( u_i(t) \) appear linearly in the system equations.
2. **Nonlinearity in States**: The functions \( f(x) \) and \( g_i(x) \) can be nonlinear with respect to the state variables \( x \).
3. **Affine Structure**: The system is affine in the controls, meaning that it consists of a linear combination of the control inputs plus a drift term \( f(x) \).

### Examples

#### Linear Control Systems

A special case of control-affine systems where \( f(x) = Ax \) and \( g_i(x) = B_i \) are linear functions:
$$
\dot{x}(t) = Ax(t) + \sum_{i=1}^m B_i u_i(t).
$$

#### Nonlinear Control Systems

Consider a simple [[nonlinear control]]-affine system:
$$
\dot{x}_1 = x_2, \quad \dot{x}_2 = -x_1 + u.
$$
Here, \( f(x) = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ -x_1 \end{pmatrix} \) and \( g(x) = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \).

### Control Objectives

1. **Stabilization**: Design a control law \( u(t) \) such that the system state \( x(t) \) converges to a desired equilibrium point \( x^* \).
2. **Tracking**: Design \( u(t) \) such that the state \( x(t) \) follows a desired trajectory \( x_d(t) \).
3. **Optimal Control**: Find \( u(t) \) that minimizes a given cost functional, typically of the form:
   $$
   J(u) = \int_0^T L(x(t), u(t)) \, dt + \Phi(x(T)),
   $$
   where \( L \) is the running cost and \( \Phi \) is the terminal cost.

### Control Design Methods

#### Feedback Linearization

For certain control-affine systems, it is possible to design a nonlinear feedback control law that transforms the system into a linear one, which can then be controlled using linear control techniques.

#### Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR)

For systems that can be approximated as linear around an operating point, the LQR approach provides an optimal control law that minimizes a quadratic cost function.

#### Sliding Mode Control

A robust control method that drives the system state to a sliding surface and then maintains it on this surface despite uncertainties and disturbances.

### Differential Inclusions

Control-affine systems can also be described using [[differential inclusions]], particularly when the control inputs are subject to constraints:
$$
\dot{x}(t) \in f(x(t)) + \sum_{i=1}^m g_i(x(t)) U_i,
$$
where \( U_i \) are sets representing the allowable values of the control inputs \( u_i(t) \).

### Example: Simple Pendulum with Control

Consider a pendulum with an external control torque \( u(t) \):
$$
\ddot{\theta} + \frac{g}{L} \sin(\theta) = \frac{u(t)}{mL^2}.
$$
Rewriting this as a first-order system:
$$
\begin{cases}
\dot{\theta} = \omega, \\
\dot{\omega} = -\frac{g}{L} \sin(\theta) + \frac{u(t)}{mL^2}.
\end{cases}
$$
Here, the state vector is \( x = (\theta, \omega) \), and the system is control-affine with \( f(x) = \begin{pmatrix} \omega \\ -\frac{g}{L} \sin(\theta) \end{pmatrix} \) and \( g(x) = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ \frac{1}{mL^2} \end{pmatrix} \).

### Conclusion

Control-affine systems are foundational in control theory due to their linearity in control inputs and the flexibility to model nonlinear state dynamics. They allow for a wide range of control design techniques and applications, from stabilization and tracking to optimal control.
