# Chebyshev Spectral Methods

## Definition

Chebyshev [[spectral methods]] are numerical techniques used to solve differential equations by expanding the solution in terms of Chebyshev polynomials. These methods are particularly effective for problems with non-periodic boundary conditions and are known for their high accuracy and efficiency.

## Key Concepts

### Chebyshev Polynomials

Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind, \( T_n(x) \), are defined on the interval \([-1, 1]\) and are given by:

$$
T_n(x) = \cos(n \arccos(x))
$$

These polynomials have several important properties:
- **Orthogonality**: They are orthogonal with respect to the weight function \( w(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}} \).
- **Roots**: The roots of \( T_n(x) \) are \( x_k = \cos\left(\frac{\pi (k + 0.5)}{n}\right) \) for \( k = 0, 1, \ldots, n-1 \).

### Chebyshev Series Expansion

A function \( u(x) \) defined on the interval \([-1, 1]\) can be approximated by a Chebyshev series:

$$
u(x) \approx \sum_{n=0}^{N} a_n T_n(x)
$$

where \( a_n \) are the Chebyshev coefficients given by:

$$
a_n = \frac{2}{N} \sum_{k=0}^{N} u(x_k) T_n(x_k) w_k
$$

Here, \( x_k \) are the Chebyshev-Gauss-Lobatto nodes and \( w_k \) are the weights of the Gauss-Chebyshev quadrature.

### Gauss-Chebyshev Quadrature

Gauss-Chebyshev quadrature is used to compute the Chebyshev coefficients:

$$
a_n = \frac{2}{N} \sum_{k=0}^{N} u(x_k) T_n(x_k)
$$

where \( x_k = \cos\left(\frac{\pi k}{N}\right) \) for \( k = 0, 1, \ldots, N \).

### Differentiation

Differentiation of the Chebyshev series can be done by differentiating the basis functions term by term. The derivatives of Chebyshev polynomials can be expressed in terms of Chebyshev polynomials themselves.

### Chebyshev Differentiation Matrix

To approximate the derivatives of a function at the Chebyshev nodes, a differentiation matrix \( D \) is used. For first derivatives, the entries of the Chebyshev differentiation matrix are given by:

$$
D_{ij} = \begin{cases}
\frac{2N^2 + 1}{6}, & i = j = 0 \\
-\frac{2N^2 + 1}{6}, & i = j = N \\
-\frac{x_j}{2(1-x_j^2)}, & i = j \neq 0, N \\
\frac{c_i}{c_j} \frac{(-1)^{i+j}}{x_i - x_j}, & i \neq j
\end{cases}
$$

where \( c_i = 2 \) if \( i = 0 \) or \( i = N \), otherwise \( c_i = 1 \).

## Implementation Steps

1. **Discretize the Domain**: Map the problem domain to the interval \([-1, 1]\) and choose Chebyshev-Gauss-Lobatto nodes \( x_k = \cos\left(\frac{\pi k}{N}\right) \).

2. **Expand the Function**: Compute the Chebyshev coefficients using Gauss-Chebyshev quadrature.

3. **Construct Differentiation Matrix**: Construct the Chebyshev differentiation matrix \( D \).

4. **Solve the Differential Equation**: Use the differentiation matrix to approximate derivatives and solve the resulting system of algebraic equations for the coefficients.

## Example: Solving the Poisson Equation

Consider solving the Poisson equation \( -u''(x) = f(x) \) on the interval \([-1, 1]\) with Dirichlet boundary conditions \( u(-1) = u(1) = 0 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Discretize the Domain**: Choose \( N \) Chebyshev-Gauss-Lobatto nodes \( x_k = \cos\left(\frac{\pi k}{N}\right) \).

2. **Initial Condition**: Define the source term \( f(x) \) at the Chebyshev nodes.

3. **Compute Chebyshev Coefficients**: Compute the Chebyshev coefficients \( a_n \) for the source term \( f(x) \).

4. **Construct Differentiation Matrix**: Construct the Chebyshev differentiation matrix \( D \).

5. **Formulate System of Equations**: Use the differentiation matrix to approximate the second derivative and formulate the system of equations:

   $$ \sum_{j=0}^{N} D_{ij} D_{jk} u(x_k) = -f(x_i), \quad i, k = 1, \ldots, N-1 $$

6. **Apply Boundary Conditions**: Incorporate the Dirichlet boundary conditions \( u(-1) = u(1) = 0 \).

7. **Solve the System**: Solve the resulting linear system for the unknown values of \( u(x_k) \).

### Pseudocode

```python
import numpy as np
import scipy.linalg as la

# Parameters
N = 32  # Number of Chebyshev nodes
L = 2 * np.pi  # Length of the domain
alpha = 0.01  # Diffusivity
dt = 0.01  # Time step
T = 1.0  # Total simulation time

# Chebyshev-Gauss-Lobatto nodes
x = np.cos(np.pi * np.arange(N + 1) / N)

# Differentiation matrix
D = np.zeros((N + 1, N + 1))
for i in range(N + 1):
    for j in range(N + 1):
        if i != j:
            D[i, j] = (-1)**(i + j) / (x[i] - x[j])
D[0, 0] = (2 * N**2 + 1) / 6
D[N, N] = -D[0, 0]
for i in range(1, N):
    D[i, i] = -x[i] / (2 * (1 - x[i]**2))

# Initial condition
u = np.sin(np.pi * x)

# Time integration loop
t = 0
while t < T:
    # Compute first and second derivatives
    u_x = np.dot(D, u)
    u_xx = np.dot(D, u_x)

    # Update u using explicit Euler method
    u = u + dt * alpha * u_xx

    # Update time
    t += dt

# Final result
print(u)
```
