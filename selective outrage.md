**Selective Outrage**

### Definition
Selective outrage refers to the phenomenon where an individual or group expresses intense anger or disapproval over specific issues while ignoring or minimizing others that are equally or more significant. This can be observed in various contexts, such as politics, social justice, and media coverage, where the focus on certain topics is disproportionately amplified compared to others.

### Mechanisms and Causes
Selective outrage often arises from cognitive biases, social influences, and psychological factors. Key mechanisms include:

1. **Confirmation Bias**: People tend to pay more attention to information that confirms their existing beliefs and ignore information that contradicts them.
2. **Ingroup Bias**: Individuals are more likely to express outrage over issues affecting their own group while dismissing similar issues affecting outgroups.
3. **Media Influence**: The media can shape public perception by highlighting certain events while downplaying others, leading to a skewed sense of importance.
4. **Moral Licensing**: After taking a stand on one issue, individuals might feel morally licensed to ignore other issues, believing they have already fulfilled their ethical responsibilities.

### Mathematical Formalization

Selective outrage can be modeled using concepts from probability and statistics, particularly in the context of decision theory and behavioral economics.

Let $A$ and $B$ be two events of interest where $P(A)$ and $P(B)$ denote the probability of these events occurring, and $O(A)$ and $O(B)$ represent the level of outrage expressed by an individual or group over these events.

A model for selective outrage can be formulated as:
$$
O(A) \neq O(B) \quad \text{even if} \quad P(A) \approx P(B) \quad \text{or} \quad \text{Impact}(A) \approx \text{Impact}(B)
$$

Here, $O(A)$ and $O(B)$ can be influenced by:
- **Bias Weights** $\beta_i$: Factors such as personal relevance, media coverage, and group identity.
- **Event Impact** $\mathcal{I}(A)$ and $\mathcal{I}(B)$: The objective impact or significance of events $A$ and $B$.

### Bias Adjustment Model
A bias-adjusted outrage model could be represented as:
$$
O(A) = \alpha \mathcal{I}(A) + \sum_{i=1}^n \beta_i \mathcal{B}_i(A)
$$
where:
- $\alpha$ is a scaling factor representing the baseline sensitivity to the event's impact.
- $\beta_i$ are bias weights.
- $\mathcal{B}_i(A)$ are bias factors related to event $A$.

### Example
Consider two incidents of ethical violations:
- **Incident A**: A corporation engages in environmentally harmful practices.
- **Incident B**: A small business owner engages in discriminatory hiring practices.

Even if the objective impact $\mathcal{I}(A) \approx \mathcal{I}(B)$, selective outrage might manifest if the media heavily covers Incident A while barely mentioning Incident B. Thus, the outrage expressed $O(A)$ could be significantly higher than $O(B)$ due to media influence ($\beta_{\text{media}}$).

### Implications and Discussions
Selective outrage has significant implications in social and political discourse:
- It can lead to disproportionate policy responses.
- It may contribute to social divisions by reinforcing ingroup-outgroup dynamics.
- Understanding the mechanisms can help in addressing biases and fostering a more balanced perspective.

In conclusion, selective outrage is a multifaceted phenomenon influenced by cognitive biases, social dynamics, and media portrayal, and its study involves integrating insights from psychology, sociology, and quantitative modeling.
