score matching


**ASSISTANT**

The user wants me to write a technical wiki entry on score matching for their knowledge base. This should be detailed, technical, with mathematical formalisms, and suitable for someone with graduate degrees in applied mathematics, statistics, and philosophy of science. I need to follow the wiki format with double brackets for novel terms, provide deep technical detail, and propose symbolic notation.

Score matching is a method for estimating probability densities without computing the normalization constant. It's based on matching the score function (gradient of log-density) rather than the density itself. This is particularly useful in cases where the normalization constant is intractable.

Key topics to cover:
1. Mathematical foundation - the score function and its properties
2. Score matching objective 
3. Denoising score matching
4. Sliced score matching
5. Applications (generative modeling, sampling)
6. Connection to diffusion models
7. Computational considerations
8. Theoretical properties

I should provide rigorous mathematical treatment and establish comprehensive notation.# Score Matching

[[Score matching]] is a density estimation technique that circumvents the intractable [[normalization constant]] problem by matching [[score functions]] rather than probability densities directly. The method exploits the fundamental insight that the gradient of the log-density (the score function) can be estimated without knowledge of the partition function.

## Mathematical Foundation

### Score Function Definition

For a probability density $p(x)$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$, the [[score function]] is defined as:

$$s(x) = \nabla_x \log p(x) = \frac{\nabla_x p(x)}{p(x)}$$

The score function possesses several remarkable properties that make it amenable to estimation:

1. **Partition function independence**: If $p(x) = \frac{\tilde{p}(x)}{Z}$ where $Z = \int \tilde{p}(x) dx$, then:
   $$s(x) = \nabla_x \log p(x) = \nabla_x \log \tilde{p}(x) - \nabla_x \log Z = \nabla_x \log \tilde{p}(x)$$

2. **Zero boundary behavior**: Under appropriate regularity conditions:
   $$\lim_{\|x\| \to \infty} p(x) s(x) = 0$$

### Fisher Divergence

The [[Fisher divergence]] provides the natural distance measure between score functions:

$$\mathcal{J}[s_\theta, s] = \frac{1}{2} \mathbb{E}_{p(x)}\left[\|s_\theta(x) - s(x)\|^2\right]$$

where $s_\theta(x)$ is a parameterized approximation to the true score $s(x) = \nabla_x \log p(x)$.

Direct minimization of the Fisher divergence requires access to the true score function, which is typically unknown. The key insight of score matching is that this objective can be transformed into a tractable form.

## Score Matching Objective

### Integration by Parts Transformation

The fundamental score matching identity exploits [[integration by parts]] to eliminate dependence on the unknown true score. For the Fisher divergence:

$$\mathcal{J}[s_\theta, s] = \frac{1}{2} \mathbb{E}_{p(x)}\left[\|s_\theta(x)\|^2\right] - \mathbb{E}_{p(x)}\left[s_\theta(x)^T s(x)\right] + \frac{1}{2} \mathbb{E}_{p(x)}\left[\|s(x)\|^2\right]$$

The cross-term can be rewritten using integration by parts. For any component $i$:

$$\mathbb{E}_{p(x)}[s_{\theta,i}(x) s_i(x)] = \mathbb{E}_{p(x)}\left[s_{\theta,i}(x) \frac{\partial \log p(x)}{\partial x_i}\right]$$

$$= \int s_{\theta,i}(x) \frac{\partial p(x)}{\partial x_i} dx = -\int \frac{\partial s_{\theta,i}(x)}{\partial x_i} p(x) dx = -\mathbb{E}_{p(x)}\left[\frac{\partial s_{\theta,i}(x)}{\partial x_i}\right]$$

### Explicit Score Matching Objective

The [[explicit score matching]] objective becomes:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{ESM}}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{p(x)}\left[\frac{1}{2}\|s_\theta(x)\|^2 + \nabla_x \cdot s_\theta(x)\right]$$

where $\nabla_x \cdot s_\theta(x) = \sum_{i=1}^d \frac{\partial s_{\theta,i}(x)}{\partial x_i}$ is the [[divergence]] of the score function.

The empirical estimate given samples $\{x_n\}_{n=1}^N \sim p(x)$ is:

$$\hat{\mathcal{L}}_{\text{ESM}}(\theta) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N \left[\frac{1}{2}\|s_\theta(x_n)\|^2 + \nabla_x \cdot s_\theta(x_n)\right]$$

## Denoising Score Matching

### Noise-Conditional Framework

[[Denoising score matching]] addresses computational challenges in explicit score matching by introducing [[noise perturbation]]. Consider a [[noise-conditional distribution]]:

$$q_\sigma(x|x_0) = \mathcal{N}(x; x_0, \sigma^2 I)$$

where $x_0 \sim p_{\text{data}}(x)$ is a clean data point and $\sigma > 0$ is the noise level.

The [[marginal noisy distribution]] is:

$$q_\sigma(x) = \int p_{\text{data}}(x_0) q_\sigma(x|x_0) dx_0$$

### Denoising Score Matching Objective

The denoising score matching objective matches the score of the marginal noisy distribution:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{DSM}}(\theta; \sigma) = \frac{1}{2} \mathbb{E}_{q_\sigma(x)}\left[\|s_\theta(x, \sigma) - \nabla_x \log q_\sigma(x)\|^2\right]$$

A crucial result shows that this objective can be computed without knowing the marginal score:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{DSM}}(\theta; \sigma) = \frac{1}{2} \mathbb{E}_{p_{\text{data}}(x_0), q_\sigma(x|x_0)}\left[\|s_\theta(x, \sigma) - \nabla_x \log q_\sigma(x|x_0)\|^2\right]$$

For Gaussian noise, $\nabla_x \log q_\sigma(x|x_0) = -\frac{x - x_0}{\sigma^2}$, yielding:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{DSM}}(\theta; \sigma) = \frac{1}{2\sigma^4} \mathbb{E}_{p_{\text{data}}(x_0), \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0,I)}\left[\|\sigma^2 s_\theta(x_0 + \sigma\epsilon, \sigma) + \epsilon\|^2\right]$$

### Multi-Scale Training

To capture features at different scales, we typically train across multiple noise levels:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{DSM}}(\theta) = \sum_{l=1}^L \lambda_l \mathcal{L}_{\text{DSM}}(\theta; \sigma_l)$$

where $\{\sigma_l\}_{l=1}^L$ form a geometric progression and $\{\lambda_l\}_{l=1}^L$ are weighting coefficients.

## Sliced Score Matching

### Random Projection Framework

[[Sliced score matching]] reduces computational complexity by projecting the score matching problem onto random directions. For a random direction $v \sim p_v$ on the unit sphere:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{SSM}}(\theta) = \frac{1}{2} \mathbb{E}_{p(x), p_v}\left[(v^T s_\theta(x) - v^T s(x))^2\right]$$

Using the identity $v^T s(x) = v^T \nabla_x \log p(x)$ and integration by parts:

$$\mathbb{E}_{p(x)}[v^T s_\theta(x) \cdot v^T s(x)] = -\mathbb{E}_{p(x)}[v^T \nabla_x (v^T s_\theta(x))]$$

### Hutchinson Trace Estimator

The [[sliced score matching]] objective becomes:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{SSM}}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{p(x), p_v}\left[\frac{1}{2}(v^T s_\theta(x))^2 + v^T \nabla_x(v^T s_\theta(x))\right]$$

The term $v^T \nabla_x(v^T s_\theta(x)) = v^T H_{s_\theta}(x) v$ involves the [[Hessian]] $H_{s_\theta}(x)$ of the score function. This is efficiently estimated using the [[Hutchinson trace estimator]]:

$$\text{tr}(H) \approx \frac{1}{K} \sum_{k=1}^K v_k^T H v_k$$

where $v_k$ are random vectors with $\mathbb{E}[v_k v_k^T] = I$.

## Symbolic Notation Framework

**Score Function Spaces:**
- $\mathcal{S}$: Space of all score functions on $\mathbb{R}^d$
- $\mathcal{S}_\theta$: Parameterized family of score approximators
- $\mathcal{F}_{\text{Fisher}}$: Fisher information metric on $\mathcal{S}$

**Divergence Measures:**
- $D_{\text{Fisher}}(s_1, s_2) = \frac{1}{2}\mathbb{E}_{p(x)}[\|s_1(x) - s_2(x)\|^2]$
- $D_{\text{Stein}}(s, p) = \mathbb{E}_{p(x)}[s(x)^T \nabla_x \log p(x) + \nabla_x \cdot s(x)]$

**Noise Operators:**
- $T_\sigma: p(x) \mapsto q_\sigma(x) = \int p(x_0) \mathcal{N}(x; x_0, \sigma^2 I) dx_0$
- $\mathcal{N}_\sigma: x_0 \mapsto x_0 + \sigma \epsilon, \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)$

**Projection Operators:**
- $P_v: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}$, $(P_v s)(x) = v^T s(x)$
- $\mathbb{E}_v[\cdot]$: Expectation over random projections

## Theoretical Properties

### Consistency

Under regularity conditions, the score matching estimator is [[Fisher consistent]]:

$$\lim_{N \to \infty} \arg\min_{\theta} \hat{\mathcal{L}}_{\text{SM}}(\theta) = \arg\min_{\theta} \mathcal{J}[s_\theta, s_{\text{true}}]$$

### Convergence Rates

For smooth densities in the [[Sobolev space]] $W^{k,2}(\mathbb{R}^d)$, the convergence rate is:

$$\mathbb{E}[\mathcal{J}[s_{\hat{\theta}}, s_{\text{true}}]] = O(N^{-\frac{2k}{2k+d}})$$

This exhibits the [[curse of dimensionality]] typical in nonparametric estimation.

### Connection to Stein's Method

Score matching is intimately connected to [[Stein's method]]. The [[Stein operator]] for a distribution $p$ is:

$$\mathcal{A}_p h(x) = \nabla_x \log p(x) \cdot h(x) + \nabla_x \cdot h(x)$$

The score matching objective can be written as:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{SM}}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{p(x)}[(\mathcal{A}_p s_\theta)(x)]$$

## Applications in Generative Modeling

### Score-Based Generative Models

[[Score-based generative models]] use learned score functions for sampling via [[Langevin dynamics]]:

$$x_{t+1} = x_t + \epsilon s_\theta(x_t) + \sqrt{2\epsilon} z_t$$

where $z_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)$ and $\epsilon$ is the step size.

### Stochastic Differential Equations

Modern score-based models employ [[stochastic differential equations]] (SDEs). The forward process is:

$$dx = f(x, t) dt + g(t) dw$$

where $w$ is a [[Wiener process]]. The reverse-time SDE is:

$$dx = [f(x, t) - g(t)^2 \nabla_x \log p_t(x)] dt + g(t) d\bar{w}$$

where $p_t(x)$ is the marginal density at time $t$ and $\bar{w}$ is a reverse-time Wiener process.

### Conditional Generation

For conditional generation $p(x|y)$, the score function decomposes as:

$$\nabla_x \log p(x|y) = \nabla_x \log p(x) + \nabla_x \log p(y|x) - \nabla_x \log p(y)$$

This enables [[classifier guidance]] and [[classifier-free guidance]] techniques.

## Computational Implementation

### Neural Network Architecture

Score networks typically employ [[U-Net architectures]] with:
- [[Skip connections]] for multi-scale feature propagation
- [[Positional embeddings]] for noise level conditioning
- [[Attention mechanisms]] for long-range dependencies

### Variance Reduction

Several techniques reduce gradient variance:
- [[Importance sampling]] for noise level selection
- [[Control variates]] using analytical score components
- [[Antithetic sampling]] for paired gradient estimates

### Memory-Efficient Training

For high-dimensional problems:
- [[Gradient checkpointing]] reduces memory requirements
- [[Mixed precision training]] accelerates computation
- [[Distributed training]] scales to large datasets

The framework of score matching continues to evolve, with active research in [[continuous normalizing flows]], [[optimal transport]] connections, and applications to [[inverse problems]] and [[Bayesian inference]].I think this is a comprehensive and technical wiki entry on score matching. I covered:

1. Mathematical foundation with the score function definition and Fisher divergence
2. The key insight of integration by parts that makes score matching tractable
3. Explicit score matching objective
4. Denoising score matching which is practically very important
5. Sliced score matching for computational efficiency
6. Symbolic notation framework as requested
7. Theoretical properties including consistency and convergence rates
8. Connection to Stein's method
9. Applications in generative modeling including modern SDE-based approaches
10. Computational considerations

The mathematical treatment is rigorous and detailed, suitable for someone with graduate degrees in applied mathematics and statistics. I used the wiki-style double brackets for novel terms and provided concrete mathematical formalisms throughout. The notation is comprehensive and should serve as a good reference.

I avoided any conversational elements and wrote it purely as a technical wiki entry as requested.
