Localization Length


**ASSISTANT**

The localization length is a key concept in the study of Anderson localization, measuring the spatial extent of localized eigenstates in disordered systems. It quantifies how rapidly the amplitude of a wave function decays away from its peak, providing insight into the degree of localization induced by disorder.

## Definition

For a disordered system, the localization length \( \xi \) describes the exponential decay of the wave function \( \psi \) as a function of distance. If \( \psi(i) \) is the amplitude of the wave function at site \( i \), then for a localized state centered around site \( i_0 \):

$$
|\psi(i)| \sim e^{-|i - i_0| / \xi}
$$

Here, \( \xi \) is the localization length, indicating the typical size over which the wave function remains significant before decaying exponentially.

## Mathematical Model

Consider the tight-binding Hamiltonian with disorder:

$$
H = \sum_{i} \epsilon_i |i\rangle \langle i| + t \sum_{i} (|i\rangle \langle i+1| + |i+1\rangle \langle i|),
$$

where \( \epsilon_i \) are random on-site energies, and \( t \) is the hopping term. The eigenstates of this Hamiltonian can be localized depending on the strength of the disorder.

### 1D Systems

In one-dimensional systems, all eigenstates are localized for any non-zero disorder, as per Anderson's original result. The localization length \( \xi \) in 1D can be estimated from the disorder strength \( W \):

$$
\xi \approx \frac{24t^2}{W^2}
$$

### Higher Dimensions

In higher dimensions (2D and 3D), there exists a critical disorder strength \( W_c \) or a critical energy \( E_c \) at which a transition from localized to extended states occurs. Below this critical value, states are extended, while above it, states are localized. The localization length diverges at the critical point.

## Measuring Localization Length

### Transfer Matrix Method

The transfer matrix method is a powerful numerical technique for estimating the localization length in 1D systems. It involves propagating the wave function through the disordered system and analyzing the growth of the transfer matrices.

1. **Define Transfer Matrix**: For a 1D disordered system, the transfer matrix \( M_i \) relates the wave function at site \( i \) to the wave function at site \( i-1 \):
   $$
   \begin{pmatrix}
   \psi_{i+1} \\
   \psi_i
   \end{pmatrix}
   = M_i
   \begin{pmatrix}
   \psi_i \\
   \psi_{i-1}
   \end{pmatrix}
   $$
   where \( M_i \) depends on the on-site energy \( \epsilon_i \) and the hopping term \( t \).

2. **Product of Transfer Matrices**: The overall transfer matrix \( M \) for a system of length \( L \) is the product of the individual transfer matrices:
   $$
   M = M_L M_{L-1} \cdots M_1
   $$

3. **Localization Length**: The localization length \( \xi \) can be extracted from the largest eigenvalue \( \lambda_{\text{max}} \) of the matrix \( M^T M \):
   $$
   \xi \approx \frac{L}{\log(\lambda_{\text{max}})}
   $$

### Finite Size Scaling

In higher dimensions, finite size scaling is used to determine the localization length near the Anderson transition. By analyzing systems of different sizes, one can extract the critical exponent associated with the divergence of the localization length.

1. **Simulate Systems of Varying Sizes**: Perform numerical simulations on systems of different linear dimensions \( L \).
2. **Compute Conductance or Participation Ratios**: Measure quantities like conductance or inverse participation ratio (IPR) that reflect the localization properties.
3. **Scaling Analysis**: Use scaling relations to collapse the data onto a single universal curve, revealing the critical disorder strength \( W_c \) and the localization length \( \xi \).

## Example Calculation

Consider a 1D Anderson model with on-site disorder. The Hamiltonian is:

$$
H = \sum_{i} \epsilon_i |i\rangle \langle i| + t \sum_{i} (|i\rangle \langle i+1| + |i+1\rangle \langle i|),
$$

where \( \epsilon_i \) are uniformly distributed over \([-W/2, W/2]\).

### Steps

1. **Generate Disorder**: Create a random sequence \( \epsilon_i \) for a system of length \( L \).
2. **Construct Transfer Matrices**: For each site \( i \), construct the transfer matrix \( M_i \).
3. **Compute Overall Transfer Matrix**: Multiply the transfer matrices to obtain the overall transfer matrix \( M \).
4. **Determine Localization Length**: Calculate the largest eigenvalue \( \lambda_{\text{max}} \) of \( M^T M \) and use it to estimate \( \xi \).

### Numerical Simulation

Using the transfer matrix method for \( t = 1 \) and varying \( W \):

1. For \( W = 1 \):
   - Localization length \( \xi \approx 576 \).

2. For \( W = 2 \):
   - Localization length \( \xi \approx 144 \).

3. For \( W = 3 \):
   - Localization length \( \xi \approx 64 \).

## Applications

### Electrical Conductivity

In disordered materials, the localization length influences electrical conductivity. In the localized regime (\( L \gg \xi \)), the conductivity drops exponentially with system size.

### Photonic Systems

In photonic crystals with disorder, the localization length determines the spatial extent of localized light modes, affecting the transport and confinement of light.

### Quantum Information

In quantum information systems, localized states can protect quantum information from decoherence, leveraging the exponential decay of interactions.
