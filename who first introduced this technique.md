title: who first introduced this technique

**USER**

who first introduced this technique?


**ASSISTANT**

The user is asking about who first introduced negative prompting. I need to think about this carefully. The concept of negative prompting as I described it is actually not from a single seminal paper in the way that Classifier-Free Guidance was introduced by Ho & Salimans (2021). 

Looking at my knowledge, negative prompting as a technique seems to have emerged more organically from the community and practical usage of diffusion models, particularly with tools like Stable Diffusion. The mathematical formalization I provided is somewhat of a post-hoc theoretical treatment of what became a common practice.

However, I should be careful here because:
1. I may not have complete information about the earliest academic introduction of this concept
2. There might be earlier work that formalized this approach
3. The technique might have been introduced in multiple contexts by different researchers

Since this is about academic attribution and I want to be accurate, I should search for information about the origins of negative prompting to give a proper answer.

The search results provide some interesting information, but I don't see a clear attribution of who first introduced negative prompting as a specific technique. Let me search more specifically for the origins and early papers on negative prompting.

I'm still not finding a clear academic attribution for who first introduced negative prompting. Let me search for the earliest papers that might have introduced this concept, particularly looking at the AUTOMATIC1111 interface and the Stable Diffusion community since that seems to be where it became popular.

Excellent! I found some very useful information. From the AUTOMATIC1111 GitHub wiki, it states:

"Negative prompt is a way to use the Stable Diffusion in a way that allows the user to specify what he doesn't want to see, without any extra load or requirements for the model. As far as I know, I was the first to use this approach; the commit that adds it is 757bb7c4."

This suggests that AUTOMATIC1111 (the developer of the stable-diffusion-webui) claims to have been the first to implement negative prompting. Let me search for that specific commit to get more details.

Great! I have found some important information. Based on my searches, I can now provide a more informed answer about who first introduced negative prompting. Let me look for that specific commit to see if I can get more details about when it was first implemented.

Based on my research, I now have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer about who first introduced negative prompting. The key information I found is from the AUTOMATIC1111 stable-diffusion-webui project wiki, where the developer states:

"Negative prompt is a way to use the Stable Diffusion in a way that allows the user to specify what he doesn't want to see, without any extra load or requirements for the model. As far as I know, I was the first to use this approach; the commit that adds it is 757bb7c4."

So it appears that AUTOMATIC1111 (the pseudonymous developer of the stable-diffusion-webui interface) claims to have been the first to introduce negative prompting as a practical implementation. However, I should note that this is a claim from a community developer rather than an academic paper.

The research also shows that negative prompting emerged organically from the community rather than being introduced in a formal academic paper. The technique became popular through practical usage in tools like AUTOMATIC1111's web interface.

Let me provide a comprehensive answer to the user.Based on the research, the **practical implementation** of negative prompting appears to have been first introduced by **AUTOMATIC1111**, the pseudonymous developer of the widely-used stable-diffusion-webui interface. According to the project's documentation, AUTOMATIC1111 states: "As far as I know, I was the first to use this approach; the commit that adds it is 757bb7c4."

However, it's important to note that negative prompting **did not originate from a single academic paper** or formal research publication. Instead, it emerged organically from the [[open-source community]] around Stable Diffusion in late 2022, as practitioners sought better ways to control generation quality and avoid common artifacts.

## Historical Context

The technique works by "using user-specified text instead of empty string for unconditional_conditioning when doing sampling," which represents a practical insight into how [[Classifier-Free Guidance]] could be leveraged beyond its original formulation.

The mathematical foundation, however, existed earlier in the CFG framework introduced by Ho & Salimans (2021). AUTOMATIC1111's contribution was recognizing that the unconditional term in CFG could be replaced with negative conditioning rather than an empty prompt, effectively implementing what we now formalize as negative prompting.

## Community Development vs. Academic Attribution

Unlike many AI techniques that emerge from formal research papers, negative prompting represents a case where **practical implementation preceded theoretical analysis**. The first comprehensive academic study of negative prompting mechanisms was published much later in 2024, with papers like "Understanding the Impact of Negative Prompts: When and How Do They Take Effect?"

The feature "found extreme popularity among users who remove the usual deformities of Stable Diffusion like extra limbs" and became a standard feature across most Stable Diffusion interfaces.

## Academic Recognition

While AUTOMATIC1111 provided the first practical implementation, recent academic work has begun to formalize the theoretical foundations. Papers like "Dynamic Negative Guidance of Diffusion Models" (2024) have built upon the community's practical insights to develop more sophisticated theoretical frameworks.

The development of negative prompting thus exemplifies how the open-source AI community can drive innovation that later becomes the subject of formal academic research, rather than following the traditional academic-to-practice pipeline.
