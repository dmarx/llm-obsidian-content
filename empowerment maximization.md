## Empowerment Maximization

### Definition
Empowerment maximization is an approach to intrinsic motivation that focuses on maximizing an agentâ€™s potential influence over its future states. It leverages information theory to quantify how much control an agent has over its environment by measuring the mutual information between the agent's actions and the resulting future states. This concept enables agents to seek states where they can exert the most influence, thus enhancing their ability to adapt and thrive in complex environments.

### Mathematical Formalization

#### Empowerment
Empowerment is defined as the maximum mutual information between a sequence of actions and the subsequent future state, given the current state:
$$
C(x_0) := \max_{p(a_0^{T_e-1} | x_0)} I(X_{T_e}; A_0^{T_e-1} | x_0),
$$
where:
- $x_0$ is the initial state.
- $a_0^{T_e-1}$ is the action sequence over a time horizon $T_e$.
- $X_{T_e}$ is the future state.
- $I$ denotes mutual information.

The mutual information $I(X_{T_e}; A_0^{T_e-1} | x_0)$ measures how much knowing the action sequence $A_0^{T_e-1}$ reduces uncertainty about the future state $X_{T_e}$, thereby quantifying the agent's control over its future.

#### Linear Response Approximation
For systems where the control signal $a$ is small, the dynamics can be approximated linearly around the trajectories of the autonomous system (i.e., with no control). The linear response of the state sequence to the action sequence is given by:
$$
\frac{\partial \bar{x}_s}{\partial a_r} = \prod_{\tau=r+2}^{s} \nabla_{\bar{x}} f(\bar{x}_{\tau-1}) g(\bar{x}_r),
$$
where $\nabla_{\bar{x}} f(\bar{x}_{\tau-1})$ is the Jacobian matrix of the dynamics $f$ with respect to the state, and $g(\bar{x}_r)$ represents the control gain.

The generalized empowerment, considering arbitrary durations of action and observation sequences, is:
$$
C_{T_e, T_a, \Delta T}(x_0) := \max_{p(\mathbf{a} | x_0)} I(X_{T_e}^{T_a + \Delta T}; A_0^{T_a - 1} | x_0),
$$
where:
- $T_a$ denotes the number of time steps at which actions are performed.
- $\Delta T$ is the time gap between the action sequence and the beginning of the observation of the resulting states.
- $T_e$ is the last step in the observed sequence.

### Practical Algorithm

#### Computation of Empowerment
To compute empowerment efficiently for arbitrary dynamical systems:
1. **Discretize Time**: Discretize the continuous dynamics to a time-stepped version.
2. **Linear Response Matrix**: Calculate the linear response matrix $\mathbb{F}$, representing the sensitivity of state sequences to action sequences.
3. **Singular Value Decomposition**: Compute the singular values of the response matrix $\mathbb{F}$.
4. **Water Filling Algorithm**: Apply the water filling procedure to determine the channel powers $\sigma_i$ that maximize the mutual information under a power constraint $P$:
   $$
   C_{T_e, T_a, \Delta T}(x_0) = \max_{\sigma_i \geq 0, \sum_i \sigma_i = P} \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{d_x} \ln(1 + \rho_i(x_0) \sigma_i),
   $$
   where $\rho_i(x_0)$ are the singular values of the submatrix of $\mathbb{F}$.

### Applications

#### Inverted Pendulum
The inverted pendulum is a classic control problem where the agent must balance a pendulum upright. Using empowerment maximization, the agent identifies states where it has the most control and adjusts its actions to maintain balance without explicit reward signals.

#### Double Pendulum
A double pendulum presents a more complex scenario with potentially chaotic dynamics. Empowerment maximization guides the agent to stabilize both links of the pendulum by maximizing its control over future states, illustrating the robustness of the method.

#### Cart-Pole System
In the cart-pole system, the agent controls a cart to balance an inverted pendulum mounted on it. By applying forces to the cart based on empowerment maximization, the agent can effectively stabilize the pendulum.

### Conclusion
Empowerment maximization provides a powerful framework for intrinsic motivation, enabling agents to autonomously develop adaptive behaviors by maximizing their control over future states. This approach can be applied to various control problems and is particularly useful in scenarios where traditional reinforcement learning methods face challenges due to sparse rewards or complex dynamics.
