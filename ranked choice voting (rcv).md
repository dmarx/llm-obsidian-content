### Ranked Choice Voting (RCV)

Ranked Choice Voting (RCV), also known as Instant Runoff Voting (IRV), is a voting system that allows voters to rank candidates in order of preference. If no candidate receives a majority of first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and their votes are transferred to the voters' next preferences. This process continues until a candidate achieves a majority, ensuring that the elected candidate has broad support.

### Key Concepts

1. **Ranking**: Voters rank candidates in order of preference (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.).
2. **Majority**: A candidate needs more than 50% of the votes to win.
3. **Elimination and Transfer**: If no candidate receives a majority, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and their votes are transferred to the next preference indicated on the ballots.

### Example of RCV Process

Consider an election with four candidates: A, B, C, and D, and 100 voters with the following preferences:

- 40 voters rank: A > B > C > D
- 30 voters rank: B > C > D > A
- 20 voters rank: C > D > B > A
- 10 voters rank: D > C > B > A

**First Round**:
- A: 40 votes
- B: 30 votes
- C: 20 votes
- D: 10 votes

No candidate has a majority (more than 50 votes), so the candidate with the fewest votes (D) is eliminated.

**Second Round**:
- D's 10 votes are transferred to the next preference (C), resulting in:
- A: 40 votes
- B: 30 votes
- C: 30 votes (20 + 10 from D)

No candidate has a majority, so the candidate with the fewest votes (B and C tie; typically, tie-breaking rules apply) is eliminated. Let's assume B is eliminated.

**Third Round**:
- B's 30 votes are transferred to the next preference (mostly A and some to C), resulting in:
- A: 70 votes (40 + 30 from B)
- C: 30 votes

Now, A has a majority (70 votes), and A is declared the winner.

### Advantages of RCV

1. **Majority Support**: Ensures that the winning candidate has broad support, as they must receive a majority of votes after transfers.
2. **Reduction of Spoiler Effect**: Reduces the impact of minor candidates splitting the vote, as votes can be transferred to voters' next preferences.
3. **Encourages Positive Campaigning**: Candidates are incentivized to appeal to a broader audience, including those who might rank them as their second or third choice.
4. **Voter Choice**: Voters can express their preferences more fully without worrying about wasting their vote on a less popular candidate.

### Disadvantages of RCV

1. **Complexity**: The voting process and vote counting are more complex compared to simple plurality voting, which may confuse some voters.
2. **Counting Process**: The elimination and transfer process requires more sophisticated vote-counting mechanisms and can be time-consuming.
3. **Potential for Non-Majority Winners**: In some rare cases, the candidate with the initial most first-choice votes might lose in the final round due to vote transfers.

### Implementation Examples

- **Australia**: The House of Representatives uses RCV for its elections.
- **United States**: Various cities and states, including San Francisco and Maine, use RCV for local and state elections.
- **United Kingdom**: Used for certain elections, such as the London mayoral elections.

### Mathematical Formulation

Consider an election with \( n \) candidates and \( m \) voters. Each voter ranks the candidates. Let \( v_{ij} \) denote the vote of voter \( i \) for candidate \( j \), where a lower number indicates a higher preference (e.g., 1 for first choice).

#### First Round:
1. Count the number of first-choice votes for each candidate.
2. If a candidate receives more than 50% of the votes, they are declared the winner.

#### Subsequent Rounds:
1. Eliminate the candidate with the fewest votes.
2. Transfer the votes of the eliminated candidate to the next preferred candidate indicated on those ballots.
3. Repeat the process until a candidate receives more than 50% of the votes.

### Strategic Voting in RCV

While RCV reduces the incentive for [[strategic voting]] compared to plurality systems, some strategic behavior can still occur. Voters might rank a less preferred but more viable candidate higher to influence the elimination process and improve the chances of their most preferred candidate winning.

### Conclusion

Ranked Choice Voting (RCV) is a robust voting system that enhances majority support, reduces the spoiler effect, and encourages positive campaigning. While it introduces complexity in the voting and counting process, its benefits in providing a more representative outcome make it an attractive alternative to traditional plurality [[voting systems]]. Understanding the mechanics and implications of RCV is crucial for adopting electoral reforms that improve the fairness and effectiveness of democratic processes.
