**ASSISTANT**

### **Assignment: Implementing Agent Communication for Simulating Debates**

In this assignment, we will extend the simple **Agent** abstraction to build a system where multiple agents can **chat among themselves**. The goal is to simulate a debate between agents that hold **equally valid but philosophically incompatible positions**. This system will allow us to observe how the agents present their arguments, critique each other’s perspectives, and engage in structured conversations.

### **Objective**:
1. Extend the simple **Agent** abstraction to enable inter-agent communication.
2. Implement a system that allows agents to simulate debates based on philosophically incompatible positions.
3. Create mechanisms for **argumentation**, **critique**, and **response** within the debate.
4. Build a structured conversation flow where agents can challenge each other while maintaining consistency.

---

### **Step 1: Revisiting the Simple Agent Abstraction**

We start with the basic **Agent** abstraction, which defines an agent capable of generating responses to queries. The agent has a **system prompt** that defines its role or position.

#### **Simple Agent Definition**:

```python
class Agent:
    def __init__(self, name, system_prompt_template):
        """
        Initialize the agent with a name and a system prompt template.
        
        Arguments:
        - name: The name of the agent.
        - system_prompt_template: The prompt that defines the agent's role or position.
        """
        self.name = name
        self.system_prompt_template = system_prompt_template
        self.history = []  # Track conversation history

    def get_system_prompt(self):
        """
        Render the system prompt that defines the agent's perspective or philosophical position.
        """
        return self.system_prompt_template

    def query_openai(self, user_input):
        """
        Simulate querying a language model to generate a response.
        
        Arguments:
        - user_input: The input or statement to respond to.
        
        Returns:
        - A response generated by the agent based on the input.
        """
        # Simulate agent thinking and responding
        self.history.append({"role": "user", "content": user_input})
        
        # Simulated response (In practice, you'd query an LLM like GPT-4)
        response = f"As {self.name}, my response to '{user_input}' is based on {self.get_system_prompt()}."
        
        self.history.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response})
        return response
```

This **Agent** abstraction represents an entity with a particular philosophical position (defined by its `system_prompt_template`), and it can generate responses to queries.

---

### **Step 2: Setting Up Philosophically Incompatible Agents**

To simulate a debate, we’ll define agents that hold **philosophically incompatible positions**. These positions will be reflected in their system prompts.

#### **Example Philosophical Positions**:

1. **Agent 1 (Utilitarian)**: Believes in maximizing overall happiness, regardless of individual rights.
2. **Agent 2 (Deontologist)**: Believes in following moral rules or duties, even if it leads to less overall happiness.

We will define two agents with these positions.

```python
# Define system prompts for each agent
utilitarian_prompt = "You are a utilitarian philosopher. Your goal is to maximize overall happiness, even if it means sacrificing individual rights."
deontologist_prompt = "You are a deontologist philosopher. You believe that moral rules must be followed, regardless of the consequences for overall happiness."

# Create agents
agent_utilitarian = Agent(name="Utilitarian Agent", system_prompt_template=utilitarian_prompt)
agent_deontologist = Agent(name="Deontologist Agent", system_prompt_template=deontologist_prompt)
```

---

### **Step 3: Implementing the Debate System**

We will implement a simple **DebateManager** that facilitates conversation between the agents. The debate will proceed in turns, with one agent presenting an argument and the other responding. Each agent will critique the other’s position, followed by a rebuttal.

#### **DebateManager Implementation**:

```python
class DebateManager:
    def __init__(self, agents):
        """
        Initialize the Debate Manager with a set of agents.
        
        Arguments:
        - agents: A list of Agent objects participating in the debate.
        """
        self.agents = agents

    def run_debate(self, topic):
        """
        Run a debate between the agents on a given topic.
        
        Arguments:
        - topic: The topic of the debate.
        
        Returns:
        - The final output of the debate, including arguments, critiques, and rebuttals.
        """
        print(f"Debating topic: {topic}\n")
        
        # Step 1: Each agent presents their initial argument
        arguments = {}
        for agent in self.agents:
            print(f"{agent.name} presents their argument:")
            argument = agent.query_openai(f"What is your position on {topic}?")
            print(f"{agent.name}: {argument}\n")
            arguments[agent.name] = argument

        # Step 2: Each agent critiques the other agent's argument
        for i, agent in enumerate(self.agents):
            for other_agent in self.agents:
                if agent != other_agent:
                    print(f"{agent.name} critiques {other_agent.name}'s argument:")
                    critique = agent.query_openai(f"Critique {other_agent.name}'s position on {topic}.")
                    print(f"{agent.name}: {critique}\n")

        # Step 3: Each agent presents a rebuttal to the critique
        for agent in self.agents:
            for other_agent in self.agents:
                if agent != other_agent:
                    print(f"{agent.name} rebuts {other_agent.name}'s critique:")
                    rebuttal = agent.query_openai(f"Rebut {other_agent.name}'s critique of your position.")
                    print(f"{agent.name}: {rebuttal}\n")
```

---

### **Step 4: Running the Debate**

Now, we can run a debate on a specific philosophical topic (e.g., **"Is it morally acceptable to sacrifice one person to save five?"**) and see how the agents interact.

#### **Running the Debate**:

```python
# Initialize the Debate Manager with the two agents
debate_manager = DebateManager(agents=[agent_utilitarian, agent_deontologist])

# Run the debate on the selected topic
debate_topic = "Is it morally acceptable to sacrifice one person to save five?"
debate_manager.run_debate(debate_topic)
```

#### **Example Output**:

```
Debating topic: Is it morally acceptable to sacrifice one person to save five?

Utilitarian Agent presents their argument:
Utilitarian Agent: As Utilitarian Agent, my response to 'What is your position on Is it morally acceptable to sacrifice one person to save five?' is based on You are a utilitarian philosopher. Your goal is to maximize overall happiness, even if it means sacrificing individual rights.

Deontologist Agent presents their argument:
Deontologist Agent: As Deontologist Agent, my response to 'What is your position on Is it morally acceptable to sacrifice one person to save five?' is based on You are a deontologist philosopher. You believe that moral rules must be followed, regardless of the consequences for overall happiness.

Utilitarian Agent critiques Deontologist Agent's argument:
Utilitarian Agent: As Utilitarian Agent, my response to 'Critique Deontologist Agent's position on Is it morally acceptable to sacrifice one person to save five?' is based on You are a utilitarian philosopher...

Deontologist Agent critiques Utilitarian Agent's argument:
Deontologist Agent: As Deontologist Agent, my response to 'Critique Utilitarian Agent's position on Is it morally acceptable to sacrifice one person to save five?' is based on You are a deontologist philosopher...

Utilitarian Agent rebuts Deontologist Agent's critique:
Utilitarian Agent: As Utilitarian Agent, my response to 'Rebut Deontologist Agent's critique of your position' is based on You are a utilitarian philosopher...

Deontologist Agent rebuts Utilitarian Agent's critique:
Deontologist Agent: As Deontologist Agent, my response to 'Rebut Utilitarian Agent's critique of your position' is based on You are a deontologist philosopher...
```

### **Step 5: Customizing the Debate**

You can extend this basic framework in several ways:
1. **Adding More Agents**: Include more agents with other philosophical positions (e.g., **Virtue Ethics**, **Moral Relativism**).
2. **Adding More Rounds**: Extend the debate by adding multiple rounds of arguments, critiques, and rebuttals.
3. **Moderation**: Introduce a **Moderator Agent** to guide the debate, ensuring fairness and relevance.

---

### **Step 6: Adding Dynamic Behavior**

To make the debate more interactive, you could allow agents to adjust their arguments based on feedback. For example, after receiving a critique, an agent could modify its original position to account for weaknesses.

#### **Example**:

```python
for i in range(2):  # Allow two rounds of argument and critique
    for agent in self.agents:
        argument = agent.query_openai(f"Revised position on {topic} after feedback.")
        print(f"{agent.name}'s revised position: {argument}\n")
```

### **Learning Outcomes**:

1. **Inter-Agent Communication**: Students will learn how to design agents that can interact with each other by exchanging arguments, critiques, and rebuttals.
   
2. **Philosophical Reasoning**: By simulating debates on philosophical topics, students will explore how different moral positions can be argued and defended logically.
   
3. **Structured Conversations**: This assignment demonstrates how to structure agent conversations in a meaningful way, enabling deeper multi-agent interactions.


**ASSISTANT**

4. **Abstraction Design**: The assignment teaches students how to design a simple abstraction like the **Agent** and extend it to handle more complex behaviors (e.g., argumentation).

---

### **Assignment Extension Ideas**:

1. **Multi-Agent Debate**: Introduce more than two agents with different perspectives (e.g., consequentialist, virtue ethicist, contractarian) and allow a multi-agent debate.
   
2. **Scoring Mechanism**: Implement a scoring system where agents evaluate the strength of each other's arguments and select a "winner" based on reasoning quality.

3. **Role-Specific Behavior**: Allow each agent to have specific strategies for debate (e.g., **critic** agent that focuses only on critiquing others, **defender** agent that defends its position no matter what).

---

### **Summary**:

In this assignment, we extended the basic **Agent** abstraction to build a system where multiple agents can engage in structured debates on philosophical topics. By simulating debates between agents with different philosophical positions, students gain insight into inter-agent communication, reasoning, and structured conversation flows. This system can be further extended by adding new agents, more rounds of debate, or dynamic modifications to arguments based on feedback.
