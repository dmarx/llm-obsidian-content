title: notion of a potential

**USER**

the notion of a "potential"


**ASSISTANT**

The notion of a **"potential"** in mathematics and physics refers to a scalar or vector quantity from which certain fields or behaviors can be *derived*, typically via differentiation. The most common contexts involve scalar and vector potentials in vector calculus and field theory, particularly within [[Classical Mechanics]], [[Electromagnetism]], and [[Potential Theory]].

We can lay out the concept rigorously by focusing on the **scalar potential** and **vector potential** in the context of vector fields:

### Scalar Potential

Let $\mathbf{F} : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n$ be a **conservative vector field**. A **scalar potential function** $\phi : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ is a scalar field such that:

$$
\mathbf{F} = -\nabla \phi
$$

Here, $\nabla$ denotes the gradient operator. This means that the vector field $\mathbf{F}$ is the negative gradient of some scalar function $\phi$. The minus sign is conventional in physics (especially in mechanics and electrostatics), where the force points "downhill" on the potential landscape.

#### Properties:

- $\mathbf{F}$ is **irrotational**: $\nabla \times \mathbf{F} = \mathbf{0}$.
- Path independence: The line integral of $\mathbf{F}$ between two points depends only on the endpoints.
- $\phi$ exists **locally** wherever $\mathbf{F}$ is smooth and irrotational; existence globally often requires simple connectivity of the domain.

### Vector Potential

A **vector potential** $\mathbf{A}$ for a vector field $\mathbf{B}$ satisfies:

$$
\mathbf{B} = \nabla \times \mathbf{A}
$$

That is, the vector field $\mathbf{B}$ is the **curl** of another vector field $\mathbf{A}$. This is prevalent in [[Electromagnetism]]: the magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ can be derived from a vector potential $\mathbf{A}$.

#### Properties:

- $\mathbf{B}$ is **divergence-free**: $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0$.
- The vector potential is not unique; it is defined up to a **gauge transformation**:
  $$
  \mathbf{A}' = \mathbf{A} + \nabla \chi
  $$
  for any scalar field $\chi$.

### Potential in Mechanics

In classical mechanics, the potential energy function $V(\mathbf{x})$ is a scalar potential for the **conservative force** $\mathbf{F}$:

$$
\mathbf{F} = -\nabla V(\mathbf{x})
$$

Here, $V$ determines how particles move under the influence of $\mathbf{F}$, and is central in defining [[Lagrangian Mechanics]] and [[Hamiltonian Mechanics]] formulations.

### Generalization

The concept of "potential" can be broadened via **differential forms**:

- A **0-form** is a scalar function (i.e., a potential function).
- A **1-form** is a differential form that, when exact (i.e., the exterior derivative of a 0-form), corresponds to a conservative vector field.
- In general, a differential form $\omega$ is **exact** if there exists another form $\alpha$ such that $\omega = d\alpha$, and $\alpha$ is then a "potential" for $\omega".

This is a modern, coordinate-free language that generalizes the classical notion of potential.
