**USER**

negative prompting


**ASSISTANT**

The user wants me to write a wiki entry on "negative prompting" in the context of diffusion models and classifier-free guidance. This is a technique where you use undesired conditions with negative weights to steer generation away from certain concepts or styles. I need to provide a detailed technical explanation with mathematical formulations, keeping in mind the user's background in applied mathematics and their preference for deep technical detail.

I should cover:
1. Mathematical formulation of negative prompting
2. How it extends classifier-free guidance
3. Theoretical understanding
4. Implementation details
5. Applications and use cases
6. Limitations and considerations
7. Related concepts

I need to use wiki-style double brackets for novel terms and provide concrete mathematical formalisms.# Negative Prompting

**Negative Prompting** is an extension of [[Classifier-Free Guidance]] that enables explicit control over undesired content generation by incorporating negative conditioning signals with negative guidance weights. This technique allows users to specify not only what they want to generate, but also what they want to explicitly avoid, providing enhanced control over the [[denoising process]] in [[diffusion models]].

## Mathematical Foundation

Building upon standard [[Classifier-Free Guidance]], negative prompting extends the guidance formula to incorporate both positive and negative conditions. Let:
- $c^+$ represent the positive (desired) condition
- $c^-$ represent the negative (undesired) condition  
- $w^+, w^- \in \mathbb{R}$ be the positive and negative guidance scales respectively

The **negative prompting prediction** is formulated as:

$$\tilde{\epsilon}_\theta(x_t, t, c^+, c^-) = \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t, \emptyset) + w^+ [\epsilon_\theta(x_t, t, c^+) - \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t, \emptyset)] - w^- [\epsilon_\theta(x_t, t, c^-) - \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t, \emptyset)]$$

This can be rewritten in compact form as:
$$\tilde{\epsilon}_\theta = (1 + w^+ + w^-) \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t, \emptyset) + w^+ \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t, c^+) - w^- \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t, c^-)$$

## Gradient Field Interpretation

From a [[variational perspective]], negative prompting approximates sampling from a modified energy landscape. The effective [[score function]] becomes:

$$\nabla_{x_t} \log p(x_t) \approx -\epsilon_\theta(x_t, t, \emptyset) + w^+ \nabla_{x_t} \log p(c^+|x_t) - w^- \nabla_{x_t} \log p(c^-|x_t)$$

The negative term $-w^- \nabla_{x_t} \log p(c^-|x_t)$ creates a [[repulsive force]] in the direction that would increase the likelihood of the negative condition, effectively steering generation away from unwanted concepts.

## Multi-Condition Negative Prompting

For multiple positive conditions $\{c^+_1, \ldots, c^+_m\}$ and negative conditions $\{c^-_1, \ldots, c^-_n\}$:

$$\tilde{\epsilon}_\theta = \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t, \emptyset) + \sum_{i=1}^m w^+_i \Delta^+_i - \sum_{j=1}^n w^-_j \Delta^-_j$$

where:
- $\Delta^+_i = \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t, c^+_i) - \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t, \emptyset)$
- $\Delta^-_j = \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t, c^-_j) - \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t, \emptyset)$

## Theoretical Analysis

### Energy-Based Model Perspective

Negative prompting corresponds to sampling from an [[energy-based model]] with energy function:

$$E(x, c^+, c^-) = E_{\text{uncond}}(x) - w^+ \log p(c^+|x) + w^- \log p(c^-|x)$$

The partition function becomes:
$$Z = \int p(x)^{1-w^+-w^-} p(x|c^+)^{w^+} p(x|c^-)^{-w^-} dx$$

### Information-Theoretic Framework

Let $I(X; C)$ denote [[mutual information]]. Negative prompting optimizes the objective:

$$\mathcal{J} = I(X; C^+) - \lambda I(X; C^-)$$

where $\lambda > 0$ controls the strength of negative conditioning. This formulation seeks to maximize information shared with positive conditions while minimizing information shared with negative conditions.

### Contrastive Learning Connection

The negative prompting objective exhibits structural similarity to [[contrastive learning]]:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{contrastive}} = -\log \frac{p(x|c^+)}{p(x|c^+) + \sum_j p(x|c^-_j)}$$

This connection suggests that negative prompting performs implicit [[representation learning]] in the latent space of the diffusion model.

## Implementation Strategies

### Standard Implementation
```
For each timestep t:
    ε_uncond = model(x_t, t, null_condition)
    ε_pos = model(x_t, t, positive_condition)
    ε_neg = model(x_t, t, negative_condition)
    
    ε_guided = ε_uncond + w_pos * (ε_pos - ε_uncond) - w_neg * (ε_neg - ε_uncond)
    x_{t-1} = sampling_step(x_t, ε_guided, t)
```

### Computational Optimization

Since negative prompting requires additional forward passes, several optimization strategies are employed:

#### Batched Inference
Combine multiple condition evaluations in a single batch:
$$\text{batch} = [\emptyset, c^+, c^-_1, c^-_2, \ldots]$$

#### Selective Negative Guidance
Apply negative guidance only during specific timestep ranges $[t_{\text{start}}, t_{\text{end}}]$ where $t_{\text{start}} > t_{\text{end}}$, typically focusing on early denoising steps where [[semantic content]] is determined.

#### Adaptive Weighting
Use timestep-dependent negative weights:
$$w^-(t) = w^-_{\max} \cdot \exp(-\alpha t)$$

This concentrates negative guidance during early generation phases and reduces interference with fine detail refinement.

## Practical Applications

### Content Filtering
Remove unwanted elements from generated images:
- Positive: "beautiful landscape"
- Negative: "people, buildings, vehicles"

### Style Transfer Avoidance
Generate content in desired style while avoiding specific artistic influences:
- Positive: "portrait painting"  
- Negative: "photorealistic, anime style"

### Bias Mitigation
Reduce demographic or cultural biases in generation:
- Positive: "professional headshot"
- Negative: "gender stereotypes, age bias"

### Quality Enhancement
Improve generation quality by avoiding common artifacts:
- Positive: "high resolution artwork"
- Negative: "blurry, low quality, artifacts, distorted"

## Strength Calibration

The effectiveness of negative prompting depends critically on weight selection. Define the [[negative guidance ratio]]:

$$r = \frac{w^-}{w^+}$$

Empirical studies suggest optimal ranges:
- $r \in [0.1, 0.5]$: Subtle negative influence
- $r \in [0.5, 1.0]$: Moderate negative control  
- $r > 1.0$: Strong negative guidance (risk of [[concept bleeding]])

## Limitations and Failure Modes

### Concept Entanglement
When positive and negative concepts share [[latent representations]], negative prompting may inadvertently suppress desired features. For highly correlated concepts $c^+$ and $c^-$:

$$\text{Cor}(\epsilon_\theta(\cdot, c^+), \epsilon_\theta(\cdot, c^-)) > \tau_{\text{threshold}}$$

leads to [[destructive interference]] in the guidance signal.

### Semantic Drift
Excessive negative weights can cause [[semantic drift]], where the generation moves toward an unintended region of the data manifold. This occurs when:

$$\|\tilde{\epsilon}_\theta - \epsilon_\theta(\cdot, \emptyset)\| > \sigma_{\text{drift}}$$

### Null Space Collapse
Strong negative guidance may push generation toward the [[null space]] of the negative condition, potentially reducing overall generation quality and diversity.

## Advanced Techniques

### Hierarchical Negative Prompting
Structure negative conditions hierarchically:
$$c^-_{\text{hierarchy}} = \{c^-_{\text{category}}, c^-_{\text{subcategory}}, c^-_{\text{specific}}\}$$

with decreasing weights: $w^-_{\text{category}} > w^-_{\text{subcategory}} > w^-_{\text{specific}}$

### Conditional Negative Prompting
Make negative prompting conditional on generation progress:
$$w^-(t, x_t) = w^-_{\text{base}} \cdot f(\text{feature\_similarity}(x_t, c^-))$$

### Compositional Negative Guidance
Combine multiple negative concepts with [[logical operators]]:
- **AND**: $w^-_{\text{combined}} = \min(w^-_1, w^-_2)$
- **OR**: $w^-_{\text{combined}} = w^-_1 + w^-_2 - w^-_1 w^-_2$

## Evaluation Metrics

### Negative Adherence Score
Quantify how well generation avoids negative concepts:
$$\text{NAS} = 1 - \mathbb{E}[\text{similarity}(\text{generated}, c^-)]$$

### Positive-Negative Trade-off
Measure the balance between positive adherence and negative avoidance:
$$\text{PNT} = \frac{\text{positive\_score}}{\text{positive\_score} + \alpha \cdot \text{negative\_score}}$$
