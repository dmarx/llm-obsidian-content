title: to help situate depth scores, every time you report a score, associate it also
  with a randomly sampled d-1 and d+1 in the neighborhood of that item.

**USER**

to help situate depth scores, every time you report a score, associate it also with a randomly sampled d-1 and d+1 in the neighborhood of that item.


**ASSISTANT**

Let me revise one of our earlier topic chains to demonstrate this contextualization:

## Example Chain: Complexity Theory Path
*Each entry shown with related predecessor and successor topics*

- δ:2 [[Computational Complexity Basics]]
    ↓
1. δ:3 [[Blum Complexity Axioms]]
    - Predecessor: [[Resource Bounded Computing]] (δ:2)
    - Successor: [[Abstract Resource Measures]] (δ:4)
    ↓
2. δ:4 [[Descriptional Complexity]]
    - Predecessor: [[Blum Complexity Axioms]] (δ:3)
    - Successor: [[Program Size Hierarchies]] (δ:5)
    ↓
3. δ:5 [[Implicit Complexity Theory]]
    - Predecessor: [[Type-Based Analysis]] (δ:4)
    - Successor: [[Safe Recursion Schemes]] (δ:6)
    ↓
4. δ:6 [[Linear Logic Complexity]]
    - Predecessor: [[Resource Logics]] (δ:5)
    - Successor: [[Substructural Type Systems]] (δ:7)
    ↓
5. δ:7 [[Ordinal Analysis of Provers]]
    - Predecessor: [[Proof Theory Hierarchies]] (δ:6)
    - Successor: [[Large Cardinal Strength]] (δ:8)
    ↓
6. δ:8 [[Transfinite Kolmogorov Complexity]]
    - Predecessor: [[Ordinal Computability]] (δ:7)
    - Successor: (At maximum depth)

This contextualization helps readers understand:
1. What topics typically precede this level of complexity
2. What topics might naturally follow
3. The gradual progression of conceptual sophistication

Would you like me to apply this format to other topic chains or depth analyses we've discussed?
