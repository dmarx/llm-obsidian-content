### Functional Connectivity

**Definition:** Functional connectivity refers to the statistical dependencies or correlations between neural activities in different regions of the brain, indicating how these regions communicate and coordinate with each other to support cognitive and behavioral functions. It is typically assessed using neuroimaging techniques like fMRI, EEG, and MEG.

### Key Concepts

#### Functional vs. Structural Connectivity

- **Functional Connectivity:** Describes the temporal correlations between remote neurophysiological events. It does not necessarily imply direct anatomical connections but indicates functional interactions.
- **Structural Connectivity:** Refers to the physical connections between brain regions, such as white matter tracts, typically assessed with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).

#### Types of Functional Connectivity

1. **Seed-Based Correlation Analysis:** Measures the correlation between the time series of a selected brain region (seed) and other regions.
2. **Independent Component Analysis (ICA):** Decomposes the fMRI signal into independent spatial components, identifying networks of synchronized activity.
3. **Granger Causality Analysis:** Assesses directional influences between brain regions, indicating potential causal relationships.
4. **Dynamic Functional Connectivity:** Examines how functional connectivity patterns change over time during rest or task performance.

### Neuroimaging Techniques

#### Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)

- **BOLD Signal:** Functional connectivity is often assessed using the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal, which reflects changes in blood flow related to neural activity.
- **Resting-State fMRI:** Measures spontaneous brain activity while the subject is at rest, revealing intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs).

#### Electroencephalography (EEG) and Magnetoencephalography (MEG)

- **EEG:** Measures electrical activity on the scalp, providing high temporal resolution but limited spatial resolution.
- **MEG:** Measures magnetic fields produced by neural activity, offering better spatial resolution than EEG but still less than fMRI.
- **Coherence and Phase Synchronization:** Functional connectivity in EEG and MEG is often assessed through measures of coherence and phase synchronization between signals from different electrodes or sensors.

### Functional Connectivity Networks

#### Default Mode Network (DMN)

- **Function:** Involved in self-referential thinking, daydreaming, and mind-wandering. It is active when the brain is at rest and deactivates during goal-directed tasks.
- **Components:** Includes the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and angular gyrus.

#### Salience Network

- **Function:** Detects and filters salient stimuli, switching between the DMN and task-positive networks.
- **Components:** Includes the anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex.

#### Central Executive Network (CEN)

- **Function:** Supports working memory, decision-making, and cognitive control.
- **Components:** Includes the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex.

#### Sensorimotor Network

- **Function:** Involved in planning and executing movements and processing sensory feedback.
- **Components:** Includes the primary motor cortex, primary somatosensory cortex, and supplementary motor area.

### Clinical Applications

#### Neurological Disorders

- **Parkinson's Disease:** Altered functional connectivity patterns are observed in motor and cognitive networks, correlating with symptoms such as motor dysfunction and cognitive decline.
- **Alzheimer's Disease:** Disruptions in the DMN and other networks are linked to cognitive impairments and disease progression.

#### Psychiatric Disorders

- **Depression:** Abnormal functional connectivity in the DMN, [[salience network]], and CEN has been associated with mood regulation issues and cognitive symptoms.
- **Schizophrenia:** Altered connectivity patterns in multiple networks, including the DMN and CEN, are related to symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, and cognitive deficits.

### Research and Advances

#### Connectomics

- **Human Connectome Project:** Aims to map the functional and structural connectivity of the human brain, providing a comprehensive understanding of brain network organization.
- **Graph Theory:** Used to analyze the brain's network properties, such as nodes (brain regions) and edges (functional connections), offering insights into the brain's organizational principles.

#### Machine Learning

- **Pattern Recognition:** Machine learning algorithms are applied to functional connectivity data to identify patterns associated with specific cognitive states or disease conditions.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Used to predict individual differences in behavior, cognition, and disease progression based on functional connectivity profiles.

### Summary

Functional connectivity refers to the statistical relationships between neural activities in different brain regions, reflecting how these regions communicate and coordinate. Assessed using neuroimaging techniques like fMRI, EEG, and MEG, functional connectivity helps identify intrinsic brain networks such as the default mode network, [[salience network]], and [[central executive]] network. Understanding functional connectivity has clinical applications in diagnosing and managing neurological and psychiatric disorders, and research advances in [[connectomics]] and machine learning continue to enhance our knowledge of brain network organization and function.
