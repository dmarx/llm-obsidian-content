title: forward–backward operator

**USER**

forward–backward operator


**ASSISTANT**

The **forward-backward operator** is a concept in the analysis of dynamical systems, particularly in the context of [[transfer operators]]. It refers to the combination of the Perron-Frobenius operator (forward operator) and the Koopman operator (backward operator) to provide a comprehensive understanding of the evolution of densities and observables. This approach leverages the dual nature of these operators to analyze the system from both probabilistic and deterministic perspectives.

### Forward Operator: Perron-Frobenius Operator

The **Perron-Frobenius operator** $\mathcal{P}$ describes the evolution of probability densities under a dynamical system. For a discrete-time system with a map $\varphi: \mathbb{X} \to \mathbb{X}$, the Perron-Frobenius operator acts on a density function $\rho(x)$ as follows:
$$
(\mathcal{P} \rho)(y) = \sum_{x \in \varphi^{-1}(y)} \frac{\rho(x)}{|\det D\varphi(x)|},
$$
where $\varphi^{-1}(y)$ denotes the preimages of $y$ under $\varphi$, and $D\varphi(x)$ is the Jacobian determinant of $\varphi$ at $x$.

### Backward Operator: Koopman Operator

The **Koopman operator** $\mathcal{K}$ describes the evolution of observables (functions of the state) under a dynamical system. For the same discrete-time system with map $\varphi$, the Koopman operator acts on an observable $g(x)$ as:
$$
(\mathcal{K} g)(x) = g(\varphi(x)).
```

### Combining Forward and Backward Operators

The forward-backward operator approach leverages both the Perron-Frobenius and Koopman operators to analyze the system. This dual perspective allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the dynamics, capturing both the statistical evolution of densities and the deterministic evolution of observables.

#### Duality

The Perron-Frobenius operator $\mathcal{P}$ and the Koopman operator $\mathcal{K}$ are adjoints in the sense of functional analysis. This relationship is expressed as:
$$
\int_{\mathbb{X}} (\mathcal{K} g)(x) \rho(x) \, dx = \int_{\mathbb{X}} g(x) (\mathcal{P} \rho)(x) \, dx,
$$
for any density $\rho(x)$ and observable $g(x)$. This duality reflects how the evolution of observables under $\mathcal{K}$ corresponds to the evolution of densities under $\mathcal{P}$.

### Spectral Analysis

Spectral analysis of the forward-backward operators provides insights into the dynamical system's long-term behavior:

1. **Eigenvalues and Eigenfunctions**:
   - For the Koopman operator $\mathcal{K}$: If $\phi$ is an eigenfunction with eigenvalue $\lambda$, then $\mathcal{K} \phi = \lambda \phi$.
   - For the Perron-Frobenius operator $\mathcal{P}$: If $\rho$ is an eigenfunction with eigenvalue $\mu$, then $\mathcal{P} \rho = \mu \rho$.

2. **Invariant Measures and Functions**: The eigenfunctions associated with eigenvalue 1 provide invariant measures (for $\mathcal{P}$) and invariant functions (for $\mathcal{K}$).

3. **Spectral Gap**: The difference between the largest and second-largest eigenvalues indicates the mixing rate and decay of correlations.

### Applications

1. **Ergodic Theory**: Combining forward and backward operators helps in studying invariant measures, ergodicity, and mixing properties.
2. **Data-Driven Modeling**: Techniques like Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) utilize these operators to extract dynamic modes from data.
3. **Control Theory**: In control systems, understanding the duality between densities and observables aids in designing effective controllers and observers.
4. **Statistical Mechanics**: These operators help analyze the evolution of distributions in phase space, particularly in high-dimensional systems.

### Example: Simple Dynamical System

Consider a simple one-dimensional dynamical system given by the map $\varphi(x) = 2x \mod 1$ (the doubling map). The Perron-Frobenius and Koopman operators for this map can be analyzed as follows:

#### Perron-Frobenius Operator

For a density function $\rho(x)$, the Perron-Frobenius operator $\mathcal{P}$ is:
$$
(\mathcal{P} \rho)(y) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \rho\left( \frac{y}{2} \right) + \rho\left( \frac{y + 1}{2} \right) \right).
```

#### Koopman Operator

For an observable $g(x)$, the Koopman operator $\mathcal{K}$ is:
$$
(\mathcal{K} g)(x) = g(2x \mod 1).
```

#### Combined Analysis

By analyzing both operators, we can understand how a distribution of points evolves under the map (forward perspective) and how functions of the state evolve (backward perspective). This dual analysis helps identify invariant densities, periodic orbits, and other dynamical features.

### Conclusion

The forward-backward operator approach, utilizing the Perron-Frobenius and Koopman operators, provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing dynamical systems. This dual perspective captures both the probabilistic and deterministic aspects of the system, offering deep insights into its long-term behavior.
