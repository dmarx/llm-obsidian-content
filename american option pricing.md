American Option Pricing


**ASSISTANT**

### American Option Pricing

**American options** are financial derivatives that can be exercised at any time before or at the expiration date. This flexibility differentiates them from European options, which can only be exercised at expiration. Pricing American options involves determining their value considering this early exercise feature.

### Key Concepts

1. **Option Types**:
   - **Call Option**: Gives the holder the right to buy an asset at a specified strike price \(K\).
   - **Put Option**: Gives the holder the right to sell an asset at a specified strike price \(K\).

2. **Early Exercise**: The holder can choose to exercise the option at any point up to and including the expiration date, adding complexity to the pricing model.

### Pricing Methods

#### 1. **Binomial Tree Model**

The binomial tree model is a popular method for pricing American options. It discretizes the time to expiration into multiple steps, modeling possible paths the underlying asset price can take.

##### Steps to Construct a Binomial Tree:

1. **Set Parameters**:
   - Current stock price \(S\).
   - Strike price \(K\).
   - Risk-free interest rate \(r\).
   - Volatility \(\sigma\).
   - Time to expiration \(T\).
   - Number of time steps \(n\).

2. **Calculate Time Step**:
   \[
   \Delta t = \frac{T}{n}
   \]

3. **Up and Down Factors**:
   \[
   u = e^{\sigma \sqrt{\Delta t}}, \quad d = \frac{1}{u}
   \]

4. **Risk-Neutral Probabilities**:
   \[
   p = \frac{e^{r \Delta t} - d}{u - d}
   \]

5. **Construct Stock Price Tree**:
   At each node, the stock price can move up or down:
   \[
   S_{i,j} = S \cdot u^j \cdot d^{i-j}
   \]
   where \(i\) is the step and \(j\) is the number of up moves.

6. **Calculate Option Value at Terminal Nodes**:
   For a call option:
   \[
   C_{i,j} = \max(0, S_{i,j} - K)
   \]
   For a put option:
   \[
   P_{i,j} = \max(0, K - S_{i,j})
   \]

7. **Backward Induction**:
   Move backward through the tree, calculating the option value at each node as the maximum of the intrinsic value and the discounted expected future value:
   \[
   C_{i,j} = \max(S_{i,j} - K, e^{-r \Delta t} (p \cdot C_{i+1,j+1} + (1-p) \cdot C_{i+1,j}))
   \]
   \[
   P_{i,j} = \max(K - S_{i,j}, e^{-r \Delta t} (p \cdot P_{i+1,j+1} + (1-p) \cdot P_{i+1,j}))
   \]

#### Example Calculation:

1. **Parameters**:
   - \(S = 100\)
   - \(K = 100\)
   - \(r = 0.05\)
   - \(\sigma = 0.2\)
   - \(T = 1\) year
   - \(n = 3\)

2. **Calculations**:
   - \(\Delta t = \frac{1}{3} = 0.333\)
   - \(u = e^{0.2 \sqrt{0.333}} \approx 1.122\)
   - \(d = \frac{1}{1.122} \approx 0.892\)
   - \(p = \frac{e^{0.05 \cdot 0.333} - 0.892}{1.122 - 0.892} \approx 0.53\)

3. **Stock Price Tree**:

   ```
   Step 0:      100
              /    \
   Step 1:   112.2  89.2
            /  \   /  \
   Step 2: 125.97 100 79.56
          /   \  /  \  /  \
   Step 3:141.4 112.2 89.2 63.1
   ```

4. **Option Values at Maturity** (for a call option):
   - Step 3: \(C(3,0) = \max(0, 141.4 - 100) = 41.4\)
   - Step 3: \(C(3,1) = \max(0, 112.2 - 100) = 12.2\)
   - Step 3: \(C(3,2) = \max(0, 89.2 - 100) = 0\)
   - Step 3: \(C(3,3) = \max(0, 63.1 - 100) = 0\)

5. **Backward Induction**:
   - Step 2: \(C(2,0) = \max(125.97 - 100, e^{-0.05 \cdot 0.333} (0.53 \cdot 41.4 + 0.47 \cdot 12.2)) = 28.94\)
   - Step 2: \(C(2,1) = \max(100 - 100, e^{-0.05 \cdot 0.333} (0.53 \cdot 12.2 + 0.47 \cdot 0)) = 6.44\)
   - Step 2: \(C(2,2) = \max(79.56 - 100, e^{-0.05 \cdot 0.333} (0.53 \cdot 0 + 0.47 \cdot 0)) = 0\)

   Continue this process to get the option value at Step 0.

### 2. **Black-Scholes Model (with Adjustments)**

The Black-Scholes model is primarily used for European options, but it can be adjusted for American options by incorporating early exercise premiums or using numerical methods like finite difference methods.

#### Adjusted Black-Scholes for American Options:

1. **Analytical Approximation**: Adjust the Black-Scholes formula to account for early exercise, though this is often less accurate than numerical methods.
2. **Finite Difference Methods**: Solve the Black-Scholes partial differential equation (PDE) on a discrete grid, allowing for the possibility of early exercise at each time step.

### Conclusion

American option pricing requires consideration of the early exercise feature, adding complexity to the pricing models. The binomial tree model is a widely used method due to its flexibility and ease of implementation. While the Black-Scholes model is not directly applicable, adjustments and numerical methods can extend it to American options. These methods allow traders and risk managers to accurately value American options and make informed decisions in financial markets.
