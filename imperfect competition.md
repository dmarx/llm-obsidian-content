Imperfect competition


**ASSISTANT**

Imperfect competition is a market structure where firms have some degree of market power, allowing them to set prices above marginal cost. This contrasts with perfect competition, where firms are price takers and cannot influence the market price. Imperfect competition can take various forms, including monopolistic competition, oligopoly, and monopoly. It plays a crucial role in New Keynesian economics by introducing price and wage setting behavior that contributes to nominal rigidities and macroeconomic fluctuations.

### Key Concepts

1. **Market Power**:
   In imperfect competition, firms have the ability to influence the price of their products. This market power arises due to product differentiation, barriers to entry, or strategic interactions among firms.

2. **Price Setting**:
   Unlike in perfect competition, where prices are determined by market forces, firms under imperfect competition set prices based on their cost structures, demand conditions, and strategic considerations. This leads to prices being sticky, as firms may not adjust them frequently due to [[menu costs]] or other frictions.

3. **Monopolistic Competition**:
   In this type of market structure, many firms sell products that are close substitutes but differentiated by brand, quality, or other features. Each firm faces a downward-sloping demand curve and has some degree of pricing power.

4. **Oligopoly**:
   An oligopoly is characterized by a small number of firms that dominate the market. These firms are interdependent, meaning the actions of one firm (e.g., changing prices) can significantly impact the others. Strategic behavior, such as price setting, collusion, or competition, is a key feature.

5. **Monopoly**:
   A monopoly exists when a single firm controls the entire market. This firm sets the price higher than marginal cost to maximize profits, leading to inefficiencies such as reduced output and higher prices compared to a perfectly competitive market.

### Mathematical Formalism

To illustrate the role of imperfect competition in macroeconomic models, consider a simple model of monopolistic competition:

1. **Demand Function**:
   Each firm $i$ faces a downward-sloping demand curve:
   $$
   Y_t(i) = \left(\frac{P_t(i)}{P_t}\right)^{-\epsilon} Y_t
   $$
   where $Y_t(i)$ is the output of firm $i$, $P_t(i)$ is the price set by firm $i$, $P_t$ is the aggregate price level, $Y_t$ is aggregate output, and $\epsilon > 1$ is the price elasticity of demand.

2. **Profit Maximization**:
   Firms set prices to maximize profits, taking into account their market power. The profit function for firm $i$ is:
   $$
   \Pi_t(i) = P_t(i) Y_t(i) - MC_t Y_t(i)
   $$
   where $MC_t$ is the marginal cost.

3. **Optimal Price Setting**:
   The optimal price set by the firm, considering its market power, is given by:
   $$
   P_t(i) = \frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon - 1} MC_t
   $$
   This markup over marginal cost reflects the firm's pricing power. The markup $\mu = \frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon - 1}$ is higher the lower the elasticity of demand $\epsilon$.

4. **Aggregate Price Level**:
   The aggregate price level is determined by the weighted average of individual prices:
   $$
   P_t = \left[ \int_0^1 P_t(i)^{1-\epsilon} di \right]^{\frac{1}{1-\epsilon}}
   $$

### Implications for Macroeconomics

1. **Price Stickiness**:
   Imperfect competition explains why prices are sticky. Firms may face [[menu costs]] or strategic considerations that make them reluctant to change prices frequently, leading to nominal rigidities.

2. **Non-neutrality of Money**:
   With price stickiness, changes in the money supply can have real effects on output and employment, as prices do not adjust immediately to monetary shocks.

3. **Inflation Dynamics**:
   The presence of imperfect competition affects inflation dynamics. Firms' price-setting behavior, influenced by their market power and expectations, contributes to the persistence of inflation and the transmission of monetary policy.

4. **Welfare Implications**:
   Imperfect competition can lead to welfare losses due to inefficient allocation of resources. Prices above marginal cost reduce consumer surplus and overall economic efficiency.

### Applications in New Keynesian Economics

Imperfect competition is a cornerstone of New Keynesian economics, providing the microeconomic foundations for models that explain price and wage stickiness, the effects of monetary policy, and the dynamics of inflation and output.

1. **Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) Models**:
   DSGE models incorporate imperfect competition to study how firms' price-setting behavior and nominal rigidities affect macroeconomic outcomes. These models are used to analyze the impact of policy interventions and economic shocks.

2. **New Keynesian Phillips Curve (NKPC)**:
   The NKPC is derived from models with imperfect competition, where firms set prices based on their marginal costs and market conditions. This framework explains the relationship between inflation, expectations, and economic activity.

3. **Policy Analysis**:
   Understanding imperfect competition helps policymakers design effective monetary and fiscal policies. For instance, recognizing the role of price stickiness can inform decisions on interest rates and other tools to stabilize the economy.

### Conclusion

Imperfect competition is essential for understanding the complexities of real-world markets and the macroeconomic implications of firms' price-setting behavior. By incorporating elements of imperfect competition, modern economic models can better capture the dynamics of inflation, output, and the effects of monetary policy, providing valuable insights for policymakers and economists.
