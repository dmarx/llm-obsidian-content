Genetic Drift


**ASSISTANT**

**Genetic drift** is a fundamental mechanism of evolution that refers to random fluctuations in allele frequencies within a population from one generation to the next. Unlike natural selection, which acts on traits based on their fitness, genetic drift is a stochastic process that occurs due to **sampling error** in small populations. Over time, genetic drift can lead to the fixation or loss of alleles in a population, especially when the population size is small.

### Key Features of Genetic Drift

1. **Random Process**: Genetic drift is caused by the random sampling of alleles from one generation to the next. This random sampling results in changes in allele frequencies that are not driven by the selective advantages or disadvantages of those alleles.

2. **Stronger in Small Populations**: The effects of genetic drift are more pronounced in small populations because the smaller the population, the more significant the role of chance in determining which alleles are passed on. In larger populations, random fluctuations tend to average out, and the impact of drift is smaller.

3. **Allele Fixation or Loss**: Over time, genetic drift can lead to the fixation (where an allele reaches a frequency of 1) or loss (where an allele reaches a frequency of 0) of alleles. The probability of an allele being fixed is proportional to its initial frequency in the population.

4. **Loss of Genetic Variation**: Genetic drift reduces genetic diversity within populations, as alleles are either fixed or lost. This reduction in diversity can decrease a population’s ability to adapt to environmental changes or new selective pressures.

5. **Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution**: In the context of [[molecular evolution]], genetic drift is a key component of the **Neutral Theory** proposed by [[Motoo Kimura]], which posits that most evolutionary changes at the molecular level are the result of neutral mutations becoming fixed through drift, rather than through natural selection.

### Mathematical Formalism of Genetic Drift

Genetic drift can be modeled mathematically, often using the **Wright-Fisher model** or the **Moran model**. In these models, a finite population of \( N \) individuals reproduces over discrete generations, and allele frequencies are subject to random changes due to sampling error.

1. **Wright-Fisher Model**: In the Wright-Fisher model, the population reproduces in non-overlapping generations, and each individual in the next generation is formed by randomly drawing alleles from the current generation.

   - If \( p_t \) is the frequency of an allele \( A \) in generation \( t \), the frequency in the next generation \( t+1 \) will follow a **binomial distribution**:
   $$
   p_{t+1} \sim \text{Binomial}(N, p_t)
   $$
   where \( N \) is the population size, and \( p_t \) is the probability of drawing the allele \( A \) in generation \( t \).

2. **Moran Model**: The Moran model assumes overlapping generations where each reproduction event involves replacing one randomly chosen individual with an offspring. This model also accounts for genetic drift and typically leads to slower allele frequency changes compared to the Wright-Fisher model.

3. **Fixation Probability**: The probability that a neutral allele will become fixed by drift is equal to its initial frequency. For a neutral allele with frequency \( p \) in a diploid population of size \( N \), the probability of fixation is:
   $$
   P_{\text{fixation}} = p = \frac{k}{2N}
   $$
   where \( k \) is the number of copies of the allele in the population (assuming diploidy).

4. **Time to Fixation or Loss**: The expected time to fixation or loss of a neutral allele depends on the population size. In a population of effective size \( N_e \), the expected time for an allele to either fix or be lost is approximately:
   $$
   T_{\text{fixation}} \approx 4N_e \text{ generations}
   $$
   for a neutral allele.

5. **Variance in Allele Frequencies**: The variance in allele frequency due to drift can be described using the binomial sampling process. In a single generation, the variance in allele frequency \( p \) is:
   $$
   \text{Var}(p_{t+1}) = \frac{p_t(1 - p_t)}{2N}
   $$

### Population Size and Genetic Drift

**Effective population size** (\( N_e \)) is a key factor in determining the strength of genetic drift. It represents the size of an idealized population that would experience the same amount of drift as the real population. Factors such as unequal sex ratios, variation in reproductive success, and population bottlenecks reduce \( N_e \), intensifying the effects of genetic drift.

- **Small Populations**: In small populations, drift can quickly lead to the fixation or loss of alleles, even if those alleles have no fitness effect. The smaller the population, the stronger the role of drift relative to selection.
- **Large Populations**: In large populations, drift is weaker because the effects of random fluctuations in allele frequencies are averaged out across more individuals. As a result, selection plays a more dominant role in shaping allele frequencies.

### Genetic Drift in Special Cases

1. **Bottlenecks**: A **population bottleneck** occurs when a population's size is drastically reduced for a short period of time. During the bottleneck, genetic drift acts strongly, often leading to the loss of genetic diversity and the fixation of certain alleles by chance. Even after the population recovers, the effects of the bottleneck can persist due to the reduced genetic variation.

2. **Founder Effects**: The **founder effect** is a special case of genetic drift that occurs when a small number of individuals colonize a new area, establishing a new population with a limited gene pool. The small size of the founder population results in strong drift, which can lead to the fixation of alleles that were rare in the original population.

3. **Neutral Alleles and Drift**: In the **[[neutral theory of [[molecular evolution]]]]**, drift is the primary mechanism by which neutral mutations (those with no effect on fitness) spread through a population. The rate at which neutral mutations are fixed depends on the mutation rate \( \mu \) and the population size \( N_e \):
   $$
   k = \mu
   $$
   where \( k \) is the rate of neutral substitutions, independent of population size.

### Genetic Drift vs. Natural Selection

- **Genetic Drift**: Acts randomly, affecting all alleles regardless of their effect on fitness. It is most powerful in small populations, where random sampling can cause rapid changes in allele frequencies.
  
- **Natural Selection**: Acts non-randomly, favoring alleles that increase an organism’s fitness and eliminating deleterious alleles. In large populations, selection is the dominant force, whereas in small populations, drift can overwhelm selection.

In populations of intermediate size, **drift and selection interact**. The relative strength of selection compared to drift can be described by the product \( N_e s \), where \( s \) is the selection coefficient. If \( N_e s \gg 1 \), selection dominates; if \( N_e s \ll 1 \), drift dominates, and the allele behaves almost neutrally.

### Examples and Applications

1. **Cheetah Bottleneck**: Cheetahs are a classic example of a species that experienced a severe population bottleneck, leading to very low genetic diversity. The effects of genetic drift during the bottleneck reduced heterozygosity and contributed to the species' current vulnerability to disease.

2. **Human Genetic Diversity**: Genetic drift has played a significant role in shaping human genetic diversity, especially in small, isolated populations. The **out-of-Africa hypothesis** for human evolution suggests that as human populations migrated out of Africa, they experienced founder effects, resulting in reduced genetic diversity in non-African populations.

3. **Molecular Evolution**: In [[molecular evolution]], genetic drift is often responsible for the fixation of neutral mutations. These neutral changes can be used to build **molecular clocks** that estimate divergence times between species based on the accumulation of neutral substitutions.

### Conclusion

**Genetic drift** is a powerful evolutionary force, especially in small populations, where it can lead to significant changes in allele frequencies purely by chance. It plays a central role in the **[[neutral theory of [[molecular evolution]]]]**, in which most genetic changes are thought to be neutral and fixed by drift rather than by selection. Understanding genetic drift is crucial for interpreting patterns of genetic diversity, evolutionary dynamics, and the long-term viability of populations, particularly those at risk of inbreeding or bottleneck effects.
