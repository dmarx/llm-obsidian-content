Belbin's "Resource Investigator" Team Role


**ASSISTANT**

The "Resource Investigator" is one of the nine team roles identified in Meredith Belbin's Team Roles model. This role is critical for exploring and exploiting opportunities and for bringing fresh ideas and insights into a team. Resource Investigators are often the extroverts in the team, enthusiastic and communicative, adept at networking and negotiating with others both within and outside of the team.

### Characteristics of the Resource Investigator

**Strengths**: Resource Investigators are typically very outgoing and enthusiastic. They have excellent interpersonal skills, making them good at communicating and negotiating. They are adept at exploring opportunities and making contacts that can bring external ideas, resources, and information into the organization or team.

**Behavioral Traits**:
- Resource Investigators are often very sociable and thrive on engaging with a wide range of people.
- They are optimistic and positive, which can be contagious, helping to motivate the team and drive projects forward.
- They are good at thinking on their feet and are flexible, often able to respond well to challenges.

### Contributions to the Team

1. **Networking**: They use their extensive networks to bring in new ideas, opportunities, and information that can be vital for the success of projects.
2. **Initiating Contacts**: They are often the ones who will reach out to make new business contacts, find new markets, or bring in external expertise.
3. **Inspiring Enthusiasm**: Given their optimistic outlook, they help to keep team morale high, particularly in the face of setbacks or when projects hit roadblocks.

### Allowable Weaknesses

Despite their invaluable contributions, Resource Investigators have potential weaknesses that might affect team performance:
- **Loss of Interest**: Their initial enthusiasm might wane over time, particularly if projects become slow-moving or routine.
- **Over-Optimism**: Their natural optimism might lead them to underestimate obstacles, leading to issues down the line.
- **Focus on External Relations**: Sometimes, their focus on external networking can lead them to neglect some of the fine details and follow-through required within the team.

### Managing a Resource Investigator

To maximize the effectiveness of a Resource Investigator, consider the following strategies:
- Encourage them to follow up on leads and ensure they maintain the momentum of their contacts and ideas.
- Provide them with support to handle the detail-oriented aspects of projects, pairing them with team members who excel in follow-through.
- Regularly re-engage them with new challenges and opportunities to keep their enthusiasm high.

### Ideal Scenarios for Resource Investigators

Resource Investigators are especially valuable in roles where new ideas, external contacts, or opportunities need to be continuously identified and explored. They are well-suited to business development roles, marketing, sales, and roles that require partnership and network building. Their skills are particularly beneficial in start-up environments or new venture teams where establishing a foothold and rapid growth are critical.

In summary, the Resource Investigator plays a pivotal role in keeping teams and projects vibrant and connected to a wider world of possibilities. They bring energy, openness, and a progressive outlook that can make the difference between stagnation and growth in dynamic environments.
