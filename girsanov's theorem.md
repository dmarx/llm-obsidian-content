Girsanov's Theorem


**ASSISTANT**

### Girsanov's Theorem

**Girsanov's Theorem** is a fundamental result in stochastic calculus and mathematical finance. It provides a method for changing the probability measure such that the drift term in a stochastic differential equation (SDE) is modified, while preserving the structure of the Brownian motion. This theorem is especially useful in the context of risk-neutral pricing and transforming SDEs.

### Key Concepts

1. **Probability Measures**: \( P \) and \( Q \) are two probability measures on the same probability space.
2. **Radon-Nikodym Derivative**: The density process \( \frac{dQ}{dP} \) is used to change the measure from \( P \) to \( Q \).
3. **Brownian Motion**: Under the original measure \( P \), \( W_t \) is a Brownian motion. The theorem describes how \( W_t \) transforms under the new measure \( Q \).

### Statement of Girsanov's Theorem

Let \( \{ W_t \} \) be a Brownian motion under the probability measure \( P \). Consider an adapted process \( \{ \theta_t \} \) such that \( \int_0^t \theta_s^2 \, ds < \infty \) almost surely for all \( t \). Define a new process \( \{ W_t^Q \} \) by:

$$
W_t^Q = W_t + \int_0^t \theta_s \, ds
$$

Under the new measure \( Q \), where \( Q \) is defined via the Radon-Nikodym derivative:

$$
\left. \frac{dQ}{dP} \right|_{\mathcal{F}_t} = \exp \left( -\int_0^t \theta_s \, dW_s - \frac{1}{2} \int_0^t \theta_s^2 \, ds \right),
$$

the process \( \{ W_t^Q \} \) is a Brownian motion.

### Interpretation

Girsanov's Theorem essentially states that by appropriately adjusting the drift term of a Brownian motion, one can transform it into another Brownian motion under a new probability measure. This transformation is crucial for changing between the real-world measure and the risk-neutral measure in financial mathematics.

### Applications in Finance

#### 1. **Risk-Neutral Pricing**

In financial mathematics, the risk-neutral measure \( Q \) is used to price derivatives. Girsanov's Theorem helps in transforming the SDEs of asset prices from the real-world measure \( P \) to the risk-neutral measure \( Q \).

For a stock price \( S_t \) following the SDE:

$$
dS_t = \mu S_t \, dt + \sigma S_t \, dW_t,
$$

Girsanov's Theorem allows us to change the measure such that under \( Q \), the stock price dynamics become:

$$
dS_t = r S_t \, dt + \sigma S_t \, dW_t^Q,
$$

where \( r \) is the risk-free rate and \( W_t^Q \) is a Brownian motion under \( Q \).

#### 2. **Martingale Representation**

Girsanov's Theorem ensures that the discounted stock price \( \frac{S_t}{B_t} \) (where \( B_t \) is the risk-free bond price) is a martingale under the risk-neutral measure \( Q \):

$$
E^Q \left[ \frac{S_T}{B_T} \mid \mathcal{F}_t \right] = \frac{S_t}{B_t}.
$$

This property is fundamental in the pricing of derivatives.

### Mathematical Derivation

To derive the measure change, we start with a Brownian motion \( W_t \) under measure \( P \) and define a new process \( \{ X_t \} \):

$$
X_t = W_t + \int_0^t \theta_s \, ds.
$$

By Ito's Lemma, the differential of \( X_t \) is:

$$
dX_t = dW_t + \theta_t \, dt.
$$

The process \( \{ X_t \} \) has a drift term \( \theta_t \) and is no longer a martingale under \( P \). To transform \( X_t \) back into a Brownian motion under a new measure \( Q \), we use the Radon-Nikodym derivative:

$$
\left. \frac{dQ}{dP} \right|_{\mathcal{F}_t} = Z_t = \exp \left( -\int_0^t \theta_s \, dW_s - \frac{1}{2} \int_0^t \theta_s^2 \, ds \right).
$$

### Verification

To verify that \( W_t^Q \) is a Brownian motion under \( Q \), we need to check the properties of Brownian motion:

1. **Starting Point**: \( W_0^Q = 0 \).
2. **Independent Increments**: Under \( Q \), the increments of \( W_t^Q \) are independent.
3. **Normality**: The increments \( W_t^Q - W_s^Q \) are normally distributed with mean 0 and variance \( t-s \).

By construction, \( W_t^Q \) satisfies these properties under the new measure \( Q \), thus confirming that \( W_t^Q \) is indeed a Brownian motion.

### Example: Change of Measure in Option Pricing

Consider a stock price \( S_t \) governed by:

$$
dS_t = \mu S_t \, dt + \sigma S_t \, dW_t^P.
$$

To price options, we change to the risk-neutral measure \( Q \) where the dynamics are:

$$
dS_t = r S_t \, dt + \sigma S_t \, dW_t^Q,
$$

with the Radon-Nikodym derivative:

$$
\left. \frac{dQ}{dP} \right|_{\mathcal{F}_t} = \exp \left( -\int_0^t \frac{\mu - r}{\sigma} \, dW_s^P - \frac{1}{2} \int_0^t \left( \frac{\mu - r}{\sigma} \right)^2 \, ds \right).
$$

### Conclusion

Girsanov's Theorem provides a powerful framework for changing probability measures, allowing for the transformation of Brownian motions and facilitating the application of risk-neutral pricing in finance. By understanding and utilizing this theorem, one can effectively model and price financial derivatives, ensuring consistency with market dynamics and the absence of arbitrage.
