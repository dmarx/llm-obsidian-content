### Constant Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA) Utility Function with an Infinite Horizon

The Constant Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA) utility function is commonly used in economic and financial models to describe the preferences of individuals over consumption or wealth, especially in the context of dynamic optimization problems. When applied to an infinite horizon, the CRRA utility function provides a framework for determining optimal consumption and investment strategies that maximize the expected utility over an infinite time period.

#### CRRA Utility Function

The CRRA utility function is given by:

$$ U(c) = \frac{c^{1-\gamma}}{1-\gamma} $$

where:
- \( c \) is the consumption level.
- \( \gamma \) is the coefficient of relative risk aversion. For \( \gamma \neq 1 \), this form is valid. When \( \gamma = 1 \), the utility function becomes \( U(c) = \log(c) \).

#### Infinite Horizon Optimization Problem

In an infinite horizon setting, the objective is to maximize the expected discounted utility of consumption over time. The optimization problem can be formulated as:

$$ \max_{\pi(t), c(t)} E \left[ \int_0^{\infty} e^{-\rho t} \frac{c(t)^{1-\gamma}}{1-\gamma} dt \right] $$

where:
- \( \pi(t) \) is the proportion of wealth invested in the risky asset.
- \( c(t) \) is the consumption rate at time \( t \).
- \( \rho \) is the subjective discount rate, which reflects the individual's time preference.

#### Wealth Dynamics

The [[wealth dynamics]] in this context are typically modeled using a stochastic differential equation (SDE). Assume there is a risk-free asset with return \( r \) and a risky asset with expected return \( \mu \) and volatility \( \sigma \). The wealth \( W(t) \) evolves according to:

$$ dW(t) = \left[ W(t) (r + \pi(t) (\mu - r)) - c(t) \right] dt + \pi(t) W(t) \sigma dB(t) $$

where:
- \( dB(t) \) is a standard Brownian motion.

#### Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) Equation

To solve this optimization problem, we use the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. The value function \( V(W) \) represents the maximum expected utility given the wealth \( W \). For an infinite horizon problem, the HJB equation is:

$$ \rho V(W) = \max_{\pi, c} \left[ \frac{c^{1-\gamma}}{1-\gamma} + V_W(W) \left( W (r + \pi (\mu - r)) - c \right) + \frac{1}{2} V_{WW}(W) (\pi W \sigma)^2 \right] $$

#### Solving the HJB Equation

1. **Optimal Consumption**:
   - Differentiate the HJB equation with respect to \( c \) and set the derivative to zero to find the optimal consumption \( c^* \):

     $$ \frac{\partial}{\partial c} \left( \frac{c^{1-\gamma}}{1-\gamma} - V_W(W) c \right) = c^{-\gamma} - V_W(W) = 0 $$

     Solving for \( c \) gives:

     $$ c^* = \left( V_W(W) \right)^{-\frac{1}{\gamma}} $$

2. **Optimal Investment**:
   - Differentiate the HJB equation with respect to \( \pi \) and set the derivative to zero to find the optimal portfolio \( \pi^* \):

     $$ \frac{\partial}{\partial \pi} \left( V_W(W) W \pi (\mu - r) + \frac{1}{2} V_{WW}(W) (\pi W \sigma)^2 \right) = V_W(W) W (\mu - r) + V_{WW}(W) \pi W^2 \sigma^2 = 0 $$

     Solving for \( \pi \) gives:

     $$ \pi^* = -\frac{V_W(W)}{V_{WW}(W)} \frac{\mu - r}{\sigma^2 W} = \frac{\mu - r}{\gamma \sigma^2} $$

     Here, \( \gamma = -\frac{W V_{WW}(W)}{V_W(W)} \), the relative risk aversion coefficient.

3. **Value Function**:
   - Assume a functional form for the value function:

     $$ V(W) = \frac{W^{1-\gamma}}{1-\gamma} A $$

     Substituting \( V(W) \), \( V_W(W) = A W^{-\gamma} \), and \( V_{WW}(W) = -\gamma A W^{-\gamma-1} \) into the HJB equation and solving for \( A \), we obtain:

     $$ \rho A W^{1-\gamma} = \max_{\pi, c} \left[ \frac{c^{1-\gamma}}{1-\gamma} + A W^{-\gamma} (W (r + \pi (\mu - r)) - c) + \frac{1}{2} (-\gamma A W^{-\gamma-1}) (\pi W \sigma)^2 W^2 \right] $$

     After simplifying and solving for \( A \), we find:

     $$ A = \left( \frac{(\rho - r(1-\gamma)) + \frac{(\mu - r)^2}{2\gamma \sigma^2}}{\gamma (1-\gamma)} \right) $$

#### Summary

The CRRA utility function in an infinite horizon setting allows for the derivation of optimal consumption and investment strategies. By solving the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, we obtain the following optimal policies:

- **Optimal Consumption**: \( c^* = \left( V_W(W) \right)^{-\frac{1}{\gamma}} \)
- **Optimal Investment**: \( \pi^* = \frac{\mu - r}{\gamma \sigma^2} \)

These strategies ensure that the individual's expected utility over an infinite horizon is maximized, considering their relative risk aversion and the dynamics of the financial market. The value function, reflecting the maximum expected utility, takes the form \( V(W) = \frac{W^{1-\gamma}}{1-\gamma} A \), where \( A \) is a constant determined by the model parameters.
