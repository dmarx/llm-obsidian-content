Prospect Theory in Games

### Prospect Theory in Games

**Prospect Theory**, developed by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, describes how people make choices under risk. It departs from the expected utility theory by emphasizing that people value gains and losses differently, leading to decisions that deviate from rational expectations. Integrating Prospect Theory into game theory provides a framework to better understand how players perceive and respond to risks in strategic settings.

### Key Concepts of Prospect Theory

1. **Value Function**: The value function is defined over gains and losses relative to a reference point rather than absolute outcomes. It is concave for gains, convex for losses, and steeper for losses than for gains, reflecting loss aversion.
   - Mathematically: 
     $$
     v(x) = 
     \begin{cases} 
     x^\alpha & \text{if } x \geq 0 \\
     -\lambda (-x)^\beta & \text{if } x < 0 
     \end{cases}
     $$
     where $0 < \alpha, \beta \leq 1$ and $\lambda > 1$ indicates loss aversion.

2. **Probability Weighting**: People tend to overweight small probabilities and underweight large probabilities.
   - Weighting function: 
     $$
     \pi(p) = \frac{p^\gamma}{(p^\gamma + (1-p)^\gamma)^{1/\gamma}}
     $$
     where $\gamma \leq 1$.

3. **Reference Dependence**: Outcomes are evaluated based on their deviation from a reference point, which can be the status quo, an aspiration level, or another benchmark.

### Integrating Prospect Theory into Game Theory

#### Adjusted Payoffs

In games, players’ payoffs are transformed according to the value function. The expected utility under prospect theory, $U_i^{PT}$, for player $i$ choosing strategy $s_i$ against opponents’ strategies $\mathbf{s}_{-i}$ is:

$$
U_i^{PT}(s_i, \mathbf{s}_{-i}) = \sum_{s_{-i}} \pi(P(s_{-i})) v(u_i(s_i, s_{-i}) - r_i)
$$

where:
- $u_i(s_i, s_{-i})$ is the actual payoff for player $i$.
- $r_i$ is the reference point for player $i$.
- $\pi(P(s_{-i}))$ is the probability weighting function.
- $v(u_i(s_i, s_{-i}) - r_i)$ is the value function applied to the deviation from the reference point.

#### Example: Ultimatum Game

Consider the [[Ultimatum Game]], where player 1 (the proposer) offers a division of a sum of money to player 2 (the responder), who can either accept or reject the offer. If player 2 rejects, both players get nothing.

- Traditional Analysis: Player 1 offers the smallest possible amount, expecting player 2 to accept any positive amount.
- Prospect Theory Analysis: Player 2 evaluates the offer relative to their reference point (e.g., an equal split), and the value function for losses (rejections) is steeper than for gains (acceptances).

Let the total amount be $10. Player 1 offers $x$, and player 2 accepts if the perceived utility exceeds their reference point:

$$
v(x - r_2) = 
\begin{cases} 
x^\alpha & \text{if } x \geq r_2 \\
-\lambda (r_2 - x)^\beta & \text{if } x < r_2 
\end{cases}
$$

If player 2's reference point is $5 (an equal split)$, they are more likely to reject offers perceived as losses, leading player 1 to offer more than the minimum amount to increase the probability of acceptance.

#### Coordination Games

In coordination games, such as the Stag Hunt, where players choose between a risky but high-reward strategy (Stag) and a safe but low-reward strategy (Hare), prospect theory predicts that players' choices will be influenced by their reference points and probability weighting.

- Traditional Nash Equilibrium: Players choose strategies based on maximizing expected payoffs.
- Prospect Theory Adjusted: Players weigh the probabilities of outcomes differently and may prefer safer strategies if potential losses loom larger than gains.

#### Payoff Matrix Transformation

Consider a game with payoffs $(u_i(s_i, s_{-i}))$. Under prospect theory, transform the payoffs using the value function:

1. Define reference points $r_i$ for each player.
2. Apply the value function $v$ to each payoff, adjusting for gains and losses relative to the reference points.
3. Use the transformed payoffs to determine players' strategies by applying the probability weighting function to the expected utilities.

### Implications and Applications

1. **Behavioral Predictions**: Incorporating prospect theory into game theory provides more accurate predictions of actual human behavior in strategic settings, reflecting aversion to losses and the overweighting of small probabilities.
2. **Policy Design**: Understanding how individuals perceive risks and rewards can help design better policies and mechanisms, such as incentive structures that account for loss aversion and probability weighting.
3. **Experimental Economics**: Experimental studies validate prospect theory by showing that real-world decision-makers often deviate from the rational predictions of traditional game theory, exhibiting behaviors consistent with loss aversion and probability weighting.

### Conclusion

Prospect theory enriches game theory by incorporating psychological insights into how players perceive gains, losses, and probabilities. This integration leads to more realistic models of strategic interaction, capturing behaviors such as loss aversion and probability distortion that traditional game theory overlooks. By applying these insights, researchers and policymakers can better predict and influence decision-making in various contexts.
