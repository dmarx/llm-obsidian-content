### Empirically Demonstrated Negative Effects of IPR

Empirical studies have highlighted several negative effects of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) on innovation and economic development, particularly focusing on monopolistic practices, reduced accessibility, and the hindrance of cumulative innovation.

#### 1. Monopolistic Practices and Market Power

**Evidence from the Pharmaceutical Industry**:
- **Evergreening**: Pharmaceutical companies often engage in "evergreening" by making minor modifications to existing drugs to extend their patent life, thus delaying the entry of cheaper generic drugs. This practice can lead to higher drug prices and reduced access to essential medicines【36†source】【37†source】.
- **Case Study**: Research on the U.S. pharmaceutical market shows that extended patents through secondary patents can keep drug prices high and limit competition, negatively impacting consumer welfare and health outcomes【38†source】.

#### 2. Incremental Innovation over Radical Innovation

**Focus on Minor Improvements**:
- **Empirical Studies**: Studies have shown that firms might focus on incremental innovations that can be easily patented rather than investing in more substantial, risky innovations. This phenomenon is observed in industries where patent portfolios are used to create barriers to entry for competitors【37†source】.
- **Example**: Analysis of patent filings reveals that a significant portion of patents are for incremental innovations, which contribute less to technological advancement than more groundbreaking innovations【36†source】.

#### 3. Reduced Accessibility and Higher Costs

**Impact on Developing Countries**:
- **Healthcare Accessibility**: In developing countries, stringent IPR can limit access to affordable medications. The high cost of patented drugs makes them inaccessible to large segments of the population, exacerbating health inequalities【37†source】【38†source】.
- **Case Study**: In countries like South Africa and India, the enforcement of international IPR standards has been linked to increased drug prices, which can impede public health efforts【36†source】.

#### 4. Hindrance of Cumulative Innovation

**Blocking Future Innovations**:
- **Patent Thickets**: The creation of dense webs of overlapping patents, known as patent thickets, can hinder innovation by making it difficult for new entrants to navigate the intellectual property landscape. This can stifle follow-on innovations and slow technological progress【38†source】.
- **Example**: In the technology sector, particularly in software and electronics, patent thickets have been shown to increase litigation costs and create barriers to entry for smaller firms and startups【37†source】.

#### 5. Legal and Enforcement Costs

**Economic Burden**:
- **Litigation and Enforcement**: The costs associated with patent litigation and enforcement can be substantial, diverting resources away from productive R&D activities. This is particularly burdensome for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that lack the financial resources to defend their patents【37†source】.
- **Empirical Data**: Studies indicate that the legal costs and uncertainties associated with IPR litigation can be significant, often deterring innovation and market entry by smaller firms【38†source】.

### Conclusion

While IPR can incentivize innovation by protecting inventors and creators, empirical evidence suggests that it can also lead to negative outcomes such as monopolistic practices, reduced accessibility to essential goods, a focus on incremental rather than radical innovation, the creation of patent thickets, and significant legal and enforcement costs. These negative effects highlight the need for a balanced approach to IPR policy, one that fosters innovation while mitigating the potential downsides, particularly for developing countries and smaller firms.
