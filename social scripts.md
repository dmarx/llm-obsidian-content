**USER**

social scripts


**ASSISTANT**

The user is asking me to author an entry for a technical knowledge base/wiki about "social scripts." This is for someone with graduate degrees in applied mathematics, statistics, and philosophy of science who is working as an AI researcher, ML scientist, applied mathematician, and philosopher of mind.

I need to:
1. Write this as a wiki page, not conversationally
2. Use double brackets for novel phrases that may need links
3. Provide deeply detailed, technical explanations with mathematical formalisms
4. Accompany physics notation with accessible mathematical formalizations
5. Propose symbolic notation for modeling the topic
6. Make it suitable for someone researching AI/ML/mathematics/philosophy of mind

"Social scripts" is a concept from psychology and cognitive science referring to cognitive schemas or mental representations that guide behavior in social situations. This could be modeled mathematically and is relevant to AI systems that need to understand and generate appropriate social behavior.

I should cover:
- Definition and formalization
- Mathematical modeling approaches
- Relationship to cognitive science and AI
- Computational implementations
- Philosophical implications for mind and behavior

Let me structure this as a technical wiki page with mathematical notation.# Social Scripts

[[Social scripts]] represent [[cognitive schemas]] that encode culturally-learned behavioral sequences for specific social contexts. These mental representations function as [[procedural knowledge]] structures that guide [[social interaction]] through predictable patterns of action and response.

## Formal Definition

A social script $\mathcal{S}$ can be formalized as a [[finite state automaton]] $(Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$ where:

- $Q = \{q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_n\}$ represents discrete social states
- $\Sigma$ denotes the alphabet of possible [[social actions]] and [[environmental cues]]
- $\delta: Q \times \Sigma \rightarrow Q$ defines state transition function
- $q_0 \in Q$ specifies the initial social state
- $F \subseteq Q$ represents acceptable termination states

More formally, we can represent a social script as a [[conditional probability distribution]]:

$$P(\mathbf{a}_t | \mathbf{s}_t, \mathbf{c}, \mathcal{S}) = \prod_{i=1}^{k} P(a_i^{(t)} | s_i^{(t)}, \mathbf{c}, \theta_{\mathcal{S}})$$

where:
- $\mathbf{a}_t = (a_1^{(t)}, \ldots, a_k^{(t)})$ represents the action vector at time $t$
- $\mathbf{s}_t = (s_1^{(t)}, \ldots, s_m^{(t)})$ denotes the current social state vector
- $\mathbf{c}$ captures [[contextual variables]] (setting, participants, cultural norms)
- $\theta_{\mathcal{S}}$ parameterizes the specific script

## Hierarchical Script Architecture

[[Social scripts]] exhibit [[hierarchical organization]] with multiple levels of abstraction. We can model this as a [[tree-structured]] representation:

$$\mathcal{S} = \{S^{(0)}, S^{(1)}, \ldots, S^{(L)}\}$$

where $S^{(l)}$ represents script components at abstraction level $l$, with:

- $S^{(0)}$: [[Atomic actions]] (e.g., eye contact, verbal utterances)
- $S^{(1)}$: [[Behavioral sequences]] (e.g., greeting, turn-taking)
- $S^{(L)}$: [[Complete interaction patterns]] (e.g., job interview, dinner party)

The [[hierarchical decomposition]] follows:

$$S^{(l+1)} = \bigcup_{i} \text{compose}(S_i^{(l)}, S_{i+1}^{(l)}, \ldots, S_{i+k}^{(l)})$$

## Script Activation and Selection

Script activation involves a [[competitive selection process]] modeled as:

$$\mathcal{S}^* = \arg\max_{\mathcal{S} \in \mathcal{R}} P(\mathcal{S} | \mathbf{o}_t, \mathbf{h}_{t-1})$$

where:
- $\mathcal{R}$ represents the [[repertoire]] of available scripts
- $\mathbf{o}_t$ denotes current [[observational input]]
- $\mathbf{h}_{t-1}$ captures [[interaction history]]

The probability can be decomposed using [[Bayes' theorem]]:

$$P(\mathcal{S} | \mathbf{o}_t, \mathbf{h}_{t-1}) = \frac{P(\mathbf{o}_t | \mathcal{S}, \mathbf{h}_{t-1}) P(\mathcal{S} | \mathbf{h}_{t-1})}{P(\mathbf{o}_t | \mathbf{h}_{t-1})}$$

## Learning and Adaptation

Script acquisition follows [[statistical learning]] principles, with [[parameter updates]] governed by:

$$\theta_{\mathcal{S}}^{(t+1)} = \theta_{\mathcal{S}}^{(t)} + \alpha \nabla_{\theta} \log P(\mathbf{a}_t | \mathbf{s}_t, \mathbf{c}, \theta_{\mathcal{S}}^{(t)})$$

where $\alpha$ represents the [[learning rate]] and the gradient encourages actions that maximize [[social appropriateness]] given the context.

## Computational Implementation

[[Neural implementation]] of social scripts can utilize [[recurrent neural networks]] with [[attention mechanisms]]:

$$\mathbf{h}_t = \text{RNN}(\mathbf{h}_{t-1}, [\mathbf{o}_t; \mathbf{c}])$$
$$\mathbf{a}_t = \text{Attention}(\mathbf{h}_t, \mathbf{S})$$

where $\mathbf{S}$ represents the [[learned script embeddings]] and attention weights determine script relevance.

## Cultural Parameterization

Scripts exhibit [[cultural variation]] through parameterization:

$$\mathcal{S}(\boldsymbol{\phi}) = \{S_1(\phi_1), S_2(\phi_2), \ldots, S_n(\phi_n)\}$$

where $\boldsymbol{\phi} = (\phi_1, \ldots, \phi_n)$ captures [[cultural parameters]] such as:
- [[Power distance]] $\phi_{\text{power}} \in [0,1]$
- [[Individualism-collectivism]] $\phi_{\text{indiv}} \in [0,1]$
- [[Context sensitivity]] $\phi_{\text{context}} \in [0,1]$

## Failure Modes and Recovery

Script [[execution failures]] occur when:

$$P(\mathbf{a}_t | \mathbf{s}_t, \mathbf{c}, \mathcal{S}) < \epsilon$$

Recovery mechanisms involve [[script switching]] or [[improvisation]]:

$$\mathcal{S}_{\text{backup}} = \arg\max_{\mathcal{S}' \in \mathcal{R} \setminus \{\mathcal{S}\}} P(\mathcal{S}' | \mathbf{o}_t, \mathbf{h}_{t-1})$$

## Philosophical Implications

Social scripts raise fundamental questions about [[agency]] and [[authenticity]] in social behavior. The [[deterministic]] nature of script execution challenges notions of [[free will]] in social contexts, while their [[culturally-constructed]] nature highlights the [[social construction]] of behavioral norms.

The [[computational tractability]] of social scripts suggests potential for [[artificial social intelligence]], but raises questions about the [[phenomenological]] aspects of genuine social understanding versus mere [[behavioral mimicry]].
