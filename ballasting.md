ballasting


**ASSISTANT**

**Ballasting** in the context of microplastic vertical transport refers to the process by which plastic particles, particularly microplastics, become denser due to the attachment of heavier materials like organic matter or minerals. This increased density causes the previously buoyant plastics to sink through the water column, contributing to their eventual deposition in the deep sea.

### Mechanism of Ballasting

The ballasting process is driven by several interactions between plastics and biological or inorganic materials in the marine environment:

1. **Biofouling by Organic Matter**:
   - **Marine organisms**, such as bacteria, algae, and plankton, colonize plastic surfaces in the water. These biological materials increase the effective density of the plastics. Over time, this biofouling can grow thick enough to overcome the natural buoyancy of the plastic, leading to sinking.
   - **Organic aggregates** like marine snow (small clumps of organic matter including dead organisms, fecal pellets, and detritus) often trap microplastics within them. This marine snow has a higher density than seawater, facilitating its descent to deeper layers of the ocean, carrying embedded plastics along with it.

2. **Mineral Aggregation**:
   - Plastics can also aggregate with inorganic particles such as clay, sand, or dust. These particles act as ballast by physically attaching to the microplastic surfaces or becoming incorporated into biofilms. The increased mass per unit volume from mineral loading leads to a downward flux of the plastics.

3. **Fecal Pellets**:
   - Marine organisms, particularly zooplankton, ingest microplastics at the surface. These organisms produce denser fecal pellets, which sink through the water column more rapidly than the individual microplastics themselves. As the plastics are excreted in the fecal matter, this serves as an efficient form of ballasting and vertical transfer.

### Mathematical Representation of Sinking Velocity

The ballasting process directly affects the **sinking velocity** of microplastics. As particles become denser due to biofouling or aggregation, their sinking velocity increases, allowing them to be transported to greater depths. 

For small particles, the sinking velocity can be approximated by **Stokes' Law**:
$$
v_s = \frac{2r^2 (\rho_b - \rho_w) g}{9 \eta}
$$
Where:
- $v_s$ is the sinking velocity,
- $r$ is the radius of the particle (including the ballast),
- $\rho_b$ is the effective density of the ballasted particle (plastic + biofouling/aggregates),
- $\rho_w$ is the density of seawater,
- $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity,
- $\eta$ is the dynamic viscosity of seawater.

As **$\rho_b$** increases due to biological growth or attachment of inorganic matter, the sinking velocity $v_s$ increases, leading to a faster vertical transfer of the plastic particles.

### Implications of Ballasting for Microplastic Fallout

Ballasting is a critical factor in the **vertical redistribution** of plastics from surface waters, like those in the [[North Pacific Garbage Patch]], to the deep sea. This process helps explain why large quantities of plastics are found in ocean sediments despite the concentration of plastics at the surface.

Key implications of ballasting include:
- **Increased sedimentation rates**: Biofouled or mineral-laden plastics sink faster than their unballasted counterparts, contributing to higher rates of [[plastic fallout]] to the ocean floor.
- **Deep-sea plastic pollution**: Through ballasting, plastics are able to bypass the thermocline and reach the deep-sea benthic environment, where they can persist for long periods and interact with deep-sea ecosystems.
- **Global plastic cycle**: Ballasting affects how plastic debris is transported vertically in the ocean, influencing the overall distribution of plastics across surface, mid-water, and deep-sea reservoirs.

Understanding ballasting is crucial for developing models that predict the fate of plastic pollution in marine ecosystems, as it highlights the role of biological and mineral interactions in the global plastic cycle.
