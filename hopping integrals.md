hopping integrals


**ASSISTANT**

Hopping integrals, often denoted as \(t_{ij}\), are crucial parameters in the tight-binding model and related approaches used to describe the electronic properties of solids. These integrals quantify the probability amplitude for an electron to "hop" from one atomic site to another, effectively capturing the overlap between atomic orbitals on neighboring sites.

### Key Concepts

1. **Definition**:
   The hopping integral \(t_{ij}\) represents the matrix element of the Hamiltonian between two atomic orbitals \( \phi_i(\vec{r}) \) and \( \phi_j(\vec{r}) \):
   $$
   t_{ij} = \langle \phi_i | \hat{H} | \phi_j \rangle
   $$
   where \( \hat{H} \) is the Hamiltonian of the system.

2. **On-Site Energy**:
   The on-site energy \(\epsilon_i\) is the energy associated with an electron residing at site \(i\), given by:
   $$
   \epsilon_i = \langle \phi_i | \hat{H} | \phi_i \rangle
   $$

3. **Nearest-Neighbor Hopping**:
   In many tight-binding models, only the nearest-neighbor hopping integrals are considered, simplifying the calculations while capturing the essential physics of electron movement in the crystal.

### Mathematical Formalism

The tight-binding Hamiltonian for a system with hopping integrals and on-site energies can be written as:
$$
\hat{H} = \sum_{i} \epsilon_i c_i^\dagger c_i + \sum_{\langle i, j \rangle} t_{ij} c_i^\dagger c_j
$$
where \( c_i^\dagger \) and \( c_i \) are the creation and annihilation operators for an electron at site \(i\), respectively, and \(\langle i, j \rangle\) denotes a sum over nearest-neighbor pairs.

### Example: 1D Tight-Binding Model

Consider a one-dimensional chain of atoms with a single atomic orbital per site. The Hamiltonian is:
$$
\hat{H} = \sum_{i} \epsilon c_i^\dagger c_i + \sum_{i} t (c_i^\dagger c_{i+1} + c_{i+1}^\dagger c_i)
$$
Assuming uniform on-site energy \(\epsilon_i = \epsilon\) and uniform hopping \(t_{ij} = t\), the Hamiltonian simplifies to:
$$
\hat{H} = \epsilon \sum_{i} c_i^\dagger c_i + t \sum_{i} (c_i^\dagger c_{i+1} + c_{i+1}^\dagger c_i)
$$

To find the energy eigenvalues, we solve the Schr√∂dinger equation in the basis of Bloch states:
$$
\psi_k(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{j} e^{ikx_j} \phi(x - x_j)
$$
where \( k \) is the wavevector, \( N \) is the number of atoms, and \( \phi(x - x_j) \) is the atomic orbital centered at site \(j\).

The eigenvalues are obtained by applying the Hamiltonian to the Bloch states:
$$
\hat{H} \psi_k = E(k) \psi_k
$$

For the 1D chain, this leads to the energy dispersion relation:
$$
E(k) = \epsilon + 2t \cos(k a)
$$
where \( a \) is the lattice constant. This dispersion relation shows that the energy spectrum forms a band, with the width of the band determined by the hopping parameter \( t \).

### Higher-Dimensional Systems

In higher-dimensional systems, the hopping integrals can be generalized to include more complex lattice structures. For instance, in a two-dimensional square lattice, the Hamiltonian is:
$$
\hat{H} = \epsilon \sum_{i,j} c_{i,j}^\dagger c_{i,j} + t \sum_{i,j} \left( c_{i,j}^\dagger c_{i+1,j} + c_{i,j}^\dagger c_{i,j+1} + \text{H.c.} \right)
$$
where \( (i,j) \) denotes the lattice site indices in the two-dimensional grid. The corresponding energy dispersion relation is:
$$
E(\vec{k}) = \epsilon + 2t (\cos(k_x a) + \cos(k_y a))
$$
where \( \vec{k} = (k_x, k_y) \) is the wavevector in the 2D Brillouin zone.

### Applications

1. **Electronic Structure of Materials**:
   Hopping integrals play a crucial role in determining the electronic band structure of materials, helping to explain their electrical, thermal, and optical properties.

2. **Magnetism**:
   In models of magnetism, such as the Hubbard model, hopping integrals describe the movement of electrons between lattice sites, which, coupled with electron-electron interactions, leads to various magnetic phenomena.

3. **Topological Phases**:
   Hopping integrals are essential in models describing topological insulators and other topological phases of matter. By including terms that account for spin-orbit coupling and other interactions, these models can predict the existence of edge states and other topologically protected features.

4. **Quantum Transport**:
   In quantum transport calculations, hopping integrals help model the conductance and other transport properties of nanoscale devices and molecular systems.

### Calculation of Hopping Integrals

Hopping integrals can be calculated using various methods, including:

1. **Empirical Methods**:
   Using experimental data to fit the parameters of the tight-binding model.

2. **First-Principles Calculations**:
   Using density functional theory (DFT) or other ab initio methods to compute the electronic structure and extract the hopping integrals.

3. **Wannier Functions**:
   Constructing maximally localized Wannier functions from the Bloch states and using them to compute the hopping integrals:
   $$
   t_{ij} = \langle w_i | \hat{H} | w_j \rangle
   $$
   where \( w_i \) and \( w_j \) are Wannier functions centered at sites \( i \) and \( j \), respectively.

### Conclusion

Hopping integrals are fundamental parameters in the tight-binding model, capturing the essence of electron movement between atomic sites in a crystal. They play a crucial role in determining the electronic properties of materials, from band structure and magnetism to topological phases and quantum transport. By accurately calculating and understanding hopping integrals, researchers can gain deeper insights into the behavior of electrons in solids and design materials with tailored electronic properties.
