AdS/CFT Correspondence


**ASSISTANT**

The AdS/CFT correspondence, also known as the gauge-gravity duality or Maldacena duality, is a powerful theoretical framework that establishes a relationship between a type of string theory defined on a higher-dimensional space and a conformal field theory (CFT) defined on the boundary of this space. This duality provides deep insights into both quantum gravity and strongly correlated quantum field theories.

## Overview

### Core Idea

The AdS/CFT correspondence posits that a gravity theory in a (d+1)-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS) space is equivalent to a d-dimensional conformal field theory on the boundary of this space. The most well-known example is the duality between Type IIB string theory on AdS\(_5\) × S\(^5\) and \(\mathcal{N}=4\) super-Yang-Mills (SYM) theory in four dimensions.

### Formulation

#### Anti-de Sitter Space (AdS)

AdS space is a maximally symmetric, negatively curved spacetime. For example, AdS\(_{d+1}\) can be thought of as a higher-dimensional hyperbolic space.

#### Conformal Field Theory (CFT)

CFT is a quantum field theory that is invariant under conformal transformations, which include translations, rotations, dilations, and special conformal transformations.

### Maldacena's Conjecture

The conjecture by Juan Maldacena in 1997 states that:
- Type IIB string theory on AdS\(_5\) × S\(^5\) is dual to \(\mathcal{N}=4\) SYM theory in four dimensions.
- The large N limit of SU(N) \(\mathcal{N}=4\) SYM theory with gauge coupling \(g\) corresponds to classical supergravity on AdS\(_5\) × S\(^5\).

### Dictionary of the Duality

The AdS/CFT correspondence provides a dictionary that relates quantities in the gravity theory to those in the field theory. Key elements include:
- **Boundary Correspondence**: The boundary of AdS\(_{d+1}\) is a d-dimensional space where the CFT lives.
- **Correlation Functions**: Correlation functions of the CFT are related to the bulk field theory by evaluating the bulk action on the classical solutions with boundary conditions determined by the CFT sources.
- **Operators and Fields**: Operators in the CFT correspond to fields in the AdS space. For instance, a scalar operator \(\mathcal{O}\) in the CFT corresponds to a scalar field \(\phi\) in AdS.

## Mathematical Formalism

### AdS Metric

The metric for AdS\(_{d+1}\) space in Poincaré coordinates is given by:

$$
ds^2 = \frac{L^2}{z^2} \left( -dt^2 + d\vec{x}^2 + dz^2 \right)
$$

where \(L\) is the AdS radius, \(t\) is time, \(\vec{x}\) are the spatial coordinates of the boundary, and \(z\) is the radial coordinate with the boundary located at \(z \to 0\).

### Correlation Functions

For a bulk field \(\phi\) corresponding to a boundary operator \(\mathcal{O}\), the generating functional of the CFT is given by the on-shell action of the bulk theory:

$$
\left\langle \exp \left( \int d^dx \, J(x) \mathcal{O}(x) \right) \right\rangle_{\text{CFT}} = \exp \left( -S_{\text{bulk}}[\phi] \right)
$$

where \(J(x)\) is the source for \(\mathcal{O}(x)\), and \(\phi\) satisfies the bulk equations of motion with boundary condition \(\phi \to J(z \to 0, x)\).

### Scaling Dimensions

The mass \(m\) of a bulk scalar field \(\phi\) is related to the scaling dimension \(\Delta\) of the corresponding boundary operator \(\mathcal{O}\):

$$
\Delta (\Delta - d) = m^2 L^2
$$

## Applications

### Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)

AdS/CFT provides insights into strongly coupled phenomena in QCD, such as confinement and the quark-gluon plasma, using holographic models like AdS/QCD.

### Condensed Matter Physics

The correspondence is used to study strongly correlated systems, including:
- **Non-Fermi Liquids**: Holographic models provide a framework to understand the breakdown of Fermi liquid theory.
- **High-Temperature Superconductors**: Holographic superconductors model the superconducting phase transition using gravity duals.

### Black Hole Physics

AdS/CFT has profound implications for understanding black hole thermodynamics and information paradoxes:
- **Hawking Radiation**: The duality helps study the microscopic origin of black hole entropy.
- **Information Paradox**: Holographic principles contribute to resolving the paradox by suggesting that information is not lost but encoded in Hawking radiation.

### Quantum Gravity

The correspondence provides a non-perturbative definition of quantum gravity in AdS spaces, offering insights into the nature of spacetime and gravity.
