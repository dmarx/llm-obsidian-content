Yes, there are prominent politicians and organizations actively working to promote portable benefits as a way to address the challenges posed by the modern workforce's needs, which could be seen as a step toward broader reforms like universal healthcare.

Senator Mark Warner and Congresswoman Suzan DelBene are key political figures pushing for portable benefits at the federal level. They have introduced legislation such as the Portable Benefits for Independent Workers Pilot Program Act. This act is aimed at creating a system where benefits are tied to the individual rather than the job, providing workers with greater security and flexibility across different employment situations【57†source】.

At the state level, initiatives are also underway. For example, Washington State Representatives Jessyn Farrell and Derek Stanford have introduced similar legislation focused on creating portable benefits systems for independent workers. This kind of state and local activity reflects a growing recognition of the need for benefits systems that accommodate the changing nature of work, which includes increased job switching, freelancing, and gig work【57†source】.

Organizations like the Aspen Institute are also deeply involved in shaping the discourse and development of portable benefits. They provide resources, conduct studies, and facilitate discussions aimed at understanding the best practices and policies that can support the implementation of portable benefits. Their work emphasizes the importance of benefits that are portable, prorated, and universal to adapt to the dynamic labor market【56†source】.

These efforts reflect a significant move toward addressing some of the systemic issues in the employment-benefits linkage by promoting policies that could lead to more comprehensive solutions like universal healthcare in the future.
