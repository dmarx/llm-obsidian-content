Cobordism Theory


**ASSISTANT**

**Cobordism theory** is a fundamental area of algebraic topology that classifies manifolds by studying their relationships through **cobordisms**. Two manifolds are considered cobordant if they can be viewed as the boundaries of a higher-dimensional manifold. This theory provides a way of understanding the topology of manifolds through equivalence classes under cobordism, and it has deep connections with characteristic classes, homotopy theory, and mathematical physics.

### Basic Idea: What is a Cobordism?

Let \( M_1 \) and \( M_2 \) be two closed, \( n \)-dimensional manifolds (without boundary). A **cobordism** between \( M_1 \) and \( M_2 \) is an \( (n+1) \)-dimensional manifold \( W \) with boundary, such that:

$$
\partial W = M_1 \sqcup M_2,
$$

where \( \sqcup \) denotes the disjoint union. In this case, \( W \) is called a **cobordism** between \( M_1 \) and \( M_2 \), and \( M_1 \) and \( M_2 \) are said to be **cobordant**. The manifolds \( M_1 \) and \( M_2 \) can be thought of as the "boundary components" of the higher-dimensional manifold \( W \).

If \( M_1 \) and \( M_2 \) are cobordant, they belong to the same **cobordism class**. The idea of cobordism creates an equivalence relation on the set of \( n \)-dimensional manifolds, where \( M_1 \) and \( M_2 \) are equivalent if there exists a cobordism between them. In formal terms:

$$
M_1 \sim M_2 \quad \text{if there exists a cobordism } W \text{ such that } \partial W = M_1 \sqcup M_2.
$$

### Cobordism Groups

Cobordism theory defines **cobordism groups** by grouping manifolds that are cobordant to each other. These groups are denoted \( \Omega_n \), where \( n \) refers to the dimension of the manifolds. The elements of \( \Omega_n \) are cobordism classes of \( n \)-dimensional manifolds.

- **Addition in Cobordism**: The addition in cobordism groups is defined by the **disjoint union** of manifolds. If \( [M_1] \) and \( [M_2] \) are cobordism classes of two \( n \)-dimensional manifolds \( M_1 \) and \( M_2 \), then their sum is the cobordism class of the disjoint union:

  $$
  [M_1] + [M_2] = [M_1 \sqcup M_2].
  $$

- **Identity Element**: The identity element in \( \Omega_n \) is the cobordism class of the empty manifold, because any manifold \( M \) is cobordant to the empty set through a "cylinder" manifold.

- **Inverse Element**: A manifold \( M \) and its reverse orientation \( -M \) are cobordant to the empty set. Thus, the inverse of \( [M] \) is \( [-M] \), the cobordism class of \( M \) with its orientation reversed.

The cobordism groups \( \Omega_n \) are **abelian groups** under these operations.

### Oriented Cobordism and Other Variants

There are different kinds of cobordism depending on the structure of the manifolds involved:

1. **Oriented Cobordism** \( \Omega_n^{\text{SO}} \): In this setting, the manifolds must be **oriented**, and cobordism is required to respect the orientation. Two oriented manifolds \( M_1 \) and \( M_2 \) are oriented-cobordant if there is an oriented cobordism between them.

2. **Unoriented Cobordism** \( \Omega_n \): In the unoriented case, the manifolds do not have any orientation, and cobordism is considered without regard to orientation.

3. **Spin Cobordism** \( \Omega_n^{\text{Spin}} \): This is a refined version where the manifolds must have a **spin structure**, which is an additional geometric structure allowing the definition of [[spinor fields]].

4. **Complex Cobordism** \( \Omega_n^{\text{U}} \): For complex cobordism, the manifolds involved must have a **complex structure** on their tangent bundles. This is a more specialized type of cobordism, important in algebraic geometry and homotopy theory.

Each of these cobordism theories gives rise to a sequence of cobordism groups, and they form different **cobordism rings** under the operations of disjoint union and Cartesian product.

### Thom's Theorem and Cobordism Classes

One of the central results in cobordism theory is **Thom's Theorem**, which provides a way to compute cobordism groups using **[[stable homotopy theory]]**. It states that the cobordism classes of manifolds correspond to the **homotopy classes** of maps into a certain classifying space called the **Thom space**.

In particular, Thom's theorem shows that cobordism groups are related to **homology** and **cohomology** theories. This leads to the classification of cobordism classes via characteristic classes, such as **Stiefel-Whitney classes**, **Pontryagin classes**, and **Chern classes**. These characteristic classes provide invariants that allow one to distinguish between different cobordism classes of manifolds.

### Cobordism and Characteristic Classes

Characteristic classes play a key role in cobordism theory by providing invariants that distinguish cobordism classes of manifolds:

- **Stiefel-Whitney Classes**: In **unoriented cobordism**, the Stiefel-Whitney classes of a manifold serve as invariants. Two manifolds that have the same Stiefel-Whitney classes in cohomology are cobordant.

- **Pontryagin Classes and \( \hat{A} \)-Genus**: In **spin cobordism**, Pontryagin classes and the \( \hat{A} \)-genus are important invariants. The Atiyah-Singer Index Theorem shows that the index of the Dirac operator on a spin manifold is related to the \( \hat{A} \)-genus, and spin cobordism classes are distinguished using these invariants.

- **Chern Classes**: In **complex cobordism**, the Chern classes of a complex manifold serve as important invariants that can distinguish cobordism classes in complex cobordism theory.

### Applications of Cobordism Theory

1. **Classification of Manifolds**: Cobordism theory provides a way to classify manifolds by studying their equivalence classes under cobordism. This classification helps in understanding how manifolds can be embedded in higher-dimensional spaces and how they can be deformed.

2. **Topology and Homotopy Theory**: Cobordism theory has deep connections to **[[stable homotopy theory]]**, and it provides a powerful tool for computing homotopy groups of spheres and other spaces. Thom's work in cobordism theory played a central role in the development of **Thom spectra** in homotopy theory.

3. **Mathematical Physics**: Cobordism theory is used in **quantum field theory** and **string theory**, particularly in the study of **anomalies** and **D-branes**. In these contexts, cobordism invariants help classify the possible topologies of space-time and the structure of field theories.

4. **Index Theory**: In the context of the **Atiyah-Singer Index Theorem**, cobordism plays a role in relating the analytic index of elliptic operators to the topological structure of manifolds. This is particularly important in **[[spin geometry]]**, where the index of the Dirac operator is used to study the geometry and topology of spin manifolds.

### Summary

**Cobordism theory** is a framework for classifying manifolds by their relationships via cobordisms, where two manifolds are cobordant if they can be viewed as the boundaries of a higher-dimensional manifold. Cobordism classes form abelian groups, and these groups can be computed using tools from homotopy theory and characteristic classes. Variants of cobordism, such as **oriented cobordism**, **spin cobordism**, and **complex cobordism**, allow for the classification of manifolds with additional structures.

Cobordism theory has profound applications in topology, geometry, and mathematical physics, providing insights into the structure of manifolds, their embeddings, and their relations to quantum field theory.
