### Multi-Input, Multi-Output (MIMO) Systems

Multi-Input, Multi-Output (MIMO) systems are control systems with multiple inputs and multiple outputs. These systems are prevalent in many engineering fields, including aerospace, robotics, and [[process control]]. The state-space representation is particularly powerful for MIMO systems, providing a structured framework to model and control such systems.

### State-Space Representation of MIMO Systems

The state-space representation of a MIMO system is similar to that of Single-Input, Single-Output (SISO) systems but with vectors and matrices to account for the multiple inputs and outputs.

#### General Form

For a linear time-invariant (LTI) MIMO system, the state-space equations are:

$$
\dot{x}(t) = A x(t) + B u(t),
$$

$$
y(t) = C x(t) + D u(t),
$$

where:
- \( x(t) \) is the state vector (an \( n \times 1 \) vector where \( n \) is the number of states).
- \( u(t) \) is the input vector (a \( p \times 1 \) vector where \( p \) is the number of inputs).
- \( y(t) \) is the output vector (a \( q \times 1 \) vector where \( q \) is the number of outputs).
- \( A \) is the state matrix (an \( n \times n \) matrix).
- \( B \) is the input matrix (an \( n \times p \) matrix).
- \( C \) is the output matrix (a \( q \times n \) matrix).
- \( D \) is the feedthrough (or direct transmission) matrix (a \( q \times p \) matrix).

### Example: Two-Mass, Spring, and Damper System

Consider a mechanical system with two masses connected by springs and dampers, with forces applied to both masses.

#### System Equations

Let:
- \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \) be the displacements of masses \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \).
- \( F_1 \) and \( F_2 \) be the external forces applied to \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \).

The equations of motion are:

$$
m_1 \ddot{x}_1 + b_1 \dot{x}_1 + k_1 x_1 - b_2 (\dot{x}_2 - \dot{x}_1) - k_2 (x_2 - x_1) = F_1,
$$

$$
m_2 \ddot{x}_2 + b_2 (\dot{x}_2 - \dot{x}_1) + k_2 (x_2 - x_1) = F_2.
$$

#### State Variables

Define the state variables as:
- \( x_1 = x_1 \) (displacement of mass \( m_1 \))
- \( x_2 = \dot{x}_1 \) (velocity of mass \( m_1 \))
- \( x_3 = x_2 \) (displacement of mass \( m_2 \))
- \( x_4 = \dot{x}_2 \) (velocity of mass \( m_2 \))

The state vector is:

$$
x = \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \\ x_4 \end{bmatrix}.
$$

#### State-Space Representation

Rewrite the equations of motion in state-space form:

$$
\dot{x}_1 = x_2,
$$

$$
\dot{x}_2 = \frac{1}{m_1} \left( - (b_1 + b_2) x_2 - (k_1 + k_2) x_1 + b_2 x_4 + k_2 x_3 + F_1 \right),
$$

$$
\dot{x}_3 = x_4,
$$

$$
\dot{x}_4 = \frac{1}{m_2} \left( b_2 x_2 + k_2 x_1 - b_2 x_4 - k_2 x_3 + F_2 \right).
$$

In matrix form, these equations are:

$$
\dot{x}(t) = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 
-\frac{k_1 + k_2}{m_1} & -\frac{b_1 + b_2}{m_1} & \frac{k_2}{m_1} & \frac{b_2}{m_1} \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
\frac{k_2}{m_2} & \frac{b_2}{m_2} & -\frac{k_2}{m_2} & -\frac{b_2}{m_2} 
\end{bmatrix} x(t) + \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & 0 \\
\frac{1}{m_1} & 0 \\
0 & 0 \\
0 & \frac{1}{m_2}
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} F_1 \\ F_2 \end{bmatrix},
$$

$$
y(t) = \begin{bmatrix} 
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 
\end{bmatrix} x(t).
$$

### Advantages of State-Space Representation for MIMO Systems

1. **Unified Framework**: Provides a consistent framework for modeling, analyzing, and designing MIMO systems.
2. **Time-Domain Analysis**: Describes the system's behavior in the time domain, facilitating time-domain simulations and analyses.
3. **Flexibility**: Easily accommodates multiple inputs and outputs, internal states, and interconnections.
4. **Modern Control Techniques**: Supports advanced control design methods like state feedback, observers, optimal control, and robust control.

### Control Design for MIMO Systems

#### State Feedback Control

Design a state feedback controller to place the closed-loop poles in desired locations. The control law is:

$$
u(t) = -K x(t) + r(t),
$$

where \( K \) is the state feedback gain matrix, and \( r(t) \) is the reference input.

#### Observer Design

Design an observer to estimate the state variables if they are not all measurable. The observer is:

$$
\dot{\hat{x}}(t) = A \hat{x}(t) + B u(t) + L (y(t) - C \hat{x}(t)),
$$

where \( \hat{x}(t) \) is the estimated state vector, and \( L \) is the observer gain matrix.

### Example: State Feedback Control for MIMO System

Consider the two-mass, spring, and damper system described earlier.

#### Desired Pole Locations

Assume we want to place the closed-loop poles at \(-1 \pm j, -2, -3\).

#### Compute Feedback Gain Matrix \( K \)

Use [[pole placement]] techniques to compute \( K \):

```matlab
A = [0 1 0 0; -((k1+k2)/m1) -((b1+b2)/m1) (k2/m1) (b2/m1); 0 0 0 1; (k2/m2) (b2/m2) -(k2/m2) -(b2/m2)];
B = [0 0; 1/m1 0; 0 0; 0 1/m2];
desired_poles = [-1+1j, -1-1j, -2, -3];
K = place(A, B, desired_poles);
disp('State feedback gain matrix K:');
disp(K);
```

#### Design Observer

Assume we want the observer poles to be at \(-5, -6, -7, -8\):

```matlab
C = [1 0 0 0; 0 0 1 0];
desired_observer_poles = [-5, -6, -7, -8];
L = place(A', C', desired_observer_poles)';
disp('Observer gain matrix L:');
disp(L);
```

### Conclusion

State-space representation provides a powerful and flexible framework for modeling and controlling MIMO systems. It facilitates the design of state feedback controllers and observers, enabling precise control over system dynamics and performance.
