### Theory of Martingales

Martingales are a fundamental concept in probability theory and stochastic processes, with significant applications in various fields, including finance, statistics, and [[gambling theory]]. A martingale is a model of a fair game where the future expected value, given the past, is equal to the present value.

### Definition of a Martingale

Let \((\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)\) be a probability space, and let \(\{\mathcal{F}_t\}_{t \geq 0}\) be a filtration, which is a non-decreasing family of sub-\(\sigma\)-algebras of \(\mathcal{F}\). A stochastic process \(\{M_t\}_{t \geq 0}\) is a martingale with respect to the filtration \(\{\mathcal{F}_t\}\) if it satisfies the following conditions:

1. **Adaptedness**: \(M_t\) is \(\mathcal{F}_t\)-measurable for all \(t \geq 0\).
2. **Integrability**: \(E[|M_t|] < \infty\) for all \(t \geq 0\).
3. **Martingale Property**: For all \(s \leq t\),
   \[
   E[M_t \mid \mathcal{F}_s] = M_s \quad \text{almost surely}.
   \]

### Types of Martingales

1. **Submartingale**: A process \(\{X_t\}_{t \geq 0}\) is a submartingale if it satisfies:
   \[
   E[X_t \mid \mathcal{F}_s] \geq X_s \quad \text{almost surely for all } s \leq t.
   \]

2. **Supermartingale**: A process \(\{Y_t\}_{t \geq 0}\) is a supermartingale if it satisfies:
   \[
   E[Y_t \mid \mathcal{F}_s] \leq Y_s \quad \text{almost surely for all } s \leq t.
   \]

### Examples of Martingales

1. **Simple Symmetric Random Walk**: Consider a simple symmetric random walk \(\{S_n\}\) where \(S_n = \sum_{i=1}^n X_i\) and \(X_i\) are i.i.d. random variables taking values \(\pm 1\) with equal probability. The process \(S_n\) is a martingale with respect to the natural filtration \(\mathcal{F}_n = \sigma(X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n)\).

2. **Brownian Motion**: Standard Brownian motion \(\{W_t\}_{t \geq 0}\) is a martingale with respect to its natural filtration \(\{\mathcal{F}_t\}_{t \geq 0}\), where \(\mathcal{F}_t = \sigma(W_s : 0 \leq s \leq t)\).

### Fundamental Theorems and Properties

#### 1. **Doob's Martingale Convergence Theorem**

Let \(\{M_t\}\) be a non-negative submartingale or a martingale that is uniformly integrable. Then, there exists a random variable \(M_\infty\) such that:

\[
M_t \to M_\infty \quad \text{almost surely and in } L^1 \text{ as } t \to \infty.
\]

#### 2. **Optional Stopping Theorem**

If \(\{M_t\}\) is a martingale and \(\tau\) is a stopping time with respect to the filtration \(\{\mathcal{F}_t\}\), under certain conditions (e.g., bounded \(\tau\)), we have:

\[
E[M_\tau] = E[M_0].
\]

#### 3. **Doob's Decomposition Theorem**

Any submartingale \(\{X_t\}\) can be uniquely decomposed as:

\[
X_t = M_t + A_t,
\]

where \(\{M_t\}\) is a martingale and \(\{A_t\}\) is a predictable, non-decreasing process.

#### 4. **Martingale Representation Theorem**

Let \(\{W_t\}\) be a standard Brownian motion and \(\{M_t\}\) a square-integrable martingale with respect to the filtration generated by \(W_t\). Then, there exists a predictable process \(\phi_t\) such that:

\[
M_t = M_0 + \int_0^t \phi_s \, dW_s.
\]

#### 5. **Doob's Maximal Inequality**

For a non-negative submartingale \(\{X_t\}\) and any \(\lambda > 0\):

\[
P\left(\sup_{0 \leq s \leq t} X_s \geq \lambda\right) \leq \frac{E[X_t]}{\lambda}.
\]

### Applications

#### 1. **Financial Mathematics**

Martingales are used extensively in financial mathematics, particularly in the pricing and hedging of derivatives. The fundamental theorem of asset pricing states that a financial market is arbitrage-free if and only if there exists an equivalent martingale measure under which discounted asset prices are [[martingales]].

#### 2. **Gambling Theory**

Martingales model fair games, where the expected future value of a gambler's capital, given the current capital and past history, is equal to the present capital. This concept underpins the analysis of various betting strategies and their effectiveness.

#### 3. **Stochastic Processes**

Martingales play a central role in the theory of stochastic processes, providing a framework for understanding the behavior of a wide range of random processes. They are used in the study of Brownian motion, random walks, and other processes with applications in fields such as physics, biology, and economics.

### Example: Martingale in Option Pricing

Consider a stock price \(S_t\) following the SDE:

\[
dS_t = \mu S_t \, dt + \sigma S_t \, dW_t,
\]

where \(W_t\) is a standard Brownian motion under the real-world measure. To price a European call option, we move to the risk-neutral measure \(Q\) where the stock price dynamics become:

\[
dS_t = r S_t \, dt + \sigma S_t \, dW_t^Q,
\]

with \(r\) as the risk-free rate. Under the risk-neutral measure, the discounted stock price \(\hat{S}_t = e^{-rt} S_t\) is a martingale. This property is used to derive the Black-Scholes formula for option pricing.

### Conclusion

The theory of [[martingales]] provides a powerful and flexible framework for modeling and analyzing stochastic processes. With fundamental results such as Doob's Decomposition Theorem, the Martingale Representation Theorem, and the Optional Stopping Theorem, [[martingales]] have become indispensable tools in probability theory, financial mathematics, and many other fields. Understanding [[martingales]] and their properties is essential for anyone working with stochastic models and their applications.
