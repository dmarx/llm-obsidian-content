Jukes-Cantor model


**ASSISTANT**

The **Jukes-Cantor model** is one of the simplest models in [[molecular evolution]] used to describe how DNA sequences evolve over time due to random mutations. It is a **substitution model**, specifically a **nucleotide substitution model**, that assumes all types of nucleotide changes (substitutions between adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T)) occur at the same rate.

The model was developed by [[Thom Jukes]] and [[Charles Cantor]] in 1969 and serves as a foundational model in **phylogenetics** and **sequence evolution**. Despite its simplicity, it provides a basis for understanding how DNA sequences evolve and how to infer evolutionary relationships from genetic data.

### Key Assumptions of the Jukes-Cantor Model

1. **Equal Substitution Rates**: The Jukes-Cantor model assumes that all nucleotide substitutions (A ↔ C, A ↔ G, A ↔ T, C ↔ G, C ↔ T, G ↔ T) occur at the same rate, denoted by \( \alpha \). This is called the **equal rates assumption**.
   
2. **Equal Base Frequencies**: The model assumes that each nucleotide (A, C, G, T) is equally likely to appear in the sequence over long evolutionary timescales, meaning the equilibrium frequencies of all four bases are equal and are each \( 0.25 \).

3. **Markov Process**: The substitution of nucleotides follows a **Markov process**, meaning that the future state of a nucleotide (whether it mutates to another nucleotide) depends only on its current state and not on its past history.

4. **Constant Substitution Rate**: The substitution rate \( \alpha \) is constant over time and across all sites in the DNA sequence.

### Transition Matrix of the Jukes-Cantor Model

The Jukes-Cantor model can be expressed as a **continuous-time Markov chain**, where the probability of a nucleotide changing into another over time is described by a transition matrix. Let \( P(t) \) be the **transition probability matrix** at time \( t \), where each entry \( P_{ij}(t) \) represents the probability that nucleotide \( i \) mutates into nucleotide \( j \) after time \( t \).

The Jukes-Cantor substitution matrix is given by:
$$
P(t) = \begin{pmatrix}
P_{AA}(t) & P_{AC}(t) & P_{AG}(t) & P_{AT}(t) \\
P_{CA}(t) & P_{CC}(t) & P_{CG}(t) & P_{CT}(t) \\
P_{GA}(t) & P_{GC}(t) & P_{GG}(t) & P_{GT}(t) \\
P_{TA}(t) & P_{TC}(t) & P_{TG}(t) & P_{TT}(t) \\
\end{pmatrix}
$$
where \( P_{ij}(t) \) represents the probability that nucleotide \( i \) is replaced by nucleotide \( j \) after time \( t \).

Given the assumptions of the Jukes-Cantor model, the transition probabilities can be computed as:
- The probability that a nucleotide remains unchanged after time \( t \):
  $$
  P_{ii}(t) = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{3}{4} e^{-4\alpha t}
  $$
- The probability that a nucleotide mutates into any of the other three nucleotides:
  $$
  P_{ij}(t) = \frac{1}{4} \left( 1 - e^{-4\alpha t} \right) \quad \text{for } i \neq j
  $$

Here, \( \alpha \) is the rate of substitution between any pair of nucleotides, and \( t \) represents evolutionary time.

### Derivation and Key Formula

The Jukes-Cantor model assumes that, over an infinitesimally small time step \( \Delta t \), the probability of a nucleotide changing is proportional to \( \alpha \Delta t \), and the probability that the nucleotide remains unchanged is \( 1 - 3\alpha \Delta t \), since it could mutate into any of the other three nucleotides with equal probability.

The **rate matrix** \( Q \), which defines the rates of change from one nucleotide to another, is:
$$
Q = \begin{pmatrix}
-3\alpha & \alpha & \alpha & \alpha \\
\alpha & -3\alpha & \alpha & \alpha \\
\alpha & \alpha & -3\alpha & \alpha \\
\alpha & \alpha & \alpha & -3\alpha \\
\end{pmatrix}
$$

The matrix \( P(t) \) can be computed by exponentiating the rate matrix:
$$
P(t) = e^{Qt}
$$

Using this approach, we arrive at the earlier transition probabilities, which describe the likelihood of each nucleotide remaining unchanged or mutating into another nucleotide over time.

### Estimating Evolutionary Distances

One of the primary uses of the Jukes-Cantor model is to estimate **evolutionary distances** between sequences, typically measured as the number of substitutions per site. If we observe two DNA sequences and compute the proportion of sites where the nucleotides differ, denoted by \( p \), we can use the Jukes-Cantor model to estimate the evolutionary distance \( d \) (in terms of substitutions per site).

The **Jukes-Cantor correction** for the observed proportion of differences \( p \) is:
$$
d = -\frac{3}{4} \ln \left( 1 - \frac{4}{3} p \right)
$$

This formula corrects for the fact that observed differences \( p \) underestimate the true number of substitutions, as some positions may have undergone multiple changes (hidden substitutions). The factor \( \frac{3}{4} \) accounts for the model's assumption of equal mutation probabilities among the four nucleotides.

### Properties of the Jukes-Cantor Model

1. **Symmetry**: Since all nucleotide substitutions occur at the same rate, the Jukes-Cantor model is fully symmetric. This implies that any nucleotide is equally likely to mutate into any other nucleotide.
   
2. **Homogeneity**: The model assumes that substitution rates are the same across all sites and constant over time, making it **homogeneous** in both time and space.

3. **Equilibrium Distribution**: Over a long time, the nucleotide frequencies in the population will reach equilibrium, where each nucleotide appears with equal probability (25% for A, C, G, and T). This reflects the equal base frequency assumption of the model.

### Limitations of the Jukes-Cantor Model

Despite its simplicity, the Jukes-Cantor model has several limitations:
- **Equal Substitution Rates**: The model assumes that all types of substitutions occur at the same rate, which is unrealistic for most biological systems. For example, transitions (substitutions between purines A ↔ G or pyrimidines C ↔ T) generally occur more frequently than transversions (substitutions between purines and pyrimidines).
  
- **Equal Base Frequencies**: The assumption of equal base frequencies may not hold in real data, as many genomes have biased nucleotide compositions.

- **No Heterogeneity Among Sites**: The Jukes-Cantor model assumes that every site in the sequence evolves at the same rate, but in real genomes, some regions (e.g., coding regions) are more conserved than others (e.g., non-coding regions).

### Extensions of the Jukes-Cantor Model

Several more complex substitution models have been developed to address the limitations of the Jukes-Cantor model. These models introduce more realistic assumptions about the rates of different types of substitutions and nucleotide frequencies:
- **Kimura 2-Parameter (K2P) Model**: Introduces separate rates for **transitions** and **transversions**, recognizing that transitions generally occur more frequently than transversions.
- **HKY Model (Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano)**: Generalizes the K2P model by allowing unequal base frequencies.
- **General Time Reversible (GTR) Model**: The most general commonly used substitution model, allowing different rates for each of the six possible nucleotide substitutions and different base frequencies.

### Applications of the Jukes-Cantor Model

1. **Phylogenetic Inference**: The Jukes-Cantor model is used to estimate evolutionary distances between sequences and infer **phylogenetic trees**. By applying the Jukes-Cantor correction to pairwise differences between sequences, we can construct distance matrices that form the basis for tree-building methods like **neighbor-joining** or **UPGMA**.

2. **Molecular Evolution Studies**: The Jukes-Cantor model provides a basic framework for studying [[molecular evolution]] by modeling how nucleotide sequences change over time.

3. **DNA Sequence Alignment**: In sequence alignment and homology detection, the Jukes-Cantor model helps correct for multiple substitutions, improving the accuracy of sequence comparisons.

### Conclusion

The **Jukes-Cantor model** is a fundamental substitution model in [[molecular evolution]], providing a simple yet powerful way to describe the stochastic process of DNA sequence evolution. Despite its limitations, it serves as a foundation for more complex models and is widely used in phylogenetics and evolutionary biology. Its simplicity makes it an important starting point for understanding the dynamics of nucleotide substitution and the estimation
