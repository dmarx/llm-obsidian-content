the Principal Principle


**ASSISTANT**

The Principal Principle (PP), introduced by David Lewis in his 1980 paper "A Subjectivist's Guide to Objective Chance," is a philosophical principle that aims to bridge the gap between subjective probability (credence) and objective probability (chance). The principle provides a way to align an individual's rational degrees of belief with known chances. Here's a detailed explanation of the Principal Principle and its significance:

### The Principal Principle Explained

**Statement of the Principal Principle**: The Principal Principle asserts that if an agent knows the objective chance of a particular event occurring, and has no further information relevant to the event's outcome, then the agent's subjective probability (credence) for the event should match the known objective chance.

Formally, if \( Ch(A) = x \) is the objective chance that event \( A \) occurs, and \( C \) represents the agent's credence function, then the Principal Principle states that:

\[ C(A | Ch(A) = x \land E) = x \]

where:
- \( Ch(A) \) is the objective chance of \( A \),
- \( C(A | Ch(A) = x \land E) \) is the conditional credence of \( A \) given the known chance \( x \) and any additional evidence \( E \),
- \( E \) is any admissible evidence, which means that it does not provide further information about the occurrence of \( A \) beyond what is already encapsulated in the chance \( x \).

### Significance and Implications

1. **Rational Alignment**: The Principal Principle helps ensure that an agent's subjective beliefs are rationally aligned with known objective chances. It provides a normative guideline for how one should update their beliefs upon learning the chances.

2. **Bridge Between Objective and Subjective**: The principle serves as a bridge between objective chance (a property of the world) and subjective credence (an agent's belief). It connects physical probabilities with rational degrees of belief.

3. **Admissibility**: The notion of admissible evidence is crucial. If the evidence \( E \) includes information about the outcome of \( A \) that is not encapsulated in the known chance \( x \), it can affect the agent's credence. The principle only applies when \( E \) is admissible, meaning it does not include such additional information.

### Challenges and Developments

1. **Admissibility Condition**: Determining what constitutes admissible evidence can be challenging. There has been significant debate and analysis regarding what information should be considered admissible when applying the Principal Principle.

2. **The New Principal Principle (NPP)**: Lewis later proposed a revised version of the principle, known as the New Principal Principle, to address certain counterexamples and criticisms. The NPP includes a more refined understanding of admissible evidence.

3. **Undermining Futures**: One of the challenges to the Principal Principle involves scenarios where future events might undermine current chances. These are situations where the future state of the world provides information that can affect current objective chances, complicating the application of the principle.

4. **Humphreys' Paradox**: Another challenge is Humphreys' Paradox, which raises issues about the use of chances to justify beliefs about single-case probabilities. This paradox has led to further discussions about the interpretation and scope of the Principal Principle.

   Jeffrey's work explores various aspects of probability, including the relationship between subjective credence and objective chance, and discusses the Principal Principle in the context of rational belief.

### Conclusion

The Principal Principle is a foundational concept in the philosophy of probability, offering a normative guideline for aligning subjective beliefs with objective chances. It has significant implications for epistemology, decision theory, and the interpretation of probability. Understanding and applying the Principal Principle requires careful consideration of admissible evidence and the context in which chances are known.
