Sylvester's law of inertia

### Sylvester's Law of Inertia

Sylvester's Law of Inertia is a fundamental result in the theory of [[quadratic forms]]. It states that the number of positive, negative, and zero eigenvalues of a real symmetric matrix is invariant under congruent transformations. This implies that for any real symmetric matrix $A$, its inertia (the triple consisting of the count of positive, negative, and zero eigenvalues) is preserved under changes of basis.

#### Formal Statement

Let $A$ be a real symmetric matrix. The **inertia** of $A$ is defined as the triplet $(n_+, n_-, n_0)$ where:
- $n_+$ is the number of positive eigenvalues of $A$,
- $n_-$ is the number of negative eigenvalues of $A$,
- $n_0$ is the number of zero eigenvalues of $A$.

Consider another real symmetric matrix $B$ that is congruent to $A$. This means there exists a nonsingular matrix $P$ such that:
$$
B = P^T A P
$$
Sylvester's Law of Inertia asserts that the inertia of $A$ is the same as the inertia of $B$.

#### Implications

This result has significant implications in various areas of mathematics, especially in the study of [[quadratic forms]] and their classification. It tells us that the signature of a quadratic form (which is directly related to the inertia of its associated matrix) is an intrinsic property that does not change under a suitable change of coordinates.

#### Proof Sketch

1. **Diagonalization via Orthogonal Matrices**: Since $A$ is real and symmetric, it can be diagonalized by an orthogonal matrix $Q$ such that $Q^T A Q = D$ where $D$ is a diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues of $A$.

2. **Congruence Transformation**: Consider the matrix $P = Q \Lambda$ where $\Lambda$ is a nonsingular diagonal matrix. Then:
$$
P^T A P = (Q \Lambda)^T A (Q \Lambda) = \Lambda^T Q^T A Q \Lambda = \Lambda^T D \Lambda
$$
Since $\Lambda$ is diagonal, $\Lambda^T D \Lambda$ retains the eigenvalues of $D$ but possibly scaled. The signs of the eigenvalues, however, remain the same.

3. **Preservation of Signs**: The congruence transformation preserves the number of positive, negative, and zero eigenvalues because the signs of the eigenvalues do not change under scaling by a nonsingular diagonal matrix.

#### Application in Quadratic Forms

For a quadratic form $Q(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{x}^T A \mathbf{x}$ where $A$ is a symmetric matrix:
- The quadratic form can be classified based on the number of positive, negative, and zero coefficients after diagonalization.
- The classification remains invariant under any nonsingular linear transformation of $\mathbf{x}$, as dictated by Sylvester's Law of Inertia.

#### Example

Consider the [[quadratic forms]] defined by matrices:
$$
A = \begin{pmatrix}
2 & 1 \\
1 & 2
\end{pmatrix}, \quad B = \begin{pmatrix}
3 & 0 \\
0 & -1
\end{pmatrix}
$$
Assume $B$ is congruent to $A$. Despite their different appearances, the inertia of both matrices must be identical. 

For $A$, diagonalizing yields eigenvalues $3$ and $1$, indicating inertia $(2, 0, 0)$. Thus, any matrix $B$ congruent to $A$ must have the same inertia, which is indeed $(2, 0, 0)$.
