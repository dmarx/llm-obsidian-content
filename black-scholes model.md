### Black-Scholes Model

The **Black-Scholes Model** is a mathematical model for pricing European-style options, developed by Fischer Black and Myron Scholes in 1973. It provides a closed-form solution for the prices of European call and put options, assuming continuous trading and no arbitrage.

### Key Assumptions

1. **Stock Price Dynamics**: The stock price follows a geometric Brownian motion with constant volatility and drift.
2. **Log-Normal Distribution**: The stock price is log-normally distributed.
3. **No Dividends**: The stock does not pay dividends during the option's life.
4. **Risk-Free Interest Rate**: The risk-free interest rate is constant.
5. **Efficient Markets**: There are no transaction costs or taxes, and it is possible to borrow and lend at the risk-free rate.
6. **Continuous Trading**: The underlying asset can be traded continuously.

### Model Formulation

#### Black-Scholes Partial Differential Equation

The Black-Scholes PDE for an option price \(V(S,t)\) as a function of the stock price \(S\) and time \(t\) is given by:

$$
\frac{\partial V}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 S^2 \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial S^2} + r S \frac{\partial V}{\partial S} - r V = 0
$$

where:
- \( \sigma \) is the volatility of the stock price.
- \( r \) is the risk-free interest rate.

#### European Call Option

A European call option gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying asset at a specified strike price \( K \) at the option's expiration date \( T \).

The Black-Scholes formula for the price \( C \) of a European call option is:

$$
C(S_0, T) = S_0 N(d_1) - K e^{-rT} N(d_2)
$$

where:
- \( S_0 \) is the current stock price.
- \( N(\cdot) \) is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution.
- \( d_1 \) and \( d_2 \) are given by:
  \[
  d_1 = \frac{\ln(S_0 / K) + (r + \sigma^2 / 2) T}{\sigma \sqrt{T}}
  \]
  \[
  d_2 = d_1 - \sigma \sqrt{T}
  \]

#### European Put Option

A European put option gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying asset at a specified strike price \( K \) at the option's expiration date \( T \).

The Black-Scholes formula for the price \( P \) of a European put option is:

$$
P(S_0, T) = K e^{-rT} N(-d_2) - S_0 N(-d_1)
$$

where \( d_1 \) and \( d_2 \) are the same as defined for the call option.

### Derivation and Interpretation

The derivation of the Black-Scholes model involves several steps:

1. **Stochastic Process**: The stock price \( S_t \) is modeled as a geometric Brownian motion:
   \[
   dS_t = \mu S_t dt + \sigma S_t dW_t
   \]
   where \( \mu \) is the drift rate, \( \sigma \) is the volatility, and \( W_t \) is a Wiener process.

2. **Ito's Lemma**: Applying Ito's Lemma to the option price \( V(S,t) \) yields the dynamics of the option price.

3. **Portfolio Construction**: Constructing a risk-free portfolio by taking a position in the stock and the option, and ensuring that the portfolio's value evolves deterministically.

4. **No-Arbitrage Condition**: Using the no-arbitrage principle to derive the Black-Scholes PDE.

### Example Calculation

Consider a European call option with the following parameters:
- Current stock price \( S_0 = 100 \)
- Strike price \( K = 100 \)
- Time to expiration \( T = 1 \) year
- Risk-free interest rate \( r = 0.05 \) (5%)
- Volatility \( \sigma = 0.2 \) (20%)

Calculate \( d_1 \) and \( d_2 \):

$$
d_1 = \frac{\ln(100 / 100) + (0.05 + 0.2^2 / 2) \cdot 1}{0.2 \sqrt{1}} = \frac{0.05 + 0.02}{0.2} = 0.35
$$

$$
d_2 = 0.35 - 0.2 \cdot 1 = 0.15
$$

Using the standard normal cumulative distribution function \( N(\cdot) \):

$$
N(d_1) = N(0.35) \approx 0.6368
$$
$$
N(d_2) = N(0.15) \approx 0.5596
$$

Calculate the call option price \( C \):

$$
C = 100 \cdot 0.6368 - 100 e^{-0.05 \cdot 1} \cdot 0.5596
$$

$$
C = 63.68 - 100 \cdot 0.9512 \cdot 0.5596
$$

$$
C = 63.68 - 53.18 = 10.50
$$

So, the price of the European call option is approximately $10.50.

### Limitations and Extensions

1. **Dividends**: The basic Black-Scholes model does not account for dividend payments. Adjustments can be made for dividend-paying stocks.
2. **Volatility**: Assumes constant volatility, which may not hold in reality. Models such as the Heston model consider stochastic volatility.
3. **American Options**: The Black-Scholes model is not directly applicable to American options due to the early exercise feature. Binomial tree models or finite difference methods are used instead.
4. **Interest Rates**: Assumes constant risk-free interest rates. Extensions consider stochastic interest rates.

### Conclusion

The Black-Scholes model is a foundational tool in financial engineering for pricing European options. Despite its assumptions and limitations, it provides valuable insights into option pricing and has led to further developments in financial mathematics. For more complex situations, such as American options or stochastic volatility, additional models and numerical methods are employed.
