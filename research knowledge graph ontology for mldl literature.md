title: research knowledge graph ontology for mldl literature
---

**USER**

A weakness of modern scientific research practice is that a research paper might contain several related but independent insights, yet we treat the entire paper as either corroborated are deprecated wrt the state of scientific knowledge. I am hoping to construct an ontology which I can use to decompose an article into discrete unkits of knowledge which I can then associate with future research to measure corroboration, deprecate individually if disproven by future research, and combine with additional context to form recommendations. propose a system built around the motivating example of extracting deep learning training recommendations and learning theory insights from research published to arxiv

# Research Knowledge Graph Ontology for ML/DL Literature

## Core Components

### [[Research Atomic Unit]] (RAU)
$\text{RAU} = (C, E, M, R)$ where:
- $C$: Claim/insight
- $E$: Supporting evidence
- $M$: Methodology details
- $R$: Results/metrics

### [[Evidence Relations]]
$\text{ER} = \{+, -, \emptyset\}$ representing:
- Corroboration (+)
- Contradiction (-)
- Independence (∅)

### [[Knowledge State]]
For RAU $r$ and evidence set $E$:
$\text{State}(r) = \text{aggregate}(\{e_i \in E : \text{Related}(e_i, r)\})$

## Implementation Structure

### [[Atomic Decomposition]]
```
Paper → {RAU₁, RAU₂, ..., RAUₙ}
RAUᵢ.type ∈ {
  Theoretical,
  Empirical,
  Methodological,
  Architectural
}
```

### [[Training Recommendation Graph]]
$G = (V, E)$ where:
- $V$: RAUs
- $E$: Dependencies + Evidence relations

### [[Corroboration Tracking]]
For RAU $r$:
$\text{Confidence}(r) = f(\sum_{e \in E} w_e \cdot \text{Evidence}(e, r))$
where $w_e$ represents evidence weight

## Example Applications

1. **[[Hyperparameter Dependencies]]**:
```
RAU₁: BatchSize ∝ LearningRate
RAU₂: BatchSize ∝ LayerCount⁻¹
```

2. **[[Architecture Insights]]**:
```
RAU: AttentionHeads.optimal = f(SequenceLength)
Evidence: {paper₁.results, paper₂.ablation}
```

3. **[[Training Dynamics]]**:
```
RAU: GradientNoise ∝ GeneralizationGap
Context: {BatchSize, Optimizer}
```

## Query Interface
```
q(condition, context) → {
  recommendations: [RAU],
  confidence: float,
  evidence: [Citation]
}
```
