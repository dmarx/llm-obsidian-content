Stiefel-Whitney classes of a manifold


**ASSISTANT**

The **Stiefel-Whitney classes** are topological invariants associated with **real vector bundles** over a manifold, including the **tangent bundle** of the manifold. These classes provide crucial information about the **orientability**, **embeddability**, and other properties of the manifold. In particular, the **second Stiefel-Whitney class** plays a fundamental role in determining whether a manifold admits a **spin structure**.

Stiefel-Whitney classes are part of a broader family of **characteristic classes**, which are cohomological invariants that describe how a vector bundle is "twisted" over a base space, such as a manifold.

### Basic Setup: Vector Bundles

Let \( E \to M \) be a **real vector bundle** over a smooth manifold \( M \), with \( E \) having rank \( n \) (i.e., each fiber is an \( n \)-dimensional real vector space). The **Stiefel-Whitney classes** of \( E \), denoted by \( w_i(E) \), are elements of the cohomology ring of the base manifold \( M \), specifically in the cohomology group \( H^i(M; \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}) \) with **\( \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \)** (mod 2) coefficients. The Stiefel-Whitney classes capture how the bundle \( E \) is globally twisted.

- **\( w_0(E) = 1 \)** is always trivial.
- **\( w_i(E) \in H^i(M; \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}) \)** for \( i = 1, 2, \dots \), and they vanish for \( i > n \), where \( n \) is the rank of the vector bundle.

When \( E \) is the **tangent bundle** \( TM \) of a manifold \( M \), we refer to the Stiefel-Whitney classes of \( TM \) as the **Stiefel-Whitney classes of the manifold** itself. These classes provide insights into the topology of the manifold.

### Stiefel-Whitney Classes: Key Examples and Interpretations

#### 1. First Stiefel-Whitney Class \( w_1(E) \)

The **first Stiefel-Whitney class** \( w_1(E) \in H^1(M; \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}) \) measures the **orientability** of the vector bundle \( E \). In the case where \( E = TM \) (the tangent bundle), \( w_1(M) \) indicates whether the manifold \( M \) is orientable:

- If \( w_1(M) = 0 \), the manifold is **orientable**.
- If \( w_1(M) \neq 0 \), the manifold is **non-orientable**.

For example, the **MÃ¶bius strip** is a non-orientable surface, and its first Stiefel-Whitney class is nonzero.

#### 2. Second Stiefel-Whitney Class \( w_2(E) \)

The **second Stiefel-Whitney class** \( w_2(E) \in H^2(M; \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}) \) provides information about the **spin structure** of the bundle or manifold. Specifically:

- If \( w_2(TM) = 0 \), the manifold admits a **spin structure**, meaning it is possible to define **[[spinor fields]]** and the **Dirac operator** on the manifold.
- If \( w_2(TM) \neq 0 \), the manifold does **not admit a spin structure**.

The second Stiefel-Whitney class is one of the key topological obstructions to defining spin structures. For example, **spheres** \( S^n \) (for \( n > 1 \)) have \( w_2 = 0 \), so they admit spin structures. However, the **real projective plane** \( \mathbb{RP}^2 \) has a nonzero second Stiefel-Whitney class, and thus it does not admit a spin structure.

#### Higher Stiefel-Whitney Classes

- **\( w_n(E) \)**: The **top Stiefel-Whitney class** (where \( n \) is the rank of the bundle) provides information about the **non-triviality** of the bundle. If \( w_n(E) \neq 0 \), the vector bundle is non-trivial in a topological sense.
  
- **\( w_3(E), w_4(E), \dots \)**: These higher Stiefel-Whitney classes give more refined information about the bundle's topology, but they are harder to interpret geometrically. For tangent bundles, these higher classes are connected to deeper properties of the manifold.

### Role of Stiefel-Whitney Classes in Topology

Stiefel-Whitney classes arise naturally in a variety of topological contexts:

- **Embeddings and Immersions**: Stiefel-Whitney classes can provide obstructions to embedding or immersing a manifold into Euclidean space. For example, **Whitney's embedding theorem** provides conditions under which a manifold can be embedded in higher-dimensional Euclidean spaces.

- **Cobordism Theory**: In [[cobordism theory]], Stiefel-Whitney classes are used to classify manifolds based on their cobordism classes, particularly in terms of orientability and spin structures.

- **Homotopy Theory**: Stiefel-Whitney classes are used in studying vector bundles over spheres and other spaces, playing a key role in the classification of bundles and in **K-theory**.

### Summary of Key Points

- **Stiefel-Whitney classes** \( w_i(E) \) are cohomology classes that measure the twisting of a real vector bundle \( E \) over a manifold \( M \). They live in the cohomology groups \( H^i(M; \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}) \), with mod 2 coefficients.
  
- **\( w_1(E) \)** measures **orientability**: A manifold is orientable if \( w_1 = 0 \).
  
- **\( w_2(E) \)** is the **obstruction to a spin structure**: A manifold admits a spin structure if and only if \( w_2 = 0 \).
  
- Higher Stiefel-Whitney classes \( w_i(E) \) provide further topological information about the vector bundle or manifold, related to embeddability and immersions.

Stiefel-Whitney classes are fundamental to the topology of manifolds and vector bundles, and they play a crucial role in the study of **spin geometry**, **index theory**, and other areas of **differential topology**.
