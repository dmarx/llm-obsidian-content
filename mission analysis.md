mission analysis


**ASSISTANT**

**Mission Analysis** is a critical initial step in the military planning process that involves thoroughly understanding and clarifying the mission and its objectives. The purpose of mission analysis is to provide a comprehensive foundation for all subsequent planning activities by ensuring that the entire planning team and all subordinate units fully understand the mission, the commander’s intent, and the key tasks that must be accomplished to achieve the desired end state.

## Objectives of Mission Analysis

1. **Clarify the Mission**: Ensure a shared understanding of the mission's purpose, objectives, and the desired end state. This includes breaking down the mission statement into its fundamental components and identifying the specified and implied tasks that need to be performed.

2. **Understand the Commander’s Intent**: Comprehend the higher commander's intent, which provides guidance on the overall strategic goals, the purpose of the operation, and the desired end state. This helps subordinate commanders make decisions that are consistent with the broader objectives.

3. **Identify Constraints and Limitations**: Determine any constraints (mandates that must be followed) and limitations (restrictions that cannot be violated), such as rules of engagement, resource availability, political considerations, and time constraints.

4. **Assess the Operational Environment**: Analyze the operational environment, including enemy capabilities, terrain, weather, and other factors that could impact the mission. This helps in identifying opportunities and threats that could influence the planning and execution of the mission.

5. **Determine Key Information Requirements**: Identify critical information requirements that are essential for decision-making. This includes the commander’s critical information requirements (CCIRs), which are specific pieces of information required to make informed decisions during the operation.

6. **Prepare for Course of Action (COA) Development**: Establish a solid foundation for developing multiple feasible, acceptable, and suitable COAs by understanding the mission, environment, and available resources.

## Steps in Mission Analysis

### 1. **Review the Mission and Commander’s Intent**

The first step in mission analysis is to review the mission statement and the higher commander’s intent. This involves a careful examination of the mission order or directive received from higher headquarters, which typically includes:

- **Mission Statement**: A concise statement of the “who, what, where, when, and why” of the operation. The mission statement clarifies the unit’s specific task and purpose.

- **Commander’s Intent**: A description of the desired end state and the purpose of the mission. The commander’s intent provides the overall guidance for the operation, allowing subordinates to exercise initiative and make decisions that align with the broader goals.

### 2. **Identify Specified and Implied Tasks**

Tasks in a mission are categorized as either **specified** or **implied**:

- **Specified Tasks**: Tasks explicitly stated in the mission order. These are the direct requirements that the unit must accomplish to fulfill the mission.

- **Implied Tasks**: Tasks that are not explicitly stated but are necessary to accomplish the mission. These tasks are derived from the analysis of the specified tasks, mission statement, and commander’s intent.

#### Example:

For a mission to “seize and hold a bridge,” specified tasks might include “seize the bridge” and “defend the bridge,” while implied tasks could include “conduct reconnaissance of the area” and “establish supply lines to support the operation.”

### 3. **Identify Constraints and Limitations**

During mission analysis, planners identify any **constraints** and **limitations** that could impact the operation:

- **Constraints**: Actions that must be taken or adhered to. For example, a constraint might be that a specific route must be used or a particular unit must be involved in the operation.

- **Limitations**: Actions that cannot be taken. These might include restrictions such as not crossing a particular border, adhering to rules of engagement, or avoiding collateral damage in civilian areas.

#### Examples:

- **Constraint**: Use only specific routes due to terrain or enemy positions.
- **Limitation**: No engagement with enemy forces outside of designated engagement zones due to political considerations.

### 4. **Analyze the Operational Environment**

A thorough analysis of the operational environment helps planners understand how various factors could impact the mission. This includes:

- **Enemy Analysis**: Assessing the enemy’s capabilities, composition, dispositions, and likely [[courses of action]] (COAs). Understanding the enemy’s strengths, weaknesses, and possible intentions helps in anticipating and countering enemy actions.

- **Terrain Analysis**: Evaluating key terrain features, avenues of approach, obstacles, and potential engagement areas. Terrain analysis also considers how the physical environment could affect movement, positioning, and concealment.

- **Weather Analysis**: Understanding how weather conditions (such as visibility, precipitation, wind, and temperature) might impact both friendly and enemy operations. For example, fog could reduce visibility, affecting both aerial and ground operations.

- **Civil Considerations**: Analyzing the impact of civilian presence, infrastructure, and local culture on military operations. This includes assessing how operations might affect civilian populations and how civilian activities might impact military operations.

### 5. **Determine Key Information Requirements**

Identifying **Key Information Requirements (KIRs)** is essential for making informed decisions. These include:

- **Commander’s Critical Information Requirements (CCIRs)**: Information that is critical for decision-making and directly affects mission success. CCIRs typically include **Priority Intelligence Requirements (PIRs)** (information needed to understand the enemy and environment) and **Friendly Force Information Requirements (FFIRs)** (information needed to understand the status of friendly forces).

- **Essential Elements of Friendly Information (EEFI)**: Information that must be protected to prevent the enemy from gaining an advantage.

### 6. **Assess Risks and Develop Risk Mitigation Measures**

Risk assessment is a critical component of mission analysis. Planners identify potential risks that could impact mission success, such as:

- **Enemy Actions**: Risks related to enemy capabilities and likely actions, including surprise attacks, ambushes, or counteroffensives.

- **Environmental Factors**: Risks related to terrain, weather, and other environmental conditions that could hinder movement, communication, or sustainment.

- **Logistical Challenges**: Risks related to the supply and support of forces, including potential supply chain disruptions or shortages of critical resources.

After identifying risks, planners develop mitigation measures to reduce their impact. This might include adjusting plans, allocating additional resources, or developing contingency plans.

### 7. **Develop a Mission Statement**

Based on the analysis, planners refine or develop a **mission statement** that clearly articulates the unit’s purpose and primary tasks. The mission statement should be concise and easily understood by all members of the unit.

**Example Mission Statement**:

“The battalion will seize and secure Bridge Alpha at coordinates X to enable follow-on forces to cross the river and advance towards Objective Bravo. This operation will commence at 0600 hours and be completed by 1200 hours.”

### 8. **Issue Planning Guidance**

After completing mission analysis, the commander issues **planning guidance** to the staff and subordinate units. This guidance provides direction for the development of COAs and includes:

- **Emphasis on Key Objectives**: Highlighting the most important objectives and tasks that should receive priority in planning.
- **Guidance on Risk**: Providing direction on acceptable levels of risk and risk mitigation measures.
- **Resource Allocation**: Clarifying the allocation of resources, including forces, equipment, and logistics support.
- **Constraints and Limitations**: Reiterating any constraints and limitations that must be adhered to during planning.

### 9. **Prepare for COA Development**

The final step of mission analysis is to prepare for COA development. This involves:

- **Developing Initial Planning Assumptions**: Assumptions about the enemy, terrain, weather, and other factors that are necessary for planning but cannot be confirmed until later.
- **Organizing Planning Teams**: Ensuring that the right personnel and resources are in place to develop and evaluate multiple COAs.
- **Gathering Additional Information**: Identifying any gaps in information that need to be addressed before proceeding with COA development.

## Tools and Techniques Used in Mission Analysis

### 1. **METT-TC Analysis**

**METT-TC** stands for **Mission, Enemy, Terrain and weather, Troops and support available, Time available, and Civil considerations**. It is a mnemonic that helps planners systematically consider all relevant factors when conducting mission analysis.

- **Mission**: Clarifying the mission’s objective and desired end state.
- **Enemy**: Understanding the enemy’s capabilities, composition, and likely COAs.
- **Terrain and Weather**: Analyzing how terrain and weather will impact operations.
- **Troops and Support Available**: Assessing the capabilities and readiness of friendly forces, including support units and logistics.
- **Time Available**: Evaluating how much time is available for planning, preparation, and execution.
- **Civil Considerations**: Considering the impact of civilian factors on the operation.

### 2. **IPB (Intelligence Preparation of the Battlefield)**

IPB is a systematic process to analyze the enemy, terrain, weather, and civil considerations. It involves:

- **Defining the Battlefield Environment**: Determining the geographical area and factors that will affect the operation.
- **Describing the Battlefield’s Effects**: Analyzing how terrain, weather, and other factors will impact operations.
- **Evaluating the Threat**: Assessing the enemy’s capabilities, disposition, and likely COAs.
- **Determining Threat COAs**: Identifying the most likely and most dangerous enemy COAs.

### 3. **SWOT Analysis**

**SWOT Analysis** assesses the **Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats** associated with the mission. It helps identify internal and external factors that could impact the operation.

- **Strengths**: Internal capabilities and advantages that could enhance mission success.
- **Weaknesses**: Internal limitations or
