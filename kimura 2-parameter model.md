Kimura 2-parameter model


**ASSISTANT**

The **Kimura 2-Parameter (K2P) model** is a nucleotide substitution model used in [[molecular evolution]] to describe the rate of nucleotide changes between DNA sequences. It was introduced by [[Motoo Kimura]] in 1980 and is an extension of the simpler [[Jukes-Cantor model]]. Unlike the Jukes-Cantor model, which assumes that all types of nucleotide substitutions occur at the same rate, the Kimura 2-Parameter model distinguishes between two types of substitutions:
- **Transitions**: Substitutions between purines (A ↔ G) or between pyrimidines (C ↔ T).
- **Transversions**: Substitutions between a purine and a pyrimidine (A ↔ C, A ↔ T, G ↔ C, or G ↔ T).

The K2P model assumes that transitions occur at a different rate than transversions, which reflects the biological observation that transitions are generally more frequent than transversions in most DNA sequences.

### Key Features of the Kimura 2-Parameter Model

1. **Different Rates for Transitions and Transversions**: 
   - The K2P model introduces two different substitution rates:
     - \( \alpha \): The rate of **transitions** (A ↔ G or C ↔ T).
     - \( \beta \): The rate of **transversions** (A ↔ C, A ↔ T, G ↔ C, or G ↔ T).

2. **Equal Base Frequencies**: Similar to the Jukes-Cantor model, the K2P model assumes that the four nucleotides (A, C, G, T) occur with equal frequencies in the sequence. This means the equilibrium frequencies of A, C, G, and T are each \( 0.25 \).

3. **Markov Process**: Like other nucleotide substitution models, the K2P model assumes that nucleotide substitutions follow a **Markov process**, where the future state of a nucleotide (whether it mutates to another nucleotide) depends only on its current state and not on its past history.

4. **Constant Substitution Rates**: The model assumes that the rates of transitions and transversions are constant over time and across all sites in the sequence.

### Transition Matrix of the Kimura 2-Parameter Model

In the K2P model, the process of nucleotide substitution over time is governed by a **transition matrix** that describes the probability of changing from one nucleotide to another over time \( t \).

Let \( P(t) \) be the **transition probability matrix**, where each entry \( P_{ij}(t) \) represents the probability that nucleotide \( i \) changes into nucleotide \( j \) after time \( t \). The transition matrix for the K2P model is:

$$
P(t) = \begin{pmatrix}
P_{AA}(t) & P_{AC}(t) & P_{AG}(t) & P_{AT}(t) \\
P_{CA}(t) & P_{CC}(t) & P_{CG}(t) & P_{CT}(t) \\
P_{GA}(t) & P_{GC}(t) & P_{GG}(t) & P_{GT}(t) \\
P_{TA}(t) & P_{TC}(t) & P_{TG}(t) & P_{TT}(t) \\
\end{pmatrix}
$$

For the K2P model, the transition probabilities depend on the rates \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \) and the time \( t \):

- The probability that a nucleotide remains unchanged after time \( t \) (i.e., \( P_{ii}(t) \)):
  $$
  P_{ii}(t) = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} e^{-4\beta t} + \frac{1}{4} e^{-2(\alpha + \beta)t}
  $$
  
- The probability that a nucleotide undergoes a **transition** (i.e., \( P_{AG}(t) \) or \( P_{CT}(t) \)):
  $$
  P_{\text{transition}}(t) = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} e^{-2(\alpha + \beta)t} - \frac{1}{2} e^{-4\beta t}
  $$

- The probability that a nucleotide undergoes a **transversion** (i.e., \( P_{AC}(t), P_{AT}(t), P_{GC}(t), P_{GT}(t) \)):
  $$
  P_{\text{transversion}}(t) = \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{4} e^{-2(\alpha + \beta)t}
  $$

### Rate Matrix

The **rate matrix** \( Q \), which specifies the instantaneous rates of substitution between nucleotides, is defined based on the two parameters \( \alpha \) (transition rate) and \( \beta \) (transversion rate). The rate matrix for the K2P model is given by:

$$
Q = \begin{pmatrix}
-2\beta - \alpha & \beta & \alpha & \beta \\
\beta & -2\beta - \alpha & \beta & \alpha \\
\alpha & \beta & -2\beta - \alpha & \beta \\
\beta & \alpha & \beta & -2\beta - \alpha
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Each entry \( Q_{ij} \) represents the instantaneous rate of change from nucleotide \( i \) to nucleotide \( j \). The diagonal entries are negative and are chosen so that the rows sum to zero, ensuring that the total probability across all possible substitutions equals 1.

To find the transition matrix \( P(t) \) at any time \( t \), we exponentiate the rate matrix:
$$
P(t) = e^{Qt}
$$

### Estimating Evolutionary Distances with the K2P Model

One of the primary uses of the Kimura 2-Parameter model is to estimate **evolutionary distances** between DNA sequences. The evolutionary distance \( d \), measured in terms of the expected number of substitutions per site, can be estimated from the observed proportion of differences between two sequences.

If we observe two DNA sequences and calculate the **proportion of transitions** \( p_{ts} \) and the **proportion of transversions** \( p_{tv} \), the evolutionary distance \( d \) can be estimated using the following correction formula:

$$
d = -\frac{1}{2} \ln \left( 1 - 2p_{ts} - p_{tv} \right) - \frac{1}{4} \ln \left( 1 - 2p_{tv} \right)
$$

This formula accounts for the fact that observed differences between sequences underestimate the true number of substitutions due to the possibility of multiple substitutions at the same site. The correction is necessary because, over time, some substitutions may be "hidden" by subsequent mutations at the same site.

### Differences Between the Jukes-Cantor and Kimura 2-Parameter Models

- **Jukes-Cantor Model**: The Jukes-Cantor model assumes that all types of nucleotide substitutions (A ↔ C, A ↔ G, A ↔ T, etc.) occur at the same rate. This model is simpler but less biologically realistic because transitions and transversions often occur at different rates in real data.

- **Kimura 2-Parameter Model**: The K2P model introduces two different rates—\( \alpha \) for transitions and \( \beta \) for transversions—which reflects the observed higher frequency of transitions relative to transversions in most organisms. This makes the K2P model more biologically accurate than the Jukes-Cantor model.

### Applications of the Kimura 2-Parameter Model

1. **Phylogenetic Inference**: The K2P model is widely used in **phylogenetic tree construction** because it provides a more realistic description of nucleotide substitution patterns than simpler models like Jukes-Cantor. By accounting for different rates of transitions and transversions, it improves the accuracy of distance-based methods (such as **neighbor-joining**) and **maximum likelihood** approaches.

2. **Molecular Evolution Studies**: The model helps quantify evolutionary distances between DNA sequences, making it a valuable tool for studying rates of [[molecular evolution]] and divergence times between species.

3. **DNA Sequence Alignment**: The K2P model is used in sequence alignment algorithms to score matches and mismatches between DNA sequences, improving the accuracy of homology detection.

### Limitations of the K2P Model

While the Kimura 2-Parameter model is an improvement over simpler models like Jukes-Cantor, it still has several limitations:
- **Equal Base Frequencies**: The K2P model assumes that all nucleotides (A, C, G, T) occur with equal frequency. This assumption is not always realistic for many organisms, especially those with biased base compositions.
  
- **No Rate Variation Among Sites**: The model assumes that every site in the sequence evolves at the same rate. In reality, some sites (such as coding regions or conserved functional elements) may evolve more slowly than others.

- **No Multiple Substitutions**: Like the Jukes-Cantor model, the K2P model assumes that a site undergoes a single substitution at a time. However, in long evolutionary timeframes, a site may experience multiple substitutions, which the model does not explicitly account for.

### Extensions of the K2P Model
