bounding overwatch


**ASSISTANT**

**Bounding overwatch** is a tactical movement technique used by military units to advance or retreat through potentially hostile areas while minimizing exposure to enemy fire. It involves dividing the unit into two or more teams—one team moves forward (bounding), while the other team stays in place to provide cover (overwatch). This leapfrog-like method ensures that at any given time, one part of the unit is stationary, ready to provide suppressive fire or respond to threats, while the other part is on the move.

This tactic is particularly useful in **ambush scenarios** or when navigating through **dangerous or uncertain terrain**, such as areas prone to **Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs)** or sniper fire. By coordinating movement with overwatch, military units reduce the chances of being caught off-guard and increase their ability to respond quickly to an attack.

### How Bounding Overwatch Works

Bounding overwatch typically involves two primary types of movement: **successive bounds** and **alternating bounds**.

#### a. **Successive Bounding Overwatch**
In **successive bounding overwatch**, the moving team bounds forward to a position that is level or slightly ahead of the overwatch team, and then they assume an overwatch position. The overwatch team then bounds forward to a position slightly ahead of the moving team.

- **Steps**:
  1. The **overwatch team** stays in place and provides cover, scanning the area for threats and ready to engage any enemy forces.
  2. The **bounding team** moves forward a short distance to a new covered position.
  3. Once the bounding team is in position, they assume the overwatch role, scanning for threats and providing cover.
  4. The original overwatch team then moves forward to a new position slightly ahead or level with the bounding team.

- **Purpose**: Successive bounding maintains consistent spacing between teams, ensuring that the unit moves forward as a cohesive group without overextending.

#### b. **Alternating Bounding Overwatch**
In **alternating bounding overwatch** (also known as "leapfrogging"), the bounding team moves past the overwatch team to a position farther ahead, after which they assume overwatch. Then the overwatch team moves forward past the new bounding team. This leapfrogging action allows for faster movement while still maintaining the protection of overwatch.

- **Steps**:
  1. The **overwatch team** remains in position, scanning for threats.
  2. The **bounding team** moves past the overwatch team to a new position farther ahead and takes up overwatch.
  3. Once in position, the original overwatch team moves forward past the new overwatch position, alternating roles with each movement.

- **Purpose**: Alternating bounding allows for greater speed of movement by allowing one team to advance farther with each bound. However, the unit may be more spread out than with successive bounding, so this tactic is often used in more secure or open terrain.

### Key Principles of Bounding Overwatch

1. **Cover and Concealment**:
   - Both the bounding and overwatch teams should use natural or man-made cover (e.g., trees, buildings, hills) to protect themselves from enemy observation and fire.
   - **Concealment** is used to hide from enemy sight, while **cover** provides physical protection from bullets, shrapnel, or other hazards.

2. **Communication and Coordination**:
   - Proper communication is essential to ensure the bounding and overwatch teams are synchronized. Both teams must understand when it's time to move and when to stop to take up overwatch.
   - **Hand signals** or **radio communication** are often used to coordinate movement, especially in noisy or chaotic environments.

3. **Constant Vigilance**:
   - The overwatch team continuously scans the area for potential threats, such as ambushes, IEDs, or enemy positions. They are responsible for providing immediate suppressive fire if the bounding team encounters enemy forces.
   - The bounding team moves carefully, using cover and concealment to minimize their exposure to enemy fire. Their movements should be deliberate and swift.

4. **Suppressive Fire**:
   - If enemy contact is made, the overwatch team provides **suppressive fire** to keep the enemy pinned down, allowing the bounding team to move to a safer position or close in on the enemy.
   - The bounding team can also return fire as they move, further suppressing enemy positions.

### Situations Where Bounding Overwatch is Used

Bounding overwatch is used in various situations where there is a high likelihood of encountering enemy forces or ambushes. Key situations include:

#### a. **Moving Through Hostile Terrain**
When advancing through areas that are suspected to be occupied by enemy forces—such as urban environments, forests, or mountainous regions—bounding overwatch allows the unit to advance cautiously while always having one team ready to engage the enemy.

- **Example**: A platoon is moving through a narrow mountain pass where insurgents are known to set up ambushes. The platoon splits into two teams, with one team providing overwatch from an elevated ridge while the other team advances to the next covered position.

#### b. **Crossing Danger Areas**
Danger areas, such as open fields, roads, or rivers, present risks because they lack cover, leaving the unit exposed to enemy fire. Bounding overwatch ensures that at least one team is always prepared to engage any threats while the other crosses the open area.

- **Example**: A patrol needs to cross a road that is visible to potential enemy positions. The overwatch team provides cover from a concealed position while the bounding team sprints across the road. Once the bounding team reaches cover, they provide overwatch for the next team.

#### c. **Reacting to Ambushes**
Bounding overwatch is often used as a reaction to ambushes. If the unit comes under fire, the overwatch team can lay down suppressive fire while the bounding team maneuvers out of the kill zone, or vice versa.

- **Example**: A convoy is ambushed by insurgents using small-arms fire and RPGs. The lead element of the convoy provides suppressive fire while the rest of the unit bounds out of the kill zone in a controlled and coordinated retreat.

#### d. **Assaulting Enemy Positions**
When closing in on a known enemy position, bounding overwatch allows the unit to advance toward the enemy while minimizing the risk of exposure. The overwatch team provides suppressive fire to keep the enemy pinned down while the bounding team moves closer.

- **Example**: During an assault on a fortified position, the first team lays down suppressive fire to keep the enemy in their defensive positions. The second team bounds forward to a closer position, where they prepare for the final assault.

### Advantages of Bounding Overwatch

1. **Increased Safety**:
   - By ensuring that one team is always providing cover, bounding overwatch reduces the likelihood of the entire unit being exposed to enemy fire at once. The overwatch team can engage the enemy immediately if contact is made.

2. **Maintains Momentum**:
   - Bounding overwatch allows units to advance through dangerous areas without needing to halt and assess the situation constantly. By alternating between bounding and overwatch, the unit can maintain its momentum while minimizing exposure.

3. **Flexibility**:
   - Bounding overwatch can be adapted to various terrains and threat environments. In urban areas, teams can use buildings and alleyways for cover, while in rural areas, teams use natural features like trees or hills to remain concealed.

4. **Quick Response to Threats**:
   - Since the overwatch team is stationary and focused on scanning for threats, they can respond quickly if an enemy appears or if the bounding team is ambushed. This prevents the entire unit from being caught off guard.

### Disadvantages and Limitations

1. **Slower Movement**:
   - While bounding overwatch provides enhanced protection, it significantly slows down the unit's overall speed of movement compared to traveling in a single formation. This can be a disadvantage in situations where speed is critical.

2. **Communication Challenges**:
   - Maintaining constant communication between bounding and overwatch teams is essential for successful execution, but this can be challenging in noisy or disrupted environments, especially if radio communication is compromised.

3. **Vulnerability During Transition**:
   - During the transition from bounding to overwatch, the bounding team is vulnerable while moving. If the overwatch team fails to detect threats, the moving team can be caught in the open without cover.

4. **Terrain-Dependent**:
   - Bounding overwatch relies on the availability of cover and concealment. In wide-open terrain without adequate cover, it becomes more difficult to execute the tactic effectively.

### Conclusion

**Bounding overwatch** is an essential tactical movement technique for military units operating in high-threat environments. By alternating between moving and providing cover, units can advance cautiously through hostile terrain while maintaining the ability to respond to enemy fire. This technique is crucial for navigating ambushes, crossing danger areas, and closing in on enemy positions while minimizing the risk of casualties. However, it requires careful coordination, communication, and awareness of the surrounding terrain to be effective.
