### Quantal Response Equilibrium (QRE)

**Quantal Response Equilibrium (QRE)** is a refinement of the Nash equilibrium concept in game theory that accounts for [[bounded rationality]] by allowing players to make probabilistic rather than purely deterministic choices. In QRE, players are not assumed to always play their best response with certainty. Instead, they respond to strategies with a probability that increases with the expected utility of those strategies.

### Key Concepts

1. **Probabilistic Choice**: Unlike in Nash equilibrium, where players choose their best response with certainty, in QRE, the probability of choosing a particular strategy increases with its expected utility.
2. **Logit QRE**: A common specification of QRE where the probability of a player choosing a strategy follows a logistic distribution.
3. **Sensitivity Parameter ($\lambda$)**: Reflects the level of rationality. A higher $\lambda$ indicates more rational behavior (choices closer to best response), while $\lambda = 0$ corresponds to completely random behavior.

### Mathematical Formulation

In a typical two-player game with players $i$ and $j$, let $S_i$ and $S_j$ be the strategy sets for players $i$ and $j$, respectively. The utility for player $i$ choosing strategy $s_i$ when player $j$ chooses strategy $s_j$ is $U_i(s_i, s_j)$.

#### Logit QRE

The probability that player $i$ chooses strategy $s_i$ is given by:

$$
P_i(s_i) = \frac{\exp(\lambda \cdot U_i(s_i, \mathbf{P}_{-i}))}{\sum_{s_i' \in S_i} \exp(\lambda \cdot U_i(s_i', \mathbf{P}_{-i}))}
$$

where:
- $\mathbf{P}_{-i}$ is the vector of mixed strategies of the opponents.
- $\lambda$ is the sensitivity parameter.

#### Mixed Strategies and Expected Utility

In QRE, each player's strategy is a mixed strategy, which is a probability distribution over their pure strategies. The expected utility for player $i$ choosing strategy $s_i$ is:

$$
U_i(s_i, \mathbf{P}_{-i}) = \sum_{s_{-i} \in S_{-i}} P_{-i}(s_{-i}) \cdot u_i(s_i, s_{-i})
$$

where $u_i(s_i, s_{-i})$ is the payoff for player $i$ given strategies $s_i$ and $s_{-i}$, and $P_{-i}(s_{-i})$ is the probability that the opponents choose strategy $s_{-i}$.

### Example

Consider a simple two-player game where each player can choose strategy $A$ or $B$. The payoffs are given by the following matrix:

|          | **Player 2: A** | **Player 2: B** |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Player 1: A** | $(3, 3)$         | $(0, 5)$         |
| **Player 1: B** | $(5, 0)$         | $(1, 1)$         |

#### Expected Utility

For Player 1, the expected utility of choosing $A$ is:

$$
U_1(A, P_2) = 3 \cdot P_2(A) + 0 \cdot P_2(B) = 3P_2(A)
$$

For choosing $B$:

$$
U_1(B, P_2) = 5 \cdot P_2(B) + 1 \cdot P_2(A) = 5P_2(B) + P_2(A)
$$

For Player 2, the expected utility of choosing $A$ is:

$$
U_2(A, P_1) = 3 \cdot P_1(A) + 5 \cdot P_1(B) = 3P_1(A) + 5P_1(B)
$$

For choosing $B$:

$$
U_2(B, P_1) = 0 \cdot P_1(A) + 1 \cdot P_1(B) = P_1(B)
$$

#### Logit QRE Probabilities

The probabilities for Player 1 are:

$$
P_1(A) = \frac{\exp(\lambda \cdot 3P_2(A))}{\exp(\lambda \cdot 3P_2(A)) + \exp(\lambda \cdot (5P_2(B) + P_2(A)))}
$$

$$
P_1(B) = \frac{\exp(\lambda \cdot (5P_2(B) + P_2(A)))}{\exp(\lambda \cdot 3P_2(A)) + \exp(\lambda \cdot (5P_2(B) + P_2(A)))}
$$

The probabilities for Player 2 are:

$$
P_2(A) = \frac{\exp(\lambda \cdot (3P_1(A) + 5P_1(B)))}{\exp(\lambda \cdot (3P_1(A) + 5P_1(B))) + \exp(\lambda \cdot P_1(B))}
$$

$$
P_2(B) = \frac{\exp(\lambda \cdot P_1(B))}{\exp(\lambda \cdot (3P_1(A) + 5P_1(B))) + \exp(\lambda \cdot P_1(B))}
$$

### Interpretation

- **Low $\lambda$**: Players choose strategies almost randomly, with little consideration of payoffs.
- **High $\lambda$**: Players choose strategies closer to the best response, aligning more with traditional Nash equilibrium.

### Applications and Implications

1. **Predicting Behavior**: QRE provides more accurate predictions of player behavior in experiments and real-world scenarios than traditional Nash equilibrium, especially when players exhibit [[bounded rationality]].
2. **Policy Design**: Understanding how players might probabilistically respond to incentives can inform the design of policies and mechanisms in economics, political science, and other fields.
3. **Experimental Validation**: QRE can be validated and refined through experimental data, making it a useful tool for empirical research.

### Conclusion

Quantal Response Equilibrium offers a nuanced approach to modeling strategic interactions by incorporating [[bounded rationality]] and probabilistic choice. It bridges the gap between purely rational models and observed human behavior, providing valuable insights for both theoretical analysis and practical applications.
