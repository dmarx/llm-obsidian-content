# Situated Agency

[[Situated Agency]] refers to a theory of action and cognition that emphasizes how an agent's capacity to act intelligently is fundamentally grounded in and shaped by its physical, social, and cultural environment. This perspective stands in contrast to classical models of agency that treat cognition as abstract symbol manipulation detached from embodied experience.

## Mathematical Formalization

We can formalize situated agency as a dynamical system with coupled agent-environment dynamics:

$$\frac{d}{dt} \begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{x}_a \\ \mathbf{x}_e \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} f_a(\mathbf{x}_a, \mathbf{x}_e) \\ f_e(\mathbf{x}_e, \mathbf{x}_a) \end{pmatrix}$$

Where:
- $\mathbf{x}_a \in \mathcal{X}_a$ represents the agent state
- $\mathbf{x}_e \in \mathcal{X}_e$ represents the environment state
- $f_a$ and $f_e$ are the dynamics functions for agent and environment

This coupling creates a [[structural entanglement]] between agent and environment that cannot be fully decomposed.

## Information-Theoretic Perspective

From an information-theoretic standpoint, situated agency involves ongoing information exchange:

$$I(A_{t+1}; E_t | A_t) > 0 \quad \text{and} \quad I(E_{t+1}; A_t | E_t) > 0$$

Where:
- $I(\cdot; \cdot | \cdot)$ represents conditional mutual information
- $A_t$ and $E_t$ are random variables representing agent and environment states at time $t$

This bidirectional information flow creates what [[James J. Gibson]] termed [[affordances]] – possibilities for action that the environment offers the agent.

## Embodied Cognition

Situated agency implies [[embodied cognition]], where the agent's physical form shapes its cognitive processes:

$$\phi: S \times B \times E \rightarrow A$$

Where:
- $S$ represents sensory capabilities
- $B$ represents bodily structure and dynamics
- $E$ represents environmental properties
- $A$ represents possible actions
- $\phi$ is the mapping from situated embodiment to action possibilities

This formulation emphasizes that cognition is not merely computation but is fundamentally shaped by the agent's embodiment.

## Extended Mind Thesis

The [[extended mind thesis]] (Clark & Chalmers, 1998) suggests that cognitive processes extend beyond the traditional boundaries of brain and body to include environmental resources:

$$C = \{I_b \cup I_e | I_b \text{ and } I_e \text{ are integrated through reliable coupling}\}$$

Where:
- $C$ represents the complete cognitive system
- $I_b$ represents internal (brain-bound) information processes
- $I_e$ represents external information processes

## Ecological Psychology Perspective

In [[ecological psychology]], situated agency emerges from direct perception-action coupling:

$$\mathbf{a}_t = f(\tau(\mathbf{s}_t))$$

Where:
- $\mathbf{a}_t$ is the action at time $t$
- $\mathbf{s}_t$ is the sensory input at time $t$
- $\tau$ represents [[invariant detection]] – the extraction of action-relevant patterns
- $f$ is a direct mapping from invariants to actions

This contrasts with representational theories where perception feeds into an internal model that then generates actions.

## Enactive Approach

The [[enactive approach]] (Varela, Thompson, & Rosch) emphasizes that cognition is fundamentally action-oriented:

$$\text{Cognition} = \text{Enaction} = \{(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{a}) | \mathbf{x} \in P, \mathbf{a} \in A(\mathbf{x})\}$$

Where:
- $P$ is the set of possible perceptual states
- $A(\mathbf{x})$ is the set of possible actions given perceptual state $\mathbf{x}$

## Socio-cultural Situation

Agency is also situated within socio-cultural contexts that shape action possibilities:

$$\mathcal{A}(i, c, t) = \{\mathbf{a} | \mathbf{a} \in \mathcal{P}(i, c, t) \cap \mathcal{N}(c, t) \cap \mathcal{C}(i, t)\}$$

Where:
- $\mathcal{A}(i, c, t)$ is the action space for individual $i$ in culture $c$ at time $t$
- $\mathcal{P}$ represents physically possible actions
- $\mathcal{N}$ represents normatively permitted actions
- $\mathcal{C}$ represents competence-accessible actions

## Computational Models

### Sensorimotor Contingencies

[[Sensorimotor contingencies]] theory formalizes how actions and sensory consequences are interconnected:

$$P(\mathbf{s}_{t+1} | \mathbf{s}_t, \mathbf{a}_t) = \text{SMC}(\mathbf{s}_t, \mathbf{a}_t)$$

Where SMC represents the sensorimotor contingency function mapping current sensation and action to expected next sensation.

### Predictive Processing

The [[predictive processing]] framework models situated agency through prediction-error minimization:

$$\mathbf{a}^* = \arg\min_{\mathbf{a}} \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{s}_{t+1}}\left[\text{KL}[P(\mathbf{s}_{t+1} | \mathbf{s}_t, \mathbf{a}) \| Q(\mathbf{s}_{t+1})]\right]$$

Where:
- $P(\mathbf{s}_{t+1} | \mathbf{s}_t, \mathbf{a})$ is the true sensory distribution given action
- $Q(\mathbf{s}_{t+1})$ is the predicted sensory distribution
- KL is the Kullback-Leibler divergence

### Dynamical Systems Approaches

Dynamical systems models capture the coupled agent-environment dynamics:

$$\dot{\mathbf{x}} = f(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{p})$$

Where:
- $\mathbf{x}$ represents the full agent-environment state
- $\mathbf{p}$ represents parameters
- $f$ is a function defining the flow of the system

## Applications

### Robotics and AI

Situated agency principles inform [[embodied AI]] and robotics approaches that emphasize:
- [[Morphological computation]]
- [[Behavior-based robotics]]
- [[Developmental robotics]]

### Cognitive Science

In cognitive science, situated agency has led to:
- [[Distributed cognition]] models
- [[Situated cognition]] research
- [[4E cognition]] frameworks (Embodied, Embedded, Extended, Enactive)

### Social Theory

Social theorists apply situated agency to understand:
- [[Structure-agency dialectic]]
- [[Practice theory]]
- [[Actor-network theory]]

## Philosophical Implications

### Epistemological

Situated agency challenges [[representationalism]] and suggests knowledge is fundamentally action-oriented:

$$\text{Knowledge} = \{\text{Successful patterns of situated interaction}\}$$

### Ontological

It questions mind-world dualism, suggesting instead a [[relational ontology]]:

$$\text{Mind} \subset \text{Agent-Environment System}$$

### Ethical

It has implications for [[moral agency]] and responsibility:

$$\text{Responsibility} = f(\text{Agency}, \text{Context}, \text{Constraints})$$

## Research Frontiers

Current research examines:
- Formal measures of agent-environment coupling
- [[Material engagement theory]] in artifact usage
- [[Niche construction]] as situated cognitive adaptation
- Implications for [[artificial general intelligence]]
- [[Intersubjective situatedness]] in social cognition

## Integration with Other Frameworks

Situated agency connects with:
- [[Good Regulator Theorem]] in cybernetics
- [[Free energy principle]] in neuroscience
- [[Autopoiesis]] in systems theory
- [[Affordance theory]] in ecological psychology
- [[Participatory sense-making]] in social cognition
