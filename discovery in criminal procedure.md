Discovery in Criminal Procedure


**ASSISTANT**

**Discovery in criminal procedure** refers to the pre-trial phase in a lawsuit where each party can request information and evidence from the other side. The goal is to prevent surprises during the trial, allow both sides to fully prepare their cases, and promote a fair trial by ensuring that all relevant information is available. In the United States, the discovery process in criminal cases is governed by both the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and state rules.

### Key Aspects of Discovery in Criminal Procedure

1. **Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure**
   - **Rule 16(a): Government’s Disclosure**: Details what the prosecution must disclose to the defense.
     - **Documents and Objects**: The prosecution must permit the defense to inspect and copy or photograph books, papers, documents, data, photographs, tangible objects, buildings, or places, or copies or portions of any of these items if the item is within the government's possession, custody, or control and:
       1. The item is material to preparing the defense.
       2. The government intends to use the item in its case-in-chief at trial.
       3. The item was obtained from or belongs to the defendant.
     - **Reports of Examinations and Tests**: The prosecution must permit the defense to inspect and copy or photograph any results or reports of physical or mental examinations and of scientific tests or experiments if:
       1. The item is within the government's possession, custody, or control.
       2. The government intends to use the item in its case-in-chief at trial.
       3. The item is material to preparing the defense.
     - **Expert Witnesses**: The prosecution must provide a written summary of any testimony that the government intends to use under Rules 702, 703, or 705 of the Federal Rules of Evidence during its case-in-chief at trial.

   - **Rule 16(b): Defendant’s Disclosure**: Specifies what the defense must disclose to the prosecution.
     - **Documents and Objects**: The defense must permit the government to inspect and copy or photograph books, papers, documents, data, photographs, tangible objects, buildings, or places, or copies or portions of any of these items if:
       1. The item is within the defendant’s possession, custody, or control.
       2. The defendant intends to use the item in the defendant’s case-in-chief at trial.
     - **Reports of Examinations and Tests**: The defense must permit the government to inspect and copy or photograph any results or reports of physical or mental examinations and of scientific tests or experiments if:
       1. The item is within the defendant’s possession, custody, or control.
       2. The defendant intends to use the item in the defendant’s case-in-chief at trial or intends to call the witness who prepared the report and the report relates to the witness’s testimony.

   - **Rule 16(c): Continuing Duty to Disclose**: Both parties have a continuing duty to disclose additional evidence or material that comes to their attention before or during trial if it falls under the scope of Rule 16.

2. **Brady Rule**
   - Established in *Brady v. Maryland*, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), this rule requires the prosecution to disclose any [[exculpatory evidence]] to the defense. Exculpatory evidence is any evidence that might exonerate the defendant or reduce their culpability.
   - The Brady Rule is a key component of discovery, ensuring that the prosecution does not withhold evidence that could affect the outcome of the trial.

3. **Giglio v. United States**
   - This extends the Brady Rule to include the disclosure of any evidence that could impeach the credibility of a government witness, such as promises of leniency or immunity made to witnesses in exchange for their testimony.

4. **Jencks Act (18 U.S.C. § 3500)**
   - Requires the prosecution to produce any statement or report made by a government witness or prospective government witness, but only after the witness has testified on direct examination at trial.

### Practical Implications

1. **Defense Preparation**: Discovery allows the defense to fully understand the prosecution's case, prepare counterarguments, and gather evidence to support the defendant's case.
2. **Prosecutorial Duty**: The prosecution must actively seek and disclose any evidence favorable to the defense, including both exculpatory and [[impeachment evidence]].
3. **Judicial Oversight**: Courts oversee the discovery process to ensure compliance with the rules and address disputes or non-compliance issues.

### Example Scenario

Consider a case where the defendant, Bob, is charged with burglary. During discovery, the following exchanges might occur:
- **Prosecution Disclosure**: The prosecution provides the defense with surveillance footage of the crime, fingerprints lifted from the crime scene, and a summary of the expert testimony on the fingerprints.
- **Defense Disclosure**: The defense shares its expert’s analysis that the fingerprints do not match Bob’s, and they provide an alibi witness list.
- **Exculpatory Evidence**: The prosecution discovers and discloses a witness statement indicating that someone else was seen committing the burglary at the same time Bob was supposedly involved.

### Mathematical Analogy

Discovery can be viewed as a process of updating probabilities and expectations in light of new evidence, akin to **Bayesian Inference**. For example, if \( P(\text{Guilt}) \) is the prior probability of the defendant’s guilt, the discovery of [[exculpatory evidence]] \( E \) can update this probability:
$$ P(\text{Guilt} \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid \text{Guilt}) \cdot P(\text{Guilt})}{P(E)} $$
where \( P(E \mid \text{Guilt}) \) is the likelihood of the evidence assuming the defendant's guilt, and \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence.

Discovery in criminal procedure is a critical aspect of the legal process that ensures both sides have access to relevant information, promoting fairness and accuracy in the pursuit of justice. Understanding the rules and principles of discovery helps maintain the [[integrity]] of the criminal justice system.
