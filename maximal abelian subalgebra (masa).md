### Maximal Abelian Subalgebra (MASA)

A **maximal abelian subalgebra (MASA)** of a Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ is a subalgebra $\mathfrak{h}$ that is abelian (i.e., $[H_1, H_2] = 0$ for all $H_1, H_2 \in \mathfrak{h}$) and maximal with respect to this property. This means that $\mathfrak{h}$ is not properly contained in any larger abelian subalgebra of $\mathfrak{g}$.

### Properties

1. **Commutativity**: For all $H_1, H_2 \in \mathfrak{h}$, the Lie bracket $[H_1, H_2] = 0$. This implies that the elements of $\mathfrak{h}$ commute under the Lie bracket operation.
2. **Maximality**: There is no larger subalgebra $\mathfrak{h}' \supset \mathfrak{h}$ within $\mathfrak{g}$ that is also abelian.

### Examples

#### Example 1: Diagonal Matrices

In the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{gl}(n, \mathbb{R})$ of all $n \times n$ real matrices, the set of all diagonal matrices forms a MASA. This is because diagonal matrices commute with each other and any abelian subalgebra of $\mathfrak{gl}(n, \mathbb{R})$ can be simultaneously diagonalized if it consists of diagonalizable matrices.

#### Example 2: Cartan Subalgebra

In the context of semisimple Lie algebras, a **Cartan subalgebra** is a MASA that is additionally nilpotent (all elements are simultaneously triangularizable). For a semisimple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, a Cartan subalgebra $\mathfrak{h}$ plays a crucial role in the structure and classification of $\mathfrak{g}$. 

### Role in Lie Theory

Maximal abelian subalgebras are essential in the study of Lie algebras because they often serve as a starting point for understanding the structure of the entire algebra. In particular, in semisimple Lie algebras, Cartan subalgebras allow for the decomposition of the algebra into root spaces, which facilitates the classification and representation of the algebra.

### Cartan Subalgebras

A **Cartan subalgebra** $\mathfrak{h}$ of a Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ is a MASA that is also nilpotent. Cartan subalgebras have the following additional properties:
1. **Diagonalizability**: Elements of $\mathfrak{h}$ are simultaneously diagonalizable over the complex numbers.
2. **Root Decomposition**: The Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ can be decomposed into a direct sum of root spaces relative to $\mathfrak{h}$. Specifically,
   $$ \mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{h} \oplus \bigoplus_{\alpha \in \Delta} \mathfrak{g}_\alpha, $$
   where $\Delta$ is the set of roots and $\mathfrak{g}_\alpha = \{ X \in \mathfrak{g} \mid [H, X] = \alpha(H)X \text{ for all } H \in \mathfrak{h} \}$.

### Applications

#### Classification of Lie Algebras

Cartan subalgebras are instrumental in the classification of semisimple Lie algebras. The [[root system]] associated with a Cartan subalgebra provides a way to classify the Lie algebra up to isomorphism.

#### Representation Theory

In representation theory, Cartan subalgebras help in defining weights and studying how representations decompose into weight spaces. Each weight corresponds to an eigenvalue of the Cartan subalgebra acting on the representation space.

#### Algebraic Geometry

In algebraic geometry, the action of a Lie group on an algebraic variety can often be understood by studying the action of its Lie algebra. MASAs help in analyzing invariant subvarieties and understanding the symmetries of the variety.
