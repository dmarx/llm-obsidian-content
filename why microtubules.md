why microtubules?

### Why Microtubules?

Microtubules have been proposed as the central structures for quantum computation in the Orchestrated Objective Reduction (Orch-OR) theory for several reasons:

#### Structural and Functional Properties

1. **Cytoskeletal Role**:
   Microtubules are integral components of the cell's cytoskeleton, providing structural support and facilitating intracellular transport. In neurons, they are involved in maintaining the structure and function of axons and dendrites, essential for signal transmission.

2. **Information Processing**:
   It has been hypothesized that microtubules could play a role in intracellular information processing. The arrangement of tubulin dimers within microtubules forms a highly regular, lattice-like structure that could theoretically support complex patterns of information storage and processing.

#### Quantum Properties

1. **Quantum Coherence**:
   For Orch-OR to be viable, the biological structure involved must support quantum coherence—the maintenance of superposition states over biologically relevant timescales. Microtubules, due to their regular and repetitive structure, are proposed to have properties that might enable quantum coherence.

2. **Froehlich Condensates**:
   Herbert Froehlich proposed that biological systems, including microtubules, could support coherent excitations akin to Bose-Einstein condensates at physiological temperatures. This theory suggests that under certain conditions, energy within microtubules could be coherent and ordered, possibly enabling quantum effects.

3. **Resonant Frequencies**:
   Microtubules and their subunit proteins (tubulins) exhibit resonance at various frequencies. These resonant properties might be conducive to sustaining coherent quantum states, as suggested by the model.

#### Empirical and Theoretical Considerations

1. **Experimental Observations**:
   Some experimental studies have hinted at non-trivial quantum effects in microtubules, such as the presence of quantum beats and interference patterns. Although these findings are contentious and require further verification, they provide some empirical grounding for the theory.

2. **Mathematical Models**:
   Theoretical models of microtubules have been developed to explore their potential as quantum computing elements. These models often draw analogies between the structure and dynamics of microtubules and known quantum systems.

#### Hypothesized Mechanisms

1. **Tubulin States**:
   In the Orch-OR model, tubulin proteins within microtubules are considered to exist in superposition states, functioning as quantum bits (qubits). The switching between different conformational states of tubulin is proposed to enable quantum computations.

2. **Decoherence and Isolation**:
   One of the major challenges for any biological quantum computation model is the issue of [[decoherence]]—how quickly quantum information degrades due to interaction with the environment. Microtubules are suggested to have certain structural features and interactions (e.g., with surrounding cytoskeletal elements and cellular membranes) that might mitigate rapid [[decoherence]].

3. **Orchestration by Synaptic Activity**:
   Synaptic inputs and other cellular activities are hypothesized to modulate the quantum states within microtubules, effectively orchestrating the quantum computations. This interaction between classical neuronal activity and quantum processes is central to the Orch-OR theory.

#### Criticisms and Challenges

1. **Decoherence Time Scales**:
   A significant criticism of using microtubules for quantum computation is the rapid [[decoherence]] expected in the warm, noisy environment of the brain. Critics argue that any quantum states would collapse too quickly to be useful for cognition.

2. **Empirical Support**:
   The lack of direct empirical evidence for large-scale quantum effects in microtubules is a major hurdle. Current biological and quantum physical experiments have not conclusively demonstrated the necessary conditions for sustained quantum coherence in these structures.

3. **Alternative Explanations**:
   There are many alternative explanations for cognitive processes that do not require quantum mechanics. Classical computational models, neural network theories, and other approaches offer robust frameworks for understanding brain function without invoking quantum phenomena.

### Conclusion

Microtubules are proposed as key components in the Orch-OR model due to their unique structural properties, potential for supporting quantum coherence, and their critical role in neuronal function. While the theory presents an intriguing possibility, it faces significant empirical and theoretical challenges. Further research is needed to validate or refute the hypothesis that microtubules could serve as quantum computing elements underlying consciousness.
