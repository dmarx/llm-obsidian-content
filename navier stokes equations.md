The Navier-Stokes equations are a set of nonlinear partial differential equations that describe the motion of fluid substances such as liquids and gases. These equations are fundamental to the field of fluid dynamics and can be used to model various phenomena including weather patterns, ocean currents, and airflow around wings.

The Navier-Stokes equations are based on Newton's second law of motion, applied to fluid motion, and they incorporate the concepts of momentum, mass conservation, and energy conservation.

## The Equations

### Continuity Equation
The continuity equation represents the conservation of mass. For an incompressible fluid, it can be written as:
$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} = 0
$$
where $\mathbf{u}$ is the velocity vector field of the fluid.

### Momentum Equation
The momentum equation, representing the conservation of momentum, is given by the Navier-Stokes equation:
$$
\rho \left( \frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u} \right) = -\nabla p + \mu \nabla^2 \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{f}
$$
where:
- $\rho$ is the fluid density,
- $\mathbf{u}$ is the velocity vector field,
- $t$ is time,
- $p$ is the pressure field,
- $\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid,
- $\mathbf{f}$ represents external forces (e.g., gravity).

### Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equation
For an incompressible and Newtonian fluid, combining the continuity and momentum equations gives:
$$
\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u} = -\frac{1}{\rho} \nabla p + \nu \nabla^2 \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{f}
$$
where $\nu = \frac{\mu}{\rho}$ is the kinematic viscosity.

### Boundary Conditions
The Navier-Stokes equations require appropriate boundary conditions to be solved. Common boundary conditions include:
- **No-slip condition**: The fluid velocity at a solid boundary is equal to the velocity of the boundary.
- **Free-slip condition**: The normal component of the velocity at the boundary is zero, and the tangential component is unconstrained.

### Non-Dimensional Form
The equations are often non-dimensionalized to highlight key dimensionless numbers that govern the flow regimes. The most notable is the Reynolds number $Re$, defined as:
$$
Re = \frac{\rho U L}{\mu} = \frac{UL}{\nu}
$$
where $U$ is a characteristic velocity, and $L$ is a characteristic length scale.

## Mathematical Properties
### Existence and Uniqueness
The mathematical problem of proving the existence and smoothness of solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations in three dimensions is one of the seven "Millennium Prize Problems" for which the Clay Mathematics Institute has offered a prize of $1,000,000.

### Turbulence
For high Reynolds numbers, solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations exhibit turbulent behavior, characterized by chaotic, stochastic changes in the fluid properties. This is a significant challenge in fluid dynamics as it requires advanced techniques in numerical analysis and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to approximate solutions.

### Linearization and Simplification
In certain regimes, the Navier-Stokes equations can be simplified. For example:
- **Stokes flow** (creeping flow): For very low Reynolds numbers, inertial terms can be neglected, leading to a linearized form.
- **Euler equations**: In the absence of viscosity ($\mu = 0$), the equations reduce to the Euler equations for inviscid flow.

The Navier-Stokes equations are thus a central topic in [[fluid dynamics]], and their study involves a blend of theoretical analysis, numerical methods, and experimental validation. They are foundational for understanding and predicting fluid behavior in both natural and engineered systems.
