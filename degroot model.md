The DeGroot model


**ASSISTANT**

The DeGroot model is a fundamental framework in the study of [[opinion dynamics]] within social networks. It describes how individuals in a network update their beliefs or opinions based on the opinions of their neighbors, leading to consensus or polarization over time.

### Basic Model

The DeGroot model assumes a network of agents (individuals) who update their opinions through weighted averaging of their neighbors' opinions.

#### Notation

- Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph representing the social network, where $V$ is the set of nodes (agents) and $E$ is the set of edges (connections between agents).
- Each agent $i \in V$ has an opinion $x_i(t)$ at time $t$.
- The opinion vector at time $t$ is denoted by $\mathbf{x}(t) = [x_1(t), x_2(t), \ldots, x_n(t)]^T$, where $n$ is the number of agents.

#### Update Rule

The opinion update rule in the DeGroot model is:
$$
x_i(t+1) = \sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij} x_j(t)
$$
where $a_{ij}$ is the weight that agent $i$ places on the opinion of agent $j$. These weights form the entries of a stochastic matrix $A = [a_{ij}]$ with the properties:
- $a_{ij} \geq 0$ (non-negative weights)
- $\sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij} = 1$ (each row sums to 1)

This can be compactly written in matrix form as:
$$
\mathbf{x}(t+1) = A \mathbf{x}(t)
$$

### Convergence Properties

The convergence of opinions depends on the structure of the matrix $A$ and the underlying network $G$.

#### Conditions for Consensus

1. **Strongly Connected Network**: If the network is strongly connected (i.e., there is a path between any two agents), then the opinions will converge to a consensus.

2. **Aperiodic**: The network should not be cyclic or should have a period of 1.

3. **Primitive Matrix**: Matrix $A$ is primitive if there exists a power $k$ such that all entries of $A^k$ are positive. If $A$ is primitive, then the system reaches a consensus.

In the case of consensus, all agents' opinions converge to a common value:
$$
\lim_{t \to \infty} \mathbf{x}(t) = \mathbf{x}^*
$$
where $\mathbf{x}^* = c \mathbf{1}$, with $\mathbf{1}$ being a vector of ones and $c$ being a constant that depends on the initial opinions and the weights in $A$.

### Examples

#### Simple Network

Consider a network of three agents with the following initial opinions and weight matrix:
- Initial opinions: $\mathbf{x}(0) = [0.2, 0.4, 0.6]^T$
- Weight matrix:
  $$
  A = \begin{bmatrix}
  0.5 & 0.5 & 0 \\
  0.25 & 0.5 & 0.25 \\
  0 & 0.5 & 0.5
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$

Using the update rule:
$$
\mathbf{x}(1) = A \mathbf{x}(0) = \begin{bmatrix}
0.5 & 0.5 & 0 \\
0.25 & 0.5 & 0.25 \\
0 & 0.5 & 0.5
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
0.2 \\
0.4 \\
0.6
\end{bmatrix}
= \begin{bmatrix}
0.3 \\
0.375 \\
0.5
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Repeating this process will show how opinions converge over time.

### Variants and Extensions

#### Bounded Confidence Models

In bounded confidence models, agents only consider the opinions of others if they are within a certain confidence interval. This can prevent consensus and lead to the formation of opinion clusters.

#### Weighted DeGroot Model

Weights $a_{ij}$ can be dynamic and adapt based on various factors like trust, influence, or the difference in opinions.

### Applications

The DeGroot model has been used in various applications, including:

1. **Consensus Formation**: Understanding how consensus emerges in social, economic, and political contexts.
2. **Distributed Computing**: Designing algorithms for consensus in distributed systems.
3. **Marketing**: Modeling the spread of information or products through social networks.

### Conclusion

The DeGroot model provides a simple yet powerful framework for studying [[opinion dynamics]] and consensus formation in networks. Its principles are foundational in understanding how local interactions and weighted influences can lead to global patterns of agreement or polarization.
