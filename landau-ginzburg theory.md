Landau-Ginzburg Theory


**ASSISTANT**

The Landau-Ginzburg theory, also known as the Ginzburg-Landau theory, is a phenomenological framework for understanding phase transitions, particularly continuous (second-order) phase transitions. It was developed by Lev Landau and Vitaly Ginzburg to describe the behavior of order parameters near critical points and has been instrumental in the study of superconductivity, magnetism, and other areas of condensed matter physics.

## Overview

### Order Parameter

The central concept in Landau-Ginzburg theory is the order parameter, a quantity that characterizes the degree of order in the system. Near the critical point, the order parameter changes continuously from zero in one phase to a nonzero value in the other phase. Examples include the magnetization in a ferromagnet and the superfluid density in a superconductor.

### Free Energy Functional

The Landau-Ginzburg theory describes the system in terms of a [[free energy functional]] \( F[\phi] \), where \(\phi\) is the order parameter field. The free energy is expanded as a power series in \(\phi\) and its gradients, assuming that \(\phi\) is small near the critical point.

The general form of the Landau-Ginzburg [[free energy functional]] in \(d\)-dimensional space is:

$$
F[\phi] = \int d^d x \left( \frac{1}{2} \alpha \phi^2 + \frac{1}{4} \beta \phi^4 + \frac{1}{2} \kappa (\nabla \phi)^2 \right)
$$

where:
- \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are phenomenological coefficients,
- \(\kappa\) is a positive constant ensuring stability,
- \(\nabla \phi\) represents the spatial variation of the order parameter.

### Phase Transitions

#### Symmetric Phase (\(\alpha > 0\))

When \(\alpha > 0\), the free energy has a single minimum at \(\phi = 0\), corresponding to the symmetric phase where the order parameter is zero.

#### Broken Symmetry Phase (\(\alpha < 0\))

When \(\alpha < 0\), the free energy has minima at \(\phi = \pm \sqrt{-\alpha/\beta}\), corresponding to the broken symmetry phase where the order parameter is nonzero.

### Critical Point

The critical point occurs at \(\alpha = 0\), where the system transitions from the symmetric phase to the broken symmetry phase.

## Equations of Motion

The equilibrium configuration of the order parameter is obtained by minimizing the [[free energy functional]] \( F[\phi] \). This leads to the Euler-Lagrange equation:

$$
\frac{\delta F}{\delta \phi} = 0
$$

For the Landau-Ginzburg [[free energy functional]], this gives:

$$
\alpha \phi + \beta \phi^3 - \kappa \nabla^2 \phi = 0
$$

This is a nonlinear partial differential equation that describes the spatial variation of the order parameter near the critical point.

## Applications

### Superconductivity

The Landau-Ginzburg theory was originally developed to describe superconductivity. The order parameter \(\psi\) in this context represents the complex wave function of the superconducting Cooper pairs. The Landau-Ginzburg free energy for a superconductor includes an additional term for the electromagnetic field:

$$
F[\psi, \mathbf{A}] = \int d^3 x \left( \alpha |\psi|^2 + \frac{\beta}{2} |\psi|^4 + \frac{\kappa}{2} |(\nabla - 2ie\mathbf{A}) \psi|^2 + \frac{1}{8\pi} (\nabla \times \mathbf{A})^2 \right)
$$

where \(\mathbf{A}\) is the vector potential of the magnetic field, and \(e\) is the electron charge.

### Magnetism

In ferromagnetism, the order parameter \(\mathbf{M}\) represents the magnetization. The Landau-Ginzburg [[free energy functional]] for a ferromagnet is:

$$
F[\mathbf{M}] = \int d^3 x \left( \frac{1}{2} \alpha \mathbf{M}^2 + \frac{1}{4} \beta (\mathbf{M}^2)^2 + \frac{\kappa}{2} (\nabla \mathbf{M})^2 \right)
$$

### Phase Separation

The Landau-Ginzburg theory is also used to describe [[phase separation]] in binary mixtures, where the order parameter represents the concentration difference between the two components.

## Critical Phenomena and Scaling

### Critical Exponents

The Landau-Ginzburg theory provides a framework for calculating critical exponents, which describe how physical quantities diverge near the critical point. These exponents are related to the behavior of the order parameter, specific heat, susceptibility, and correlation length.

### Renormalization Group

The Landau-Ginzburg theory serves as a starting point for the renormalization group (RG) analysis, which provides a systematic way to study the effects of fluctuations and derive critical exponents beyond [[mean field theory]].

## Mean Field Theory

In [[mean field theory]], fluctuations of the order parameter are neglected, and the free energy is minimized assuming a uniform order parameter. This approximation provides the mean field critical exponents:
- \(\alpha = 0\)
- \(\beta = \frac{1}{2}\)
- \(\gamma = 1\)
- \(\delta = 3\)
- \(\nu = \frac{1}{2}\)
- \(\eta = 0\)

### Corrections to Mean Field Theory

Below the upper critical dimension \(d_c = 4\), fluctuations become important, and the mean field exponents are modified. The RG approach provides a way to calculate these corrections and determine the true critical behavior.
