Runge's phenomenon


**ASSISTANT**

Runge's phenomenon is an issue that arises when using high-degree polynomial interpolation at equally spaced points. The phenomenon, named after the German mathematician Carl Runge, shows that as the degree of the interpolating polynomial increases, the polynomial tends to oscillate wildly, particularly near the endpoints of the interpolation interval. This can result in poor approximation and large errors, even though the interpolating polynomial passes exactly through the given data points.

### Runge's Example

Runge's classic example involves interpolating the function:
\[ f(x) = \frac{1}{1 + 25x^2} \]
on the interval \([-1, 1]\).

When interpolating this function using high-degree polynomials at equally spaced points, the interpolation error increases significantly near the endpoints of the interval.

### Mathematical Explanation

Given a set of \( n+1 \) equally spaced points \( x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_n \) in the interval \([-1, 1]\), the interpolating polynomial \( P_n(x) \) of degree \( n \) is the unique polynomial that satisfies:
\[ P_n(x_i) = f(x_i) \quad \text{for} \; i = 0, 1, \ldots, n. \]

For large \( n \), the interpolating polynomial \( P_n(x) \) can exhibit large oscillations, particularly near the endpoints \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 1 \). These oscillations are due to the equidistant spacing of the interpolation points.

### Mitigating Runge's Phenomenon

Several strategies can be used to mitigate Runge's phenomenon:

1. **Using Chebyshev Nodes**:
   Interpolating the function at Chebyshev nodes rather than equally spaced points can significantly reduce the oscillations. Chebyshev nodes are the roots of the Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind:
   \[
   x_k = \cos\left(\frac{2k+1}{2n+2} \pi\right) \quad \text{for} \; k = 0, 1, \ldots, n.
   \]
   These nodes are more densely packed near the endpoints of the interval, which helps control the oscillations.

2. **Piecewise Interpolation (Spline Interpolation)**:
   Using piecewise polynomials, such as cubic splines, can provide better approximations without the large oscillations seen in high-degree polynomial interpolation.

3. **Reducing the Polynomial Degree**:
   Interpolating with a lower-degree polynomial over smaller subintervals can also help reduce oscillations.

### Example in Python

Hereâ€™s a Python example demonstrating Runge's phenomenon and how using Chebyshev nodes can mitigate it:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the Runge function
def runge_function(x):
    return 1 / (1 + 25 * x**2)

# Generate equidistant nodes
def equidistant_nodes(n):
    return np.linspace(-1, 1, n + 1)

# Generate Chebyshev nodes
def chebyshev_nodes(n):
    return np.cos((2 * np.arange(n + 1) + 1) * np.pi / (2 * (n + 1)))

# Interpolation function
def interpolate(x, y, xx):
    return np.polyval(np.polyfit(x, y, len(x) - 1), xx)

# Number of interpolation points
n = 10

# Equidistant nodes and values
x_equidistant = equidistant_nodes(n)
y_equidistant = runge_function(x_equidistant)

# Chebyshev nodes and values
x_chebyshev = chebyshev_nodes(n)
y_chebyshev = runge_function(x_chebyshev)

# Points for plotting
xx = np.linspace(-1, 1, 400)
yy = runge_function(xx)

# Interpolated values
yy_equidistant = interpolate(x_equidistant, y_equidistant, xx)
yy_chebyshev = interpolate(x_chebyshev, y_chebyshev, xx)

# Plot the results
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))

plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
plt.plot(xx, yy, 'k', label='Runge function')
plt.plot(xx, yy_equidistant, 'r', label='Equidistant interpolation')
plt.scatter(x_equidistant, y_equidistant, c='r')
plt.title('Equidistant Nodes')
plt.legend()

plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
plt.plot(xx, yy, 'k', label='Runge function')
plt.plot(xx, yy_chebyshev, 'b', label='Chebyshev interpolation')
plt.scatter(x_chebyshev, y_chebyshev, c='b')
plt.title('Chebyshev Nodes')
plt.legend()

plt.show()
```

### Results

The plot generated by this script shows two subplots:

1. **Equidistant Nodes**: The interpolation using equidistant nodes exhibits significant oscillations, especially near the endpoints, illustrating Runge's phenomenon.
2. **Chebyshev Nodes**: The interpolation using Chebyshev nodes provides a much better approximation with significantly reduced oscillations.

### Conclusion

Runge's phenomenon demonstrates the limitations of high-degree polynomial interpolation at equally spaced points. To mitigate this issue, techniques such as using Chebyshev nodes, piecewise interpolation (splines), or reducing the polynomial degree should be employed. These approaches provide more accurate and stable interpolations, avoiding the large oscillations characteristic of Runge's phenomenon.
