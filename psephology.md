### Psephology

**Psephology** is the statistical study and analysis of elections and voting patterns. The term derives from the Greek word *psephos* (meaning "pebble"), which refers to ancient Greek voting practices using pebbles. As a multidisciplinary field, psephology incorporates methods and theories from [[statistics]], [[political science]], [[sociology]], and even [[psychology]].

### Core Concepts in Psephology

#### 1. **Voting Systems**
Psephology examines the rules and structures that govern elections, including:
- **Majoritarian systems** (e.g., first-past-the-post).
- **Proportional representation** systems.
- **Mixed-member systems** and their hybrid approaches.

Each system impacts how votes translate into seats, influencing strategic voting and voter turnout.

#### 2. **Electoral Behavior**
Analyzing voter decision-making patterns:
- **Socioeconomic influences**: income, education, and occupation.
- **Demographic factors**: age, gender, and ethnicity.
- **Psychological models**: party identification and issue-based voting.

#### 3. **Statistical Modeling of Elections**
Models of voter behavior and outcomes often involve:
- **Regression analysis** to estimate the impact of factors on vote choice.
- **Multilevel modeling** for nested data structures (e.g., voters within districts).
- **Cluster analysis** to identify groups with similar voting behaviors.

#### 4. **Poll Analysis**
Statistical methods evaluate polling data for accuracy:
- **Sampling theory** to understand biases in survey results.
- **Error margins** and confidence intervals to assess predictions.
- **Weighting** to adjust for demographic imbalances in poll samples.

### Mathematical Foundations

Psephology relies heavily on statistical tools and probabilistic reasoning:

#### a) **Estimating Vote Shares**
Suppose a population of $N$ voters, partitioned into demographic groups $D_1, D_2, \ldots, D_k$. Each group $D_i$ has a proportion $p_i$ and supports candidate $A$ with probability $q_i$. The overall support for $A$ is given by:
$$
P_A = \sum_{i=1}^k p_i q_i.
$$

#### b) **Swing Analysis**
Swing measures the change in vote share between two elections. Let $V_{A,t}$ and $V_{A,t+1}$ represent candidate $A$'s vote share at time $t$ and $t+1$. The swing is defined as:
$$
\text{Swing} = V_{A,t+1} - V_{A,t}.
$$

#### c) **Predictive Models**
Bayesian inference is often employed to update predictions about election outcomes:
$$
P(\theta | X) = \frac{P(X | \theta) P(\theta)}{P(X)},
$$
where $\theta$ represents the parameter of interest (e.g., party support), and $X$ is the observed data (e.g., poll results).

### Applications of Psephology

1. **Redistricting and Gerrymandering**: Evaluating the fairness of electoral boundaries using measures like the **efficiency gap**.
2. **Forecasting Elections**: Predictive models combine polling data, historical trends, and economic indicators.
3. **Evaluating Electoral Reforms**: Simulations test the impact of rule changes on electoral outcomes.

### Challenges in Psephology

1. **Sampling Bias**: Polls may underrepresent certain demographics.
2. **Nonresponse Bias**: Systematic differences between those who participate in polls and those who do not.
3. **Complex Systems**: Voter behavior is influenced by many interrelated factors, making causality difficult to establish.
