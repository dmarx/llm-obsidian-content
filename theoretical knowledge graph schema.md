title: theoretical knowledge graph schema

**USER**

how do theoretical claims fit into this framework? what if a paper introduces a unit of knowledge purely analytically?

# Theoretical Knowledge Graph Schema

```
TheoreticalClaim = {
  statement: String,
  proof: {
    assumptions: Set<Assumption>,
    steps: [LogicalStep],
    conclusion: Theorem
  },
  dependencies: {
    required: Set<PriorTheorem>,
    citations: Set<Citation>
  },
  generalizes: Set<PriorTheorem>,
  specializes: Set<PriorTheorem>
}
```

## Example: Lottery Ticket Hypothesis

```
Claim: {
  type: "theoretical",
  statement: "Dense networks contain sparse subnetworks achieving similar accuracy",
  proof: {
    assumptions: [
      "Sufficient network width",
      "Random initialization"
    ],
    key_steps: ["Iterative magnitude pruning"],
    conditions: ["Original initialization preserved"]
  },
  empirical_validation: {
    benchmarks: ["MNIST", "CIFAR-10"],
    reliability: weighted_mean([0.9, 0.85])
  },
  theoretical_extensions: [{
    paper: "Malach2020",
    claim: "Linear mode connectivity",
    strengthens: "original_proof",
    adds_assumption: "Loss landscape continuity"
  }]
}
```

## Strengths
- Captures proof dependencies
- Links theory to empirical validation
- Tracks theoretical refinements

## Weaknesses
- Formalization of proof steps
- Granularity of assumptions
- Measuring theoretical impact
