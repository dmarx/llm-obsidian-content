Tridiagonal Structure


**ASSISTANT**

A tridiagonal matrix is a special type of sparse matrix that has non-zero elements only on the main diagonal and the two adjacent diagonals (the subdiagonal and the superdiagonal). This structure arises naturally in many numerical methods and applications, particularly in solving differential equations and eigenvalue problems.

## Definition

A matrix \( T \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} \) is tridiagonal if:

$$ t_{ij} = 0 \quad \text{for} \quad |i - j| > 1 $$

Explicitly, this means \( T \) has the form:

$$
T = \begin{pmatrix}
t_{11} & t_{12} & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
t_{21} & t_{22} & t_{23} & \cdots & 0 \\
0 & t_{32} & t_{33} & \cdots & 0 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & t_{n-1,n} \\
0 & 0 & 0 & t_{n,n-1} & t_{nn}
\end{pmatrix}
$$

where \( t_{ii} \) are the main diagonal elements, \( t_{i,i+1} \) are the superdiagonal elements, and \( t_{i+1,i} \) are the subdiagonal elements.

## Properties

1. **Sparse Structure**: Only \( 3n - 2 \) non-zero elements, making matrix operations more efficient.
2. **Band Matrix**: A special case of a band matrix with bandwidth 1.
3. **Symmetric Case**: If \( T \) is symmetric, then \( t_{i,i+1} = t_{i+1,i} \).

## Applications

### Numerical Linear Algebra

1. **Eigenvalue Problems**:
   - **QR Algorithm**: The QR algorithm is particularly efficient for tridiagonal matrices, preserving the tridiagonal structure at each iteration. This efficiency makes it a preferred method for computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors of symmetric matrices reduced to tridiagonal form.

2. **Solving Linear Systems**:
   - **Thomas Algorithm**: A specialized form of Gaussian elimination for tridiagonal systems, also known as the tridiagonal matrix algorithm (TDMA). It operates in \( O(n) \) time, significantly faster than general \( O(n^3) \) Gaussian elimination.

### Differential Equations

1. **Finite Difference Method**: Discretization of differential equations often leads to tridiagonal systems. For example, the second-order central difference approximation of the one-dimensional Poisson equation \( -u''(x) = f(x) \) on a grid yields a tridiagonal matrix.

## Example

Consider solving the tridiagonal system \( Tx = b \) using the Thomas algorithm:

### Example System

$$
T = \begin{pmatrix}
2 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\
-1 & 2 & -1 & 0 \\
0 & -1 & 2 & -1 \\
0 & 0 & -1 & 2
\end{pmatrix}, \quad b = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
$$

### Thomas Algorithm

1. **Forward Elimination**:

   Define \( c_i = \frac{t_{i,i+1}}{t_{i,i}} \) and update \( t_{i+1,i+1} \) and \( b_{i+1} \):

   For \( i = 1 \) to \( n-1 \):

   $$ c_i = \frac{t_{i,i+1}}{t_{i,i}} $$
   $$ t_{i+1,i+1} = t_{i+1,i+1} - c_i t_{i+1,i} $$
   $$ b_{i+1} = b_{i+1} - c_i b_i $$

   Steps:

   - \( c_1 = \frac{-1}{2} = -0.5 \)
   - Update: \( t_{22} = 2 - (-0.5)(-1) = 1.5 \), \( b_2 = 2 - (-0.5)(1) = 1.5 \)
   - \( c_2 = \frac{-1}{1.5} \approx -0.6667 \)
   - Update: \( t_{33} = 2 - (-0.6667)(-1) \approx 1.3333 \), \( b_3 = 2 - (-0.6667)(1.5) \approx 1.0 \)
   - \( c_3 = \frac{-1}{1.3333} \approx -0.75 \)
   - Update: \( t_{44} = 2 - (-0.75)(-1) = 1.25 \), \( b_4 = 1 - (-0.75)(1) = 0.25 \)

2. **Back Substitution**:

   Solve \( x_n \) and then \( x_i \) for \( i = n-1, n-2, \ldots, 1 \):

   $$ x_n = \frac{b_n}{t_{n,n}} $$
   $$ x_i = \frac{b_i - t_{i,i+1} x_{i+1}}{t_{i,i}} $$

   Steps:

   - \( x_4 = \frac{0.25}{1.25} = 0.2 \)
   - \( x_3 = \frac{1 - (-1)(0.2)}{1.3333} \approx 0.9 \)
   - \( x_2 = \frac{1.5 - (-1)(0.9)}{1.5} = 1.6 \)
   - \( x_1 = \frac{1 - (-1)(1.6)}{2} = 1.3 \)

   Solution: \( x = \begin{pmatrix} 1.3 \\ 1.6 \\ 0.9 \\ 0.2 \end{pmatrix} \)
