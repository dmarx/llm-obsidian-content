Shōma Morita's philosophy


**ASSISTANT**

Shōma Morita (1874–1938) was a Japanese psychiatrist who developed Morita therapy, a psychological treatment method that integrates aspects of Zen Buddhism into traditional therapeutic practices. His approach is often seen as a precursor to some of the contemporary practices in psychotherapy, particularly those that focus on acceptance and mindfulness. Morita's philosophy emphasizes accepting life as it is, without overly trying to control or change one's internal emotional states.

### Key Concepts of Morita Therapy

#### 1. **Acceptance of Feelings**
Morita therapy teaches that feelings like anxiety, fear, and depression are natural parts of human life. Instead of attempting to eliminate these feelings, Morita advocated for accepting them as they are. The therapy emphasizes that what matters more than your feelings is what you do despite them. This concept is akin to the mindfulness and acceptance-based strategies seen in modern therapeutic approaches like Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT).

#### 2. **Purposeful Action**
Morita therapy places a strong emphasis on taking action regardless of one's emotional state. Rather than waiting to feel better or motivated, individuals are encouraged to engage in meaningful activities and to fulfill their roles in life, thus shifting focus from internal feelings to external tasks. This aspect of Morita's philosophy underscores the importance of behavior in improving mental health and overall functioning.

#### 3. **Natural Healing**
Morita believed in the natural healing process, akin to the body's way of healing physical wounds. He suggested that psychological disturbances can similarly heal if given a proper environment and mindset. This involves embracing natural emotional cycles rather than fighting them, which aligns with letting psychological processes unfold without excessive interference.

#### 4. **Self-observation and Self-reflection**
Part of Morita therapy involves periods of rest and introspection, where patients observe their thoughts and feelings without judgment. This self-reflection is aimed at understanding oneself better and becoming more attuned to one’s authentic desires and needs, facilitating a deeper connection with one’s life path.

### Philosophical and Practical Implications

#### **Philosophical Implications**
Morita’s philosophy challenges the Western therapeutic emphasis on controlling or changing emotions. It brings a distinctively Eastern perspective to mental health, focusing on harmony with one's intrinsic nature and the acceptance of life's impermanence and inherent suffering.

#### **Practical Implications**
In practice, Morita therapy is applied in various contexts, from treating anxiety and depression to managing stress and enhancing personal growth. Its emphasis on action and acceptance makes it particularly useful for people who feel stuck in their emotional states or those who tend to ruminate excessively.

### Influence and Reception

Morita therapy has influenced not only psychological practice within Japan but also gained attention in the West, particularly among practitioners and theorists interested in integrating Eastern philosophies with Western therapeutic practices. The therapy’s focus on acceptance and commitment has parallels in other therapeutic approaches, notably in ACT, which also emphasizes accepting one's psychological experiences while committing to action that aligns with one's values.

### Conclusion

Shōma Morita’s philosophy offers a refreshing perspective on the nature of mental health and the treatment of psychological disorders. By integrating the principles of Zen Buddhism with a pragmatic focus on action and the naturalistic view of emotional life, Morita therapy continues to influence both Eastern and Western approaches to psychological wellness, emphasizing a balanced, accepting, and action-oriented approach to living.
