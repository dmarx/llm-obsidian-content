Authoritarian Submission

### Authoritarian Submission

**Authoritarian submission** is a core trait of the [[Authoritarian Personality Theory]], characterized by a submissive, uncritical attitude towards idealized moral authorities of the in-group. This concept highlights how individuals with authoritarian personalities tend to obey and defer to figures of authority unquestioningly, valuing obedience over independent thought and critical evaluation.

#### Characteristics

1. **Deference to Authority**: A strong tendency to submit to established authorities within their own group or society.
2. **Uncritical Acceptance**: A lack of critical questioning or skepticism towards the actions and directives of authority figures.
3. **Moral Absolutism**: Belief in the absolute correctness of the in-group's moral and social norms, as dictated by authority figures.
4. **Conformity**: High levels of conformity to societal norms and expectations, particularly those endorsed by authority.

#### Theoretical Foundations

Authoritarian submission is rooted in a combination of psychodynamic, social, and cognitive factors.

##### Psychodynamic Perspective

From a psychodynamic perspective, authoritarian submission can be traced back to early childhood experiences with strict, punitive parenting. According to [[Theodor Adorno]] and his colleagues, such parenting fosters deep-seated feelings of insecurity and hostility in children. To cope, these children develop a strong need for order and authority, which they find reassuring and stabilizing in adulthood. They project their need for control and certainty onto authority figures, whom they obey without question.

##### Social Identity Theory

In the context of [[social identity theory]], individuals with authoritarian submission derive their sense of identity and self-worth from their group membership and adherence to the group's norms. Authority figures represent the embodiment of these norms and values, and submitting to them reinforces the individual's social identity and group cohesion.

##### Cognitive Psychology

Cognitive psychology explains authoritarian submission through mechanisms such as **cognitive dissonance reduction** and **heuristic processing**. Individuals with authoritarian tendencies may experience discomfort when confronted with information that contradicts their beliefs. Submitting to authority helps reduce this discomfort by avoiding conflict and maintaining a consistent worldview. Additionally, heuristic processing allows individuals to rely on simple rules and cues (e.g., "trust authority") rather than engaging in complex, critical thinking.

#### Empirical Evidence

Research on authoritarian submission often utilizes scales and questionnaires to measure this trait. For instance, the **Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA)** scale, developed by [[Bob Altemeyer]], assesses authoritarian submission, authoritarian aggression, and conventionalism. Items related to authoritarian submission might include:

- "People should always support their country, even if the country is in the wrong."
- "Our country needs a powerful leader, in order to destroy the radical and immoral currents prevailing in society today."
- "Obedience and respect for authority are the most important virtues children should learn."

Higher scores on such items indicate a stronger tendency towards authoritarian submission.

#### Implications and Consequences

Authoritarian submission can have significant social and political implications:

1. **Support for Authoritarian Regimes**: Individuals with high levels of authoritarian submission are more likely to support authoritarian leaders and regimes, even when such leaders exhibit undemocratic or oppressive behaviors.
2. **Resistance to Social Change**: These individuals tend to resist social change and progressive movements, viewing them as threats to established norms and authorities.
3. **Prejudice and Discrimination**: Authoritarian submission often correlates with higher levels of prejudice and discrimination against out-groups, as authority figures and in-group norms frequently dictate such biases.

#### Mathematical Modeling

To model authoritarian submission mathematically, we can use decision theory and network theory.

##### Decision Theory

Consider an individual's decision to submit to an authority figure. Let $U(x)$ represent the utility function of an individual with respect to their level of submission $x$:

$$
U(x) = \alpha \cdot \text{Conformity}(x) + \beta \cdot \text{Security}(x) - \gamma \cdot \text{Cognitive Dissonance}(x)
$$

Here, $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ are weights representing the importance of conformity, security, and cognitive dissonance, respectively. For individuals with high authoritarian submission, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are large, and $\gamma$ is small, leading to higher utility from submissive behaviors.

##### Network Theory

In a social network $G = (V, E)$, where $V$ represents individuals and $E$ represents social connections, each node $i \in V$ has a state $\sigma_i \in \{0, 1\}$, where $0$ indicates non-submission and $1$ indicates submission to authority. The update rule for each node can be given by:

$$
\sigma_i(t+1) = \text{sign}\left(\sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} w_{ij} \sigma_j(t) + h \right)
$$

where $\mathcal{N}(i)$ is the set of neighbors of node $i$, $w_{ij}$ are weights representing the influence of node $j$ on node $i$, and $h$ is an external field representing societal influences promoting submission to authority. As $h$ increases or as the influence weights $w_{ij}$ favor submission, the network may transition to a state where most nodes adopt submissive attitudes, similar to phase transitions in physical systems.

### Conclusion

**Authoritarian submission** is a key component of the [[Authoritarian Personality Theory]], highlighting the predisposition of individuals to defer to authority figures uncritically. This trait is shaped by psychodynamic factors, social identity needs, and cognitive processes, and has significant implications for political behavior and social attitudes. Understanding and modeling authoritarian submission can provide insights into the dynamics of authoritarianism in societies.

### Authoritarian Submission and Its Correlation with Prejudice and Discrimination

#### Overview

Authoritarian submission, as defined in the [[Authoritarian Personality Theory]], is the tendency to exhibit a submissive and uncritical attitude toward established authorities and societal norms. This trait often correlates with higher levels of prejudice and discrimination against out-groups. This relationship can be explained through various psychological, social, and cognitive mechanisms.

#### Mechanisms Underlying the Correlation

1. **Normative Influence of Authority Figures**:
    - **Social Learning Theory**: According to [[Albert Bandura]]'s social learning theory, individuals learn behaviors, attitudes, and norms by observing and imitating authority figures. When these figures express or endorse prejudiced views, followers with high levels of authoritarian submission are likely to adopt and internalize these biases.
    - **Legitimization of Prejudice**: Authority figures have the power to legitimize certain attitudes and behaviors. When they sanction or promote discriminatory policies or rhetoric, it provides a normative justification for followers to engage in prejudiced behavior, reducing the moral and social costs associated with such actions.

2. **In-Group Favoritism and Out-Group Hostility**:
    - **Social Identity Theory**: As proposed by [[Henri Tajfel]], individuals derive part of their self-esteem from their group membership. Authoritarian submission reinforces a strong identification with the in-group, often defined by national, ethnic, or ideological lines. This heightened in-group identification is coupled with hostility towards out-groups, which are seen as threats to the in-group's values and status.
    - **Realistic Group Conflict Theory**: Developed by [[Muzafer Sherif]], this theory posits that intergroup prejudice and discrimination arise from competition over scarce resources. Authoritarian submission exacerbates this dynamic by promoting a zero-sum view of social resources, where the prosperity of out-groups is perceived as a direct threat to the in-group.

3. **Cognitive Processes**:
    - **Stereotyping and Heuristic Processing**: Individuals with high authoritarian submission tend to rely on cognitive shortcuts, such as stereotypes, to process social information. Stereotypes simplify complex social realities and reinforce existing prejudices, making it easier for authoritarian individuals to categorize and devalue out-groups.
    - **Confirmation Bias**: Authoritarian individuals exhibit confirmation bias, selectively attending to information that supports their prejudiced views while dismissing or rationalizing contradictory evidence. This cognitive bias reinforces and perpetuates discriminatory attitudes.

4. **Psychodynamic Factors**:
    - **Projection and Scapegoating**: Psychodynamic theories suggest that individuals with authoritarian submission project their own undesirable traits and insecurities onto out-groups. Scapegoating involves attributing societal problems and personal failures to these out-groups, providing a psychological outlet for frustration and aggression.
    - **Defense Mechanisms**: Authoritarian submission is associated with defense mechanisms such as displacement and reaction formation. Displacement involves redirecting negative emotions from a powerful source (e.g., authority figures) to a safer target (e.g., out-groups), while reaction formation entails adopting attitudes opposite to one's unacceptable desires, manifesting in exaggerated hostility towards out-groups.

#### Empirical Evidence

Numerous studies have empirically demonstrated the link between authoritarian submission and prejudice:

1. **Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) Research**: Research using the RWA scale has consistently found that individuals scoring high on authoritarian submission also exhibit higher levels of prejudice against various out-groups, including ethnic minorities, immigrants, and LGBTQ+ individuals.
2. **Cross-Cultural Studies**: Studies conducted across different cultural contexts have shown that authoritarian submission predicts xenophobic attitudes and support for discriminatory policies. For instance, in times of social and economic instability, authoritarian submission increases, leading to a rise in nationalist and exclusionary sentiments.
3. **Experimental Studies**: Laboratory experiments have demonstrated that inducing a sense of threat or uncertainty (conditions that heighten authoritarian submission) leads to increased prejudice and discriminatory behavior. For example, participants primed with mortality salience (awareness of their own death) show stronger support for punitive measures against out-groups.

#### Theoretical Models

To formalize the relationship between authoritarian submission and prejudice, we can employ models from social psychology and network theory.

##### Social Psychology Model

Consider an individual with an authoritarian personality making a decision regarding an out-group member. Let $P$ represent the propensity for prejudice, which is a function of authoritarian submission ($AS$) and influence from authority figures ($A$):

$$
P = \alpha \cdot AS + \beta \cdot A + \gamma \cdot \text{In-group Norms} - \delta \cdot \text{Counter-Evidence}
$$

Where:
- $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, and $\delta$ are weights representing the strength of each factor.
- In-group norms and counter-evidence moderate the relationship between authoritarian submission and prejudice.

##### Network Theory Model

In a social network $G = (V, E)$, where $V$ represents individuals and $E$ represents social connections, each node $i \in V$ has a state $\sigma_i \in \{-1, 1\}$, where $-1$ indicates non-prejudiced and $1$ indicates prejudiced attitudes.

The state update rule for each node can be given by:

$$
\sigma_i(t+1) = \text{sign}\left(\sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} w_{ij} \sigma_j(t) + h \cdot AS_i + \eta \cdot A \right)
$$

Where:
- $\mathcal{N}(i)$ is the set of neighbors of node $i$.
- $w_{ij}$ are weights representing the influence of node $j$ on node $i$.
- $h$ represents the influence of authoritarian submission.
- $\eta$ represents the influence of authority figures.

As the influence of authoritarian submission ($h$) and authority figures ($\eta$) increases, the network may transition to a state where a significant fraction of nodes adopt prejudiced attitudes, similar to phase transitions in physical systems.

### Conclusion

Authoritarian submission is closely linked to higher levels of prejudice and discrimination against out-groups. This relationship is driven by normative influences from authority figures, in-group favoritism, cognitive biases, and psychodynamic mechanisms. Understanding these dynamics can help in developing interventions to reduce prejudice and promote social cohesion.
