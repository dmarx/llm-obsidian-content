title: self-adjoint part of a $c^$-algebra

**USER**

the self-adjoint part of a $C^*$-algebra


**ASSISTANT**

The self-adjoint part of a $C^*$-algebra is a significant concept in functional analysis and operator algebras, particularly in the context of quantum mechanics and mathematical physics.

A $C^*$-algebra $A$ is a complex algebra equipped with a norm and an involution satisfying specific properties that make it a rich structure for studying operators on Hilbert spaces. The involution, denoted by $^*$, maps an element $a$ in $A$ to its adjoint $a^*$.

The self-adjoint part of a $C^*$-algebra consists of all elements $a$ in $A$ that are equal to their own adjoint, that is, $a = a^*$. These elements are analogous to real-valued functions in the sense that they correspond to observable quantities in quantum mechanics.

Key properties of the self-adjoint part of a $C^*$-algebra include:

1. Commutativity: The self-adjoint elements form a real vector space that is closed under the addition and scalar multiplication by real numbers.

2. Jordan Product: The self-adjoint part of a $C^*$-algebra can be endowed with a Jordan algebra structure. This is done by defining a new product $a \circ b = \frac{1}{2}(ab + ba)$, where $ab$ denotes the usual associative product in $A$. This product is commutative and satisfies the Jordan identity, making the self-adjoint part a Jordan algebra.

3. Order Structure: The self-adjoint elements can be partially ordered by defining $a \leq b$ if and only if $b - a$ is a positive element (i.e., there exists some $c$ in $A$ such that $b - a = c^*c$).

Applications of the self-adjoint part of a $C^*$-algebra are diverse, especially in quantum mechanics, where they represent observables. In this context, the spectral theorem states that any self-adjoint operator can be represented as an integral of projection operators, which corresponds to measuring physical quantities. The self-adjoint elements play a crucial role in the formulation of quantum theory, providing the mathematical framework for understanding measurements and states in quantum systems.
