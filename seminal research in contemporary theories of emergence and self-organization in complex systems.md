     - **Contribution**: Highlighted the role of ABM in simulating self-organizing processes and emergent phenomena in various fields, including sociology, economics, and environmental science.

3. **Self-Organized Criticality**

   - **"Self-Organized Criticality: Emergent Complex Behavior in Physical and Biological Systems" by Henrik Jeldtoft Jensen (1998)**
     - **Overview**: Jensen explores the concept of self-organized criticality (SOC), where systems naturally evolve to a critical state characterized by scale-invariant behavior.
     - **Contribution**: Provided a unifying framework for understanding diverse phenomena such as earthquakes, forest fires, and financial market crashes as emergent behaviors resulting from SOC.

   - **"Self-Organized Criticality: An Introduction" by Per Bak (1996)**
     - **Overview**: Bak's book popularized the idea of SOC, demonstrating how it can explain complex patterns observed in nature.
     - **Contribution**: Established SOC as a key concept in complexity science, influencing subsequent research in physics, biology, and economics.

4. **Evolutionary Dynamics and Adaptation**

   - **"The Major Transitions in Evolution" by John Maynard Smith and Eörs Szathmáry (1995)**
     - **Overview**: This work explores the major transitions in the evolution of life, such as the emergence of multicellularity and sociality.
     - **Contribution**: Highlighted how emergent properties at higher levels of organization result from self-organizing processes at lower levels.
