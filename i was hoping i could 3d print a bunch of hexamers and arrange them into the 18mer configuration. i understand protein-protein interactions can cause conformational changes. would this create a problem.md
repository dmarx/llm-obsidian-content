i was hoping I could 3D print a bunch of hexamers and arrange them into the 18mer configuration. I understand protein-protein interactions can cause conformational changes. Would this create a problem for me or should I be fine just sticking the hexamers together to understand how these proteins fit together in the 18meric form?

Creating a 3D-printed model of the hexameric and 18meric structures of citrate synthase from *Synechococcus elongatus* can be a valuable educational and investigative tool to visualize and understand the assembly mechanism. However, there are some key considerations and potential limitations that come with trying to physically model these protein complexes:

1. **Protein Conformation Changes**: In the natural assembly of the protein into the 18meric Sierpiński triangle, slight conformational changes in the protein structure are critical. These changes, which involve rotations and alignments at the molecular level, are essential for the correct formation of interfaces between hexamers. These subtleties may not be fully captured or replicated by static 3D-printed models, which could limit the accuracy of your model in demonstrating how the proteins interact in reality.

2. **Interface Complexity**: The interfaces between the hexamers involve specific interactions at the amino acid level, including essential contacts that stabilize the structure. In your 3D model, replicating these specific interactions (e.g., between residue E6 and H369) might not be feasible without a detailed and dynamic model. Without these interactions, the hexamers might not align correctly to form the precise geometry seen in the 18meric form.

3. **Physical Model Limitations**: A physical model does not flex or change conformation as real proteins might in a cellular environment. This rigidity means that the dynamic nature of protein assembly, including the ability to shift between different oligomeric states under different conditions (such as changes in pH or substrate concentration), won't be demonstrable with a static model.

4. **Educational Value**: Despite these limitations, a 3D-printed model can still be highly educational. It can help in visualizing the overall structure and in understanding how geometric configuration like the 120° angle at hexamer interfaces contributes to the larger assembly.

If you proceed with creating a 3D model, consider focusing on accurately representing the shape and size of the hexamers and their orientation relative to each other to form the 18mer. This approach will help illustrate the fundamental geometric principles underlying the formation of the Sierpiński triangles without needing to replicate the specific protein-protein interactions. For an enhanced model, modifications could be designed to mimic interface interactions using magnets or clips that represent key interaction points, providing a more interactive model that can be manipulated to demonstrate assembly and disassembly.
