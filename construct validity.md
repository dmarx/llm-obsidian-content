# Construct Validity

[[Construct validity]] refers to the degree to which a test measures what it claims, or purports, to measure. It represents the extent to which a measurement tool assesses the theoretical [[construct]] it was designed to evaluate. This form of [[validity]] is essential in [[psychometrics]] and scientific research because it connects observable measurements to their underlying theoretical concepts.

## Mathematical Formalization

Construct validity can be formalized using several statistical approaches:

### Correlation-Based Models

If $X$ represents observed test scores and $\eta$ represents the true underlying construct:

$$r_{X\eta} = \frac{\text{Cov}(X, \eta)}{\sigma_X \sigma_{\eta}}$$

Where:
- $r_{X\eta}$ is the correlation between observed scores and the true construct
- $\text{Cov}(X, \eta)$ is their covariance
- $\sigma_X$ and $\sigma_{\eta}$ are their respective standard deviations

### Factor Analysis Model

Using [[confirmatory factor analysis]] (CFA):

$$X_i = \lambda_i \eta + \epsilon_i$$

Where:
- $X_i$ is the observed score on indicator $i$
- $\lambda_i$ is the factor loading (representing the strength of relationship)
- $\eta$ is the latent construct
- $\epsilon_i$ is measurement error

The proportion of variance in $X_i$ explained by the construct is:

$$R^2 = \frac{\lambda_i^2 \text{Var}(\eta)}{\lambda_i^2 \text{Var}(\eta) + \text{Var}(\epsilon_i)}$$

### Multitrait-Multimethod Matrix

For multiple traits ($t$) measured by multiple methods ($m$), a correlation matrix $\mathbf{R}$ with dimensions $(t \times m) \times (t \times m)$ is analyzed to estimate:

1. **Convergent validity**: High correlations between same trait measured by different methods
2. **Discriminant validity**: Low correlations between different traits regardless of method

## Types of Construct Validity Evidence

### Convergent Validity

Demonstrates that measures theoretically related to the construct show empirical relationships:

$$r_{XY} > 0 \text{ and statistically significant}$$

Where $X$ and $Y$ are different measures of the same construct.

### Discriminant Validity

Shows that measures theoretically unrelated to the construct show minimal empirical relationships:

$$r_{XZ} \approx 0 \text{ and not statistically significant}$$

Where $X$ measures the construct and $Z$ measures an unrelated construct.

### Nomological Validity

Examines whether a measure functions within a [[nomological network]] (system of laws) as theoretically expected:

$$r_{XY} \approx r_{\text{predicted by theory}}$$

Where the relationship between $X$ and $Y$ is predicted by theory.

## Statistical Methods for Assessing Construct Validity

### Factor Analysis

Both [[exploratory factor analysis]] (EFA) and [[confirmatory factor analysis]] (CFA) identify latent variables underlying observed measures:

For EFA, the model is:

$$\mathbf{X} = \mathbf{\Lambda F} + \mathbf{E}$$

Where:
- $\mathbf{X}$ is the vector of observed variables
- $\mathbf{\Lambda}$ is the factor loading matrix
- $\mathbf{F}$ is the vector of common factors
- $\mathbf{E}$ is the vector of unique factors (errors)

### Structural Equation Modeling

[[Structural equation modeling]] (SEM) combines factor analysis with path analysis:

$$\mathbf{\eta} = \mathbf{B\eta} + \mathbf{\Gamma\xi} + \mathbf{\zeta}$$
$$\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{\Lambda_y\eta} + \mathbf{\epsilon}$$
$$\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{\Lambda_x\xi} + \mathbf{\delta}$$

Where:
- $\mathbf{\eta}$ and $\mathbf{\xi}$ are latent endogenous and exogenous variables
- $\mathbf{y}$ and $\mathbf{x}$ are observed endogenous and exogenous variables
- $\mathbf{B}$, $\mathbf{\Gamma}$, $\mathbf{\Lambda_y}$, and $\mathbf{\Lambda_x}$ are coefficient matrices
- $\mathbf{\zeta}$, $\mathbf{\epsilon}$, and $\mathbf{\delta}$ are error terms

### Item Response Theory

[[Item Response Theory]] (IRT) evaluates construct validity by modeling the relationship between latent trait levels and item responses:

$$P(X_{ij} = 1|\theta_i, \mathbf{b}_j) = f(\theta_i, \mathbf{b}_j)$$

Where:
- $P(X_{ij} = 1|\theta_i, \mathbf{b}_j)$ is the probability of correct response
- $\theta_i$ is the latent trait level of person $i$
- $\mathbf{b}_j$ is the vector of item parameters for item $j$
- $f$ is a function such as the logistic or normal ogive

## Threats to Construct Validity

### Construct Underrepresentation

When a measure fails to capture important aspects of the construct:

$$\text{Domain}(\eta) \not\subset \text{Domain}(X)$$

### Construct-Irrelevant Variance

When a measure includes variance attributable to other constructs:

$$\text{Var}(X) = \text{Var}(\eta) + \text{Var}(\text{irrelevant})$$

### Method Variance

Systematic error variance associated with the measurement method rather than the construct:

$$X = \lambda_{\eta}\eta + \lambda_m m + \epsilon$$

Where $m$ represents method factors.

## Advanced Concepts

### Measurement Invariance

[[Measurement invariance]] tests whether a measure's psychometric properties hold across different groups:

1. **Configural invariance**: Same factor structure across groups
2. **Metric invariance**: Equal factor loadings across groups
3. **Scalar invariance**: Equal intercepts across groups
4. **Strict invariance**: Equal error variances across groups

### Ecological Validity

[[Ecological validity]] examines whether test performance corresponds to real-world behavior:

$$r_{\text{test-behavior}} = \frac{\text{Cov}(X_{\text{test}}, Y_{\text{behavior}})}{\sigma_{X_{\text{test}}} \sigma_{Y_{\text{behavior}}}}$$

### Incremental Validity

[[Incremental validity]] assesses whether a measure provides additional information beyond existing measures:

$$\Delta R^2 = R^2_{Y \sim X_1 + X_2} - R^2_{Y \sim X_1}$$

Where $X_2$ is the new measure and $X_1$ represents existing measures.

## Philosophical Considerations

The concept of construct validity connects to deeper philosophical questions about [[measurement theory]], [[operationalism]], and the [[realism-antirealism debate]] regarding unobservable theoretical entities. Some philosophers argue that construct validity represents a pragmatic rather than ontological claim about measurement adequacy.

From a [[philosophy of science]] perspective, construct validity relates to the [[theory-ladenness of observation]] and the challenges of connecting theoretical terms to empirical observations, addressed in [[concept operationalization]] and [[theoretical bridge principles]].
