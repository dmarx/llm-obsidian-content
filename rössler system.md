Rössler System


**ASSISTANT**

The Rössler system is a set of three non-linear ordinary differential equations originally studied by Otto Rössler. It is a well-known example in the field of chaos theory and dynamical systems, often used to illustrate chaotic behavior in continuous-time systems.

### Rössler System Equations

The Rössler system is defined by the following equations:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{dx}{dt} &= -y - z, \\
\frac{dy}{dt} &= x + ay, \\
\frac{dz}{dt} &= b + z(x - c),
\end{aligned}
$$

where \( x, y, z \) are variables that evolve over time, and \( a, b, c \) are parameters that determine the behavior of the system.

### Dynamics of the Rössler System

The behavior of the Rössler system depends on the values of the parameters \( a, b, \) and \( c \). For certain parameter values, the system exhibits chaotic behavior characterized by a strange attractor.

#### Fixed Points

To find the fixed points of the system, we set the right-hand sides of the equations to zero:

$$
\begin{aligned}
-y - z &= 0, \\
x + ay &= 0, \\
b + z(x - c) &= 0.
\end{aligned}
$$

Solving these equations, we get the fixed points:

$$
(x^*, y^*, z^*) = \left( -a \frac{b}{c}, a \frac{b}{c}, \frac{b}{c} \right).
$$

#### Linear Stability Analysis

To analyze the stability of these fixed points, we linearize the system around each fixed point by computing the Jacobian matrix:

$$
J = \begin{pmatrix}
\frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial y} & \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial z} \\
\frac{\partial f_2}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial f_2}{\partial y} & \frac{\partial f_2}{\partial z} \\
\frac{\partial f_3}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial f_3}{\partial y} & \frac{\partial f_3}{\partial z}
\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & -1 & -1 \\
1 & a & 0 \\
z & 0 & x - c
\end{pmatrix}.
$$

Evaluating the Jacobian at the fixed point \(\left( -a \frac{b}{c}, a \frac{b}{c}, \frac{b}{c} \right)\), we obtain:

$$
J = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & -1 & -1 \\
1 & a & 0 \\
\frac{b}{c} & 0 & -a
\end{pmatrix}.
```

The eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix determine the stability of the fixed point. The fixed point is stable if all eigenvalues have negative real parts and unstable if at least one eigenvalue has a positive real part.

### Chaotic Behavior and Strange Attractor

For certain parameter values, the Rössler system exhibits a strange attractor, a fractal structure in the phase space that shows sensitive dependence on initial conditions, a hallmark of chaotic systems. Common parameter values that produce chaotic behavior are:

$$
a = 0.2, \quad b = 0.2, \quad c = 5.7.
```

The resulting attractor can be visualized in the \((x, y, z)\) phase space, showing a twisted ribbon-like structure.

### Shil'nikov Homoclinic Bifurcation

The Rössler system can also exhibit Shil'nikov homoclinic bifurcations, which are associated with the existence of [[homoclinic orbits]] to saddle-focus equilibria and the onset of chaos. For such bifurcations, the system parameters must satisfy the Shil'nikov condition:

$$
\frac{|\lambda_s|}{\lambda_{u1}} < 1,
$$

where \(\lambda_s\) is the stable eigenvalue, and \(\lambda_{u1} \pm i \lambda_{u2}\) are the unstable complex conjugate eigenvalues of the saddle-focus equilibrium.

### Numerical Simulation

Numerical simulations are commonly used to study the Rössler system. Techniques like the Runge-Kutta method are used to integrate the system of differential equations and visualize the trajectories in phase space. Here's a simple example of a numerical integration using Python:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.integrate import solve_ivp
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Rössler system parameters
a = 0.2
b = 0.2
c = 5.7

# Rössler system equations
def rossler(t, state):
    x, y, z = state
    dxdt = -y - z
    dydt = x + a * y
    dzdt = b + z * (x - c)
    return [dxdt, dydt, dzdt]

# Initial conditions
initial_state = [1, 1, 1]

# Time span
t_span = (0, 100)
t_eval = np.linspace(*t_span, 10000)

# Solve the system
sol = solve_ivp(rossler, t_span, initial_state, t_eval=t_eval, method='RK45')

# Plot the attractor
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')
ax.plot(sol.y[0], sol.y[1], sol.y[2])
ax.set_xlabel('x')
ax.set_ylabel('y')
ax.set_zlabel('z')
plt.show()
```

### Conclusion

The Rössler system is a prototypical example of a chaotic dynamical system. It exhibits rich dynamics, including fixed points, periodic orbits, and chaotic attractors, making it a valuable model for studying nonlinear phenomena and chaos theory.
