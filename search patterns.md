Search Patterns


**ASSISTANT**

**Search patterns** are systematic methods used in search and rescue (SAR) operations to ensure comprehensive and efficient coverage of a search area. The primary goal of search patterns is to maximize the probability of detecting the target (whether it be a missing person, aircraft, ship, etc.) while minimizing the time and resources expended. Selecting the appropriate search pattern depends on various factors, including the type of target, the search environment, the available resources, and the level of uncertainty about the target's location.

### Common Search Patterns in SAR Operations

1. **Parallel Track Search (Parallel Sweep)**
   
   - **Description**: The parallel track search is one of the most common search patterns used when a large search area needs to be covered systematically. Searchers move along parallel lines, usually oriented in the direction of the prevailing drift or along the most likely path of the target.
   
   - **Application**: This pattern is ideal for large, relatively open areas such as oceans, fields, or deserts where the target's location is broadly uncertain. It is effective in covering the area thoroughly but can be time-consuming depending on the width of the search pattern and the size of the area.
   
   - **Advantages**:
     - Provides systematic coverage of a large area.
     - Easy to plan and execute.
   
   - **Disadvantages**:
     - Less efficient in areas with many obstacles (e.g., forests, urban environments).
     - Time-consuming for very large search areas.

   - **Implementation**: In a parallel track search, the search area is divided into strips or lanes of equal width. Searchers (on foot, in vehicles, aircraft, or boats) move along these strips in parallel paths, maintaining consistent spacing to ensure all areas are covered. The spacing between tracks depends on factors such as visibility, terrain, and search speed.

   - **Mathematical Basis**:
     - If the width of each strip is \( W \) and the detection range is \( D \), then the spacing between adjacent tracks is typically set to be equal to or less than \( D \). The probability of detection (POD) is higher when \( W \leq D \).

2. **Creeping Line Search**

   - **Description**: In a creeping line search, searchers follow parallel tracks like in a parallel track search, but the pattern is oriented perpendicular to the direction of movement or the drift of the target. The pattern is used when there is a higher probability of the target being located near one line of the search area.
   
   - **Application**: This pattern is useful when the target's last known position or probable path suggests a higher likelihood of its presence near a specific line, such as the shoreline or along a suspected route of travel.
   
   - **Advantages**:
     - More focused on areas where the target is more likely to be found.
     - Useful when the target is expected to be aligned with a particular geographic feature.
   
   - **Disadvantages**:
     - May not cover as much area as efficiently as a parallel track search if the initial assumptions are incorrect.
   
   - **Implementation**: The search area is divided into narrow lanes perpendicular to the drift or suspected travel direction. The searchers move along each lane in turn, "creeping" forward along the axis of the lane's orientation.

3. **Expanding Square Search (Expanding Box)**

   - **Description**: An expanding square search starts from a central point and progressively expands outwards in an increasing square pattern. This pattern is useful when the searcher has a reasonable initial position of the target but low confidence in the accuracy of that position.
   
   - **Application**: Used when the target is likely to be near a specific point, such as a last known position (LKP) or a distress signal location. This
