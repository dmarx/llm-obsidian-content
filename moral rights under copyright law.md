moral rights under copyright law


**ASSISTANT**

**Moral rights** under copyright law refer to the personal rights of authors and creators to protect their personal and reputational interests in their works. Unlike economic rights, which concern the financial exploitation of a work, moral rights are primarily about maintaining the integrity of the work and the creator's connection to it. These rights are recognized in various jurisdictions, with significant provisions under the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]]. Here’s a comprehensive overview of moral rights, including their types, legal basis, implications, and examples.

## Types of Moral Rights

### Right of Paternity

- **Definition**: The right of paternity allows authors to claim authorship of their works and to be credited as the creators.
- **Implications**: Authors can ensure proper attribution and object to false attribution where someone else is wrongly credited as the author.

### Right of Integrity

- **Definition**: The [[right of integrity]] allows authors to prevent any distortion, mutilation, modification, or other derogatory actions concerning their works that would be prejudicial to their honor or reputation.
- **Implications**: Authors can object to unauthorized alterations and ensure that their works are presented in a manner that respects their original intent and integrity.

### Right of Disclosure

- **Definition**: The right of disclosure allows authors to control the first public release of their works.
- **Implications**: Authors can decide when and how their works are made available to the public.

### Right of Withdrawal

- **Definition**: The right of withdrawal allows authors to retract their works from the public domain if they no longer reflect the author's views.
- **Implications**: Authors may withdraw their works from circulation, often requiring compensation to users who have acquired rights in the work.

## Legal Basis

### Berne Convention

- **Article 6bis**: The Berne Convention explicitly provides for the right of paternity and the [[right of integrity]]. These rights exist independently of the author's economic rights and remain with the author even after the transfer of those economic rights.

### National Laws

#### France

- **Droit Moral**: French law provides comprehensive protection of moral rights, including the rights of paternity, integrity, disclosure, and withdrawal. These rights are perpetual, inalienable, and imprescriptible (cannot be waived or transferred).

#### United States

- **Visual Artists Rights Act (VARA)**: VARA grants limited moral rights, specifically to authors of visual works, including rights of paternity and integrity. VARA does not cover other types of works and is limited in scope compared to European protections.

#### United Kingdom

- **Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988**: UK law recognizes moral rights, including the right of paternity, integrity, and the right to object to false attribution.

### Duration of Moral Rights

- **Lifespan**: The duration of moral rights varies by jurisdiction. In many countries, these rights last for the lifetime of the author plus an additional period (e.g., 70 years post-mortem auctoris in the EU).

## Implications

### Artistic Integrity

- **Protection of Works**: Moral rights help maintain the integrity of artistic and literary works, ensuring they are not distorted or misrepresented.
- **Preservation of Reputation**: These rights protect the personal and professional reputation of creators by allowing them to control how their works are used and presented.

### Legal and Commercial Impact

- **Contractual Agreements**: Moral rights can impact contractual agreements, especially where modifications to a work are concerned. Contracts often need to include clauses that respect these rights.
- **Litigation**: Violations of moral rights can lead to legal disputes, where authors seek remedies such as injunctions or damages.

## Examples

### Literature

- **Editing and Attribution**: An author may object to unauthorized edits to their manuscript that change its meaning or presentation, and they can demand proper attribution in all editions of their book.

### Visual Arts

- **Alteration of Artwork**: An artist may prevent the unauthorized alteration of their painting, such as cropping or overpainting, and ensure their name is properly displayed alongside the artwork.

### Music

- **Adaptations and Remixes**: A composer can object to unauthorized adaptations or remixes of their music that alter the original composition in a way that damages their reputation.

### Film and Theatre

- **Directorial Credits**: A film director can ensure they are credited as the director in all promotional materials and object to any editing that significantly changes the film’s content without their consent.

## Case Studies

### Gilliam v. American Broadcasting Companies, Inc.

- **Background**: This 1976 case involved members of Monty Python suing ABC for broadcasting heavily edited versions of their TV shows.
- **Outcome**: The court recognized the importance of proper attribution and the right of the authors to be credited for their original work, thus upholding their right of paternity and integrity.

### Visual Artists Rights Act (VARA) Cases

- **Carter v. Helmsley-Spear, Inc. (1995)**: Artists successfully prevented the destruction of their sculptures in a commercial building, asserting their [[right of integrity]] under VARA.
