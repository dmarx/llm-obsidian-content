    - Projects like the redevelopment of the harborfront and the creation of urban parks enhance the city's livability.

6. **Water Management and Climate Adaptation**:
    - The city has implemented innovative solutions for water management and climate adaptation, such as green roofs, permeable pavements, and rainwater harvesting systems.
    - These measures help mitigate the effects of heavy rainfall and flooding, making the city more resilient to climate change.

7. **Citizen Involvement**:
    - Public participation is a key component of Copenhagen's urban planning process. The city engages residents through public consultations, workshops, and online platforms.
    - Citizen input helps shape urban development projects and ensures that they meet the needs and preferences of the community.
