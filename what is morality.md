title: what is morality

**USER**

What is morality? Where does it come from, and how does it work? And how and why do moral values vary, between individuals, and across cultures? The theory of ‘morality as cooperation’ (MAC) argues that morality is best understood as a collection of biological and cultural solutions to the problems of cooperation recurrent in human social life. MAC draws on evolutionary game theory to argue that, because there are many types of cooperation, there will be many types of morality. These include: family values, group loyalty, reciprocity, heroism, deference, fairness and property rights. Previous research suggests that these seven types of morality are evolutionarily-ancient, psychologically-distinct, and cross-culturally universal. The goal of this project is to further develop and test MAC, and explore its implications for traditional moral philosophy. Current research is examining the genetic and psychological architecture of these seven types of morality, as well as using phylogenetic methods to investigate how morals are culturally transmitted. Future work will seek to extend MAC to incorporate sexual morality and environmental ethics. In this way, the project aims to place the study of morality on a firm scientific foundation.

### What is Morality?

Morality refers to principles and values concerning the distinction between right and wrong or good and bad behavior. It encompasses the set of rules, norms, and standards that govern human conduct within societies and groups. These moral codes dictate what is considered acceptable or unacceptable behavior and are fundamental in shaping interactions and maintaining social cohesion.

### Origins of Morality

The origins of morality are complex and multifaceted, encompassing both biological and cultural dimensions. Morality likely evolved as a mechanism to facilitate cooperation and social living. From an evolutionary perspective, moral behaviors can be seen as adaptive strategies that enhance the survival and reproductive success of individuals within a group. This perspective is supported by the theory of ‘Morality as Cooperation’ (MAC).

### Morality as Cooperation (MAC)

The theory of ‘Morality as Cooperation’ (MAC) posits that morality is best understood as a suite of biological and cultural solutions to recurrent problems of cooperation in human social life. According to MAC, there are various types of cooperation, each giving rise to different moral norms. These types of cooperation include:

- **Family values**: Ensuring the well-being and survival of kin.
- **Group loyalty**: Promoting solidarity and cohesion within a group.
- **Reciprocity**: Facilitating mutually beneficial exchanges.
- **Heroism**: Valuing acts of bravery that protect the group.
- **Deference**: Respecting authority and social hierarchies.
- **Fairness**: Ensuring equitable treatment and justice.
- **Property rights**: Respecting ownership and territorial boundaries.

### Evolutionary and Psychological Basis

Research suggests that these seven types of morality are:
- **Evolutionarily ancient**: They have deep roots in our evolutionary history.
- **Psychologically distinct**: Each type of morality engages different cognitive and emotional processes.
- **Cross-culturally universal**: These moral norms are found in diverse cultures around the world, suggesting a common underlying basis.

### Variation in Moral Values

Moral values vary between individuals and across cultures due to several factors:
- **Genetic differences**: Variations in genetic makeup can influence moral reasoning and behavior.
- **Cultural transmission**: Moral norms are transmitted through social learning, leading to cultural variations.
- **Environmental factors**: Different ecological and social environments can shape the development and expression of moral values.

### Current and Future Research

Current research on MAC focuses on:
- **Genetic and psychological architecture**: Investigating the biological and cognitive underpinnings of the seven types of morality.
- **Phylogenetic methods**: Studying how moral norms are transmitted and evolve culturally.

Future research aims to extend MAC to include:
- **Sexual morality**: Exploring moral norms related to sexual behavior.
- **Environmental ethics**: Investigating moral values concerning environmental stewardship.

### Implications for Traditional Moral Philosophy

By grounding the study of morality in scientific research, MAC provides a robust framework for understanding moral values and behaviors. It offers insights into the evolutionary and cultural dynamics that shape moral systems and has the potential to inform debates in traditional moral philosophy, particularly those concerning the nature and origins of moral values.

### Conclusion

The theory of ‘Morality as Cooperation’ places the study of morality on a firm scientific foundation, integrating insights from evolutionary biology, psychology, and cultural anthropology. By examining the genetic, psychological, and cultural aspects of morality, MAC aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how and why moral values arise and vary across individuals and cultures.
