## Lyapunov Function

### Introduction

A Lyapunov function is a scalar function used in the analysis of the stability of equilibrium points in dynamical systems. Named after the Russian mathematician Aleksandr Lyapunov, this concept is pivotal in both linear and nonlinear stability analysis. The Lyapunov function serves as an analogy to potential energy in physical systems and helps determine whether perturbations to an equilibrium state decay over time or grow, leading the system away from equilibrium.

### Definition

A Lyapunov function \( V(x) \) for a dynamical system \( \dot{x} = f(x) \) is a continuously differentiable scalar function \( V: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R} \) that satisfies the following conditions:

1. **Positive Definite**: \( V(x) > 0 \) for all \( x \neq x^* \) and \( V(x^*) = 0 \).
2. **Negative Definite Derivative**: The time derivative of \( V(x) \) along the trajectories of the system, denoted by \( \dot{V}(x) = \frac{dV}{dt} \), must be negative definite, i.e., \( \dot{V}(x) < 0 \) for all \( x \neq x^* \).

### Lyapunov Stability Theorems

#### Lyapunov's Direct Method

For a system \( \dot{x} = f(x) \):

1. **Lyapunov Stability**:
   - If there exists a Lyapunov function \( V(x) \) such that \( V(x) \) is positive definite and \( \dot{V}(x) \) is negative semi-definite (\( \dot{V}(x) \leq 0 \)), then the equilibrium point \( x^* \) is Lyapunov stable.

2. **Asymptotic Stability**:
   - If there exists a Lyapunov function \( V(x) \) such that \( V(x) \) is positive definite and \( \dot{V}(x) \) is negative definite (\( \dot{V}(x) < 0 \)), then the equilibrium point \( x^* \) is asymptotically stable.

3. **Exponential Stability**:
   - If there exists a Lyapunov function \( V(x) \) such that \( V(x) \) is positive definite and \( \dot{V}(x) \leq -cV(x) \) for some positive constant \( c \), then the equilibrium point \( x^* \) is exponentially stable.

### Constructing a Lyapunov Function

Constructing a Lyapunov function can be challenging and often requires insight into the specific system being studied. There is no general procedure for finding a Lyapunov function, but common methods include:

1. **Energy-Based Methods**: In physical systems, the total energy (kinetic + potential) is often a suitable Lyapunov function.
2. **Quadratic Functions**: For linear systems, quadratic functions of the form \( V(x) = x^T P x \) (where \( P \) is a positive definite matrix) are frequently used.
3. **Control Lyapunov Functions**: In control theory, a Lyapunov function may be designed to incorporate control inputs to stabilize the system.

### Example: Linear System

Consider the linear system:

$$
\dot{x} = Ax
$$

where \( x \in \mathbb{R}^n \) and \( A \) is an \( n \times n \) matrix. To analyze the stability of the equilibrium point \( x^* = 0 \), we choose a quadratic Lyapunov function:

$$
V(x) = x^T P x
$$

where \( P \) is a positive definite matrix.

#### Steps:

1. **Compute the Time Derivative**:
   \[
   \dot{V}(x) = \frac{d}{dt}(x^T P x) = \dot{x}^T P x + x^T P \dot{x}
   \]
   Since \( \dot{x} = Ax \):
   \[
   \dot{V}(x) = (Ax)^T P x + x^T P (Ax) = x^T A^T P x + x^T P A x = x^T (A^T P + P A) x
   \]

2. **Check Negative Definiteness**:
   - If \( A^T P + P A \) is negative definite, then \( \dot{V}(x) \) is negative definite, and the system is asymptotically stable.

### Example: Nonlinear System

Consider the nonlinear system:

$$
\dot{x}_1 = x_2
$$
$$
\dot{x}_2 = -x_1 - x_2^3
$$

To analyze the stability of the equilibrium point \( (x_1^*, x_2^*) = (0, 0) \), we choose a Lyapunov function:

$$
V(x) = \frac{1}{2}(x_1^2 + x_2^2)
$$

#### Steps:

1. **Compute the Time Derivative**:
   \[
   \dot{V}(x) = \frac{\partial V}{\partial x_1} \dot{x}_1 + \frac{\partial V}{\partial x_2} \dot{x}_2 = x_1 x_2 + x_2 (-x_1 - x_2^3) = x_1 x_2 - x_1 x_2 - x_2^4 = -x_2^4
   \]

2. **Analyze the Sign**:
   \[
   \dot{V}(x) = -x_2^4 \leq 0
   \]
   Since \( \dot{V}(x) \) is negative semi-definite, the equilibrium point \( (0, 0) \) is Lyapunov stable.

### Conclusion

A Lyapunov function is a powerful tool in stability analysis, providing a method to determine the stability of equilibrium points in dynamical systems. By constructing a function that behaves like potential energy and analyzing its derivative along system trajectories, one can infer stability properties without explicitly solving the differential equations.
