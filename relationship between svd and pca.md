relationship between SVD and PCA


**ASSISTANT**

The relationship between [[Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)|SVD]] and [[Principal Component Analysis (PCA)|PCA]] is profound and direct, making SVD an essential mathematical technique in PCA's implementation. PCA is a widely used statistical method for dimensionality reduction in data analysis, which involves projecting high-dimensional data onto a lower-dimensional subspace where the variance of the data is maximized. SVD provides the mathematical foundation to perform this reduction optimally.

### Mathematical Connection

The starting point for PCA is a data matrix $X$ of size $n \times p$, where $n$ represents the number of data points, and $p$ represents the number of variables. The goal of PCA is to extract the most important features of the data, which are directions in feature space along which the data varies the most. These directions correspond to the principal components (PCs) of the data.

1. **Centering the Data**:
   Typically, PCA begins by centering the data matrix $X$ by subtracting the mean of each column from the respective column entries. This ensures the data is centered around the origin, which is essential for finding the directions of maximum variance.

2. **Covariance Matrix Computation**:
   The next step in PCA involves computing the covariance matrix of the centered data matrix $X$, denoted as $C$. Mathematically, it's represented as:
   $$ C = \frac{1}{n-1} X^T X $$

3. **Eigen Decomposition of the Covariance Matrix**:
   PCA seeks to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix $C$. The eigenvectors represent the directions of the principal components, and the eigenvalues indicate the variance of the data along these directions.

4. **Using SVD**:
   Hereâ€™s where SVD comes into play. Instead of directly decomposing the covariance matrix, one can apply SVD to the centered data matrix $X$:
   $$ X = U \Sigma V^T $$
   From this decomposition, $X^T X$ (which forms the basis of the covariance matrix) can be expressed as:
   $$ X^T X = (U \Sigma V^T)^T (U \Sigma V^T) = V \Sigma^T \Sigma V^T $$
   Since $X^T X = V \Sigma^2 V^T$, the matrix $V$ contains the eigenvectors of $X^T X$, and the entries of $\Sigma^2$ (divided by $n-1$) are its eigenvalues. Hence, the columns of $V$ are the principal components, and $\Sigma^2 / (n-1)$ provides the variance explained by each component.

### Geometric and Practical Implications

The use of SVD in PCA has practical and computational benefits:

- **Stability and Efficiency**: SVD is numerically more stable and efficient, especially for large datasets, compared to directly computing the eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix.
- **Reduced Computational Cost**: If $n \ll p$ (more features than samples), calculating $X^T X$ via SVD avoids dealing with a large $p \times p$ matrix directly.
- **Interpretation**: The singular values in $\Sigma$ give direct insight into the amount of variance each principal component captures from the original data.

In summary, SVD not only simplifies the computation of PCA but also enhances its interpretation, providing a clear picture of how data can be projected onto a lower-dimensional space that captures the most critical features of the dataset.
