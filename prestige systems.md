### Prestige Systems

**Prestige systems** are a type of progression mechanic often used in games to extend their replayability and provide additional challenges for advanced players. After reaching a certain level of progression, players can choose to reset their progress in exchange for prestige points, exclusive rewards, or enhanced abilities. This system encourages continued engagement by offering long-term goals and incremental benefits.

#### Key Components of Prestige Systems

1. **Prestige Levels**: After reaching the maximum level or completing the main progression path, players can enter a prestige level, resetting their progress but gaining new prestige ranks.

2. **Rewards**: Prestige rewards can include cosmetic items, unique titles, special abilities, and enhancements that are not available through the regular progression path.

3. **Incremental Benefits**: Each prestige level can provide incremental benefits, such as increased experience gain, better loot, or additional skill points, making subsequent progressions easier or more rewarding.

4. **Challenges**: Prestige systems often introduce new challenges, higher difficulty levels, or additional content that becomes accessible only after prestiging.

#### Benefits of Prestige Systems

1. **Replayability**: By resetting progress and offering new rewards, prestige systems motivate players to continue playing and replaying the game.

2. **Long-term Engagement**: Prestige systems provide long-term goals that keep players engaged beyond the initial progression path.

3. **Enhanced Challenge**: New challenges and increased difficulty levels provide a fresh experience and test the skills of advanced players.

4. **Status and Recognition**: Achieving high prestige levels can confer status and recognition within the player community, fostering a sense of accomplishment and pride.

#### Examples of Prestige Systems

1. **"Call of Duty"**: The Call of Duty series features a well-known prestige system where players can reset their rank and unlock special emblems, additional custom class slots, and other rewards upon prestiging.

2. **"Diablo III"**: Diablo IIIâ€™s Paragon system allows players to continue earning experience points and gaining Paragon levels after reaching the maximum character level. Each Paragon level grants points that can be used to enhance character attributes.

3. **"World of Warcraft"**: The Honor system in World of Warcraft allows players to reset their honor rank and gain prestige levels, unlocking exclusive mounts, titles, and other rewards.

#### Mathematical Formalization of Prestige Systems

Mathematical models help design and balance prestige systems to ensure they provide meaningful progression and rewards. Here are some aspects of formalizing prestige systems:

1. **Experience Points (XP) and Progression**: The XP required for each level and the benefits gained from prestiging can be modeled using functions that ensure a balanced progression curve.

$$
XP_{required}(n) = a \cdot b^n
$$

where \( n \) is the level, \( a \) is a base XP value, and \( b \) is a growth factor.

2. **Prestige Points**: Players earn prestige points \( P_p \) upon prestiging, which can be modeled as:

$$
P_p = f(P)
$$

where \( P \) is the player's progress before prestiging and \( f \) is a function that determines the prestige points based on the player's achievements.

3. **Reward Functions**: The rewards for each prestige level can be modeled to ensure they provide incremental benefits and incentivize further progression:

$$
R(p) = g(p)
$$

where \( p \) is the prestige level and \( g \) is a reward function that determines the rewards based on the prestige level.

#### Example: Formalizing a Simple Prestige System

Consider a game where players can prestige after reaching level 50. Upon prestiging, players reset to level 1 but gain prestige points and enhanced abilities. The XP required for each level is modeled by:

$$
XP_{required}(n) = 100 \cdot 1.2^n
$$

The prestige points earned upon prestiging can be defined as:

$$
P_p = 10 \cdot \log(L)
$$

where \( L \) is the level at which the player prestiges (e.g., 50).

The reward function for each prestige level can be modeled as:

$$
R(p) = 5 \cdot p
$$

where \( p \) is the prestige level, and each prestige level grants an additional 5% experience gain bonus.

#### Prestige System Flow

1. **Initial Progression**: Players progress through levels, gaining XP and unlocking abilities.
2. **Reaching Maximum Level**: Upon reaching level 50, players can choose to prestige.
3. **Prestiging**: Players reset to level 1, gain prestige points, and receive enhanced abilities or rewards.
4. **Post-Prestige Progression**: Players progress again, with incremental benefits from their prestige levels making the journey easier or more rewarding.

#### Conclusion

Prestige systems provide a dynamic and engaging way to extend the lifespan of a game by offering players additional challenges, rewards, and long-term goals. By mathematically formalizing these systems, game designers can create balanced and motivating progression paths that keep players invested and continuously striving for new achievements. This approach ensures that the game remains engaging and rewarding even for the most dedicated players.
