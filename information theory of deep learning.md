connected hidden layers.

### Estimating the Mutual Information of the Layers

We calculate the mutual information between each layer and the input and output variables. The neurons' arctan output activations were binned into equal intervals, and the discrete values were used to calculate the joint distributions over the input patterns.

### The Dynamics of the Training by Stochastic Gradient Descent

We plot $I(X; T_i)$ and $I(T_i; Y)$ for each layer for different randomized initializations and training samples. The layers follow similar paths during optimization and converge to nearby points in the information plane.

### The Two Optimization Phases in the Information Plane

The optimization has two phases: a drift phase with a rapid increase in $I(T; Y)$ and a diffusion phase where the gradients behave like Gaussian noise, reducing $I(X; T)$ and compressing the representation.

### The Computational Benefit of the Hidden Layers

Adding hidden layers dramatically reduces the number of training epochs for good generalization. The deeper layers compress faster, and the compression is more efficient with more layers.

### Convergence to the Information Bottleneck Bound

The DNN layers' encoder-decoder distributions satisfy the IB self-consistent equations, converging to the IB theoretical bounds. This is evidenced by the layers' information values lying close to the IB information curve.

### Evolution of the Layers with Training Sample Size

The effect of training sample size on the layers in the information plane shows that with increasing training size, the layers' label information $I(T; Y)$ improves and gets closer to the IB bound.

## Discussion

Our analysis and experiments demonstrate that visualizing DNNs in the information plane reveals new insights into the inner workings of deep learning. The distinct phases of the SGD optimization explain the ERM and representation compression trajectories of the layers. The stochastic nature of SGD contributes to the generation of efficient internal representations through compression by diffusion. This understanding can lead to more efficient training algorithms and a deeper comprehension of the success of deep learning.

## Information Theory of Deep Learning

In the context of supervised learning, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) aim to find effective representations of input data that enable accurate predictions of target labels. Information theory provides a powerful framework for understanding and optimizing these representations. The key concepts include mutual information, the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, and the Data Processing Inequality (DPI).

### Mutual Information

Mutual information quantifies the amount of information shared between two random variables. Given two random variables, $X$ and $Y$, with a joint distribution $p(x, y)$, the mutual information $I(X; Y)$ is defined as:

$$
I(X; Y) = D_{KL}[p(x, y) \parallel p(x)p(y)] = \sum_{x \in X, y \in Y} p(x, y) \log \left( \frac{p(x, y)}{p(x)p(y)} \right)
$$

It can also be expressed in terms of entropy:

$$
I(X; Y) = H(X) - H(X|Y) = H(Y) - H(Y|X)
$$

Here, $H(X)$ is the entropy of $X$, and $H(X|Y)$ is the conditional entropy of $X$ given $Y$.

### Information Bottleneck Principle

The Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, proposed by [[Naftali Tishby]], provides a theoretical framework for finding compressed representations of the input that retain relevant information about the output. In a DNN, each layer transforms the input data into successive representations. The IB principle helps in optimizing these transformations.

The IB method aims to find a compressed representation $T$ of the input $X$ that retains as much information as possible about the output $Y$. This is formulated as the following optimization problem:

$$
\min_{p(t|x)} \left[ I(X; T) - \beta I(T; Y) \right]
$$

where $\beta$ is a tradeoff parameter. The solution to this problem involves finding an optimal encoder $p(t|x)$ and decoder $p(y|t)$ that satisfy the following self-consistent equations:

$$
p(t|x) = \frac{p(t)}{Z(x; \beta)} \exp(-\beta D_{KL}[p(y|x) \parallel p(y|t)])
$$

$$
p(t) = \sum_x p(t|x)p(x)
$$

$$
p(y|t) = \sum_x p(y|x)p(x|t)
$$

where $Z(x; \beta)$ is a normalization function.

### Data Processing Inequality

The Data Processing Inequality (DPI) is a fundamental result in information theory. It states that for any three random variables $X \to Y \to Z$ forming a Markov chain, the mutual information decreases along the chain:

$$
I(X; Y) \ge I(X; Z)
$$

In the context of DNNs, this implies that as data is processed through successive layers, the mutual information with the input can only decrease or remain the same. This provides a theoretical basis for understanding the flow of information through the network.

### Visualizing DNNs in the Information Plane

The Information Plane is a conceptual tool for visualizing the behavior of DNNs. Each layer in a DNN can be characterized by its mutual information with the input $X$ and the output $Y$. Plotting these mutual information values for each layer provides insight into the network's learning dynamics.

For a DNN with $K$ layers, where $T_i$ denotes the $i$-th hidden layer, the information plane plots $I(X; T_i)$ versus $I(T_i; Y)$. The layers form a unique information path that adheres to the DPI:

$$
I(X; Y) \ge I(T_1; Y) \ge I(T_2; Y) \ge \ldots \ge I(T_K; Y) \ge I(\hat{Y}; Y)
$$

$$
H(X) \ge I(X; T_1) \ge I(X; T_2) \ge \ldots \ge I(X; T_K) \ge I(X; \hat{Y})
$$

This visualization helps in understanding how information is preserved or compressed at each layer during training.

### Stochastic Gradient Descent and Information Bottleneck

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is the primary optimization method used to train DNNs. Analyzing SGD in the context of the Information Bottleneck provides insights into the training dynamics. Typically, SGD undergoes two distinct phases:

1. **Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) Phase:** During this phase, the network rapidly reduces training error, increasing the mutual information $I(T; Y)$ for each layer.

2. **Representation Compression Phase:** Once the training error becomes small, SGD transitions to a phase where the network compresses the representation, reducing $I(X; T)$ while preserving $I(T; Y)$. This phase is characterized by high stochasticity in the gradients, leading to a diffusive process that maximizes the entropy of the weights subject to the error constraint.

### Conclusion

Information theory provides a powerful framework for understanding the inner workings of DNNs. By analyzing DNNs in the Information Plane and employing the Information Bottleneck principle, we gain valuable insights into the optimization process and the efficiency of representations learned by the network. These insights can lead to improved training algorithms and a deeper understanding of why deep learning works so well.
