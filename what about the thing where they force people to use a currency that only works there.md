what about the thing where they force people to use a currency that only works there


**ASSISTANT**

Dave & Buster's employs a unique business tactic where they require customers to use a proprietary currency, known as Power Cards, to play games and participate in various activities. This strategy involves several layers that contribute to both operational efficiency and revenue maximization. Hereâ€™s an in-depth look at how this tactic works and its strategic benefits:

### Proprietary Currency: Power Cards

#### 1. **Revenue Generation and Upfront Cash Flow**
When customers purchase Power Cards, they are essentially buying credits that can be used within the venue.

- **Upfront Payment**: Customers pay for game credits in advance, which provides immediate cash flow to the business.
- **Non-Refundable**: Credits are typically non-refundable, ensuring that once the money is spent on a Power Card, it stays within the company.

#### 2. **Increased Spending and Retention**
By converting cash into a proprietary currency, customers may spend more than they originally intended.

- **Psychological Effect**: Using a proprietary currency can psychologically distance the customer from the actual amount of money being spent, leading to higher expenditure.
- **Incentives and Bonuses**: Dave & Buster's often offers bonus credits when customers purchase higher denominations of Power Cards, encouraging larger purchases.

#### 3. **Customer Loyalty and Return Visits**
Power Cards are designed to encourage repeat visits and build customer loyalty.

- **Remaining Balance**: Customers often leave with unused credits on their Power Cards, incentivizing them to return to use the remaining balance.
- **Promotional Offers**: Regular promotions tied to Power Cards, such as extra credits on specific days or special events, further encourage repeat visits.

#### 4. **Operational Efficiency**
Using a centralized, digital currency system simplifies operations in several ways.

- **Streamlined Transactions**: Digital transactions reduce the need for handling cash and simplify the payment process at gaming machines and kiosks.
- **Data Collection**: Power Cards can be tracked, allowing Dave & Buster's to gather data on customer spending habits and preferences, which can be used for targeted marketing and inventory management.

#### 5. **Reduced Fraud and Theft**
A proprietary currency system can help mitigate risks associated with cash handling.

- **Security**: Digital transactions reduce the risk of cash theft and fraud by employees or patrons.
- **Controlled Use**: Power Cards are specifically designed to work only within Dave & Buster's locations, preventing their misuse elsewhere.

#### 6. **Pricing Flexibility and Revenue Management**
Dave & Buster's can adjust the value of credits and the cost of games independently of actual currency values.

- **Dynamic Pricing**: They can offer different credit prices for games based on time of day, day of the week, or special promotions without changing the actual dollar amount.
- **Bundling Offers**: Bundling game credits with food and beverage packages can create attractive deals that encourage higher overall spending.

### Strategic Benefits

- **Customer Engagement**: The system enhances customer engagement by providing a gamified purchasing experience.
- **Business Intelligence**: Data collected from Power Card usage provides insights into customer behavior, helping to refine marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction.
- **Brand Differentiation**: This proprietary currency system differentiates Dave & Buster's from competitors, creating a unique and immersive experience that combines dining with entertainment in a seamless manner.

### Conclusion

Dave & Buster's use of a proprietary currency system through Power Cards is a strategic tactic that enhances revenue generation, operational efficiency, customer loyalty, and security. By converting cash into a dedicated in-house currency, the company effectively manages customer spending, encourages repeat business, and collects valuable data to drive future business decisions. This approach not only maximizes immediate cash flow but also strengthens the overall business model by fostering a loyal customer base and differentiating the brand in the competitive entertainment and dining industry.
