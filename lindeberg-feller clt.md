Lindeberg-Feller CLT


**ASSISTANT**

The Lindeberg-Feller Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a generalization of the classical Central Limit Theorem to sequences of independent, but not necessarily identically distributed, random variables. This theorem relaxes the conditions of the classical CLT, making it applicable to a wider variety of random variable sequences by introducing the Lindeberg condition.

### Statement of the Lindeberg-Feller Central Limit Theorem

Consider a sequence of independent random variables \(\{X_i\}\) with means \(E[X_i] = \mu_i\) and variances \(\text{Var}(X_i) = \sigma_i^2\). Define the normalized sum of these random variables as:
$$ S_n = \sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \mu_i), $$
and let \(\sigma_n^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n \sigma_i^2\) be the total variance of the sum \(S_n\).

The sequence \(\{X_i\}\) satisfies the Lindeberg condition if for every \(\epsilon > 0\):
$$ \frac{1}{\sigma_n^2} \sum_{i=1}^n E \left[ (X_i - \mu_i)^2 \mathbf{1}_{\{|X_i - \mu_i| > \epsilon \sigma_n\}} \right] \to 0 \quad \text{as} \quad n \to \infty. $$

### Theorem

If the Lindeberg condition is satisfied, then the normalized sum \( S_n / \sigma_n \) converges in distribution to a standard normal distribution:
$$ \frac{S_n}{\sigma_n} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \mu_i)}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n \sigma_i^2}} \xrightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}(0,1) \quad \text{as} \quad n \to \infty. $$

### Proof Sketch

The proof of the Lindeberg-Feller CLT involves several key steps:

1. **Decomposition**:
   Consider the sum \( S_n \) and decompose it into a sum of contributions from small and large deviations. The small deviations contribute to the central limit behavior, while the Lindeberg condition ensures that the large deviations are negligible.

2. **Lindeberg Condition**:
   Show that the Lindeberg condition controls the contribution of large deviations to the variance of the sum. Specifically, the condition ensures that the probability mass of the large deviations becomes insignificant as \( n \) increases.

3. **Characteristic Functions**:
   Use characteristic functions to show the convergence in distribution. The characteristic function of the normalized sum converges to the characteristic function of the standard normal distribution, primarily by leveraging the Lindeberg condition to handle the truncation errors.

### Applications

The Lindeberg-Feller CLT is particularly useful in various contexts where the random variables are independent but not identically distributed. Some applications include:

1. **Sum of Heterogeneous Random Variables**:
   In scenarios where the random variables have different distributions, the Lindeberg-Feller CLT ensures that their normalized sum converges to a normal distribution.

2. **Statistical Inference**:
   This theorem provides the theoretical foundation for the asymptotic normality of estimators in non-homogeneous settings, such as regression analysis with heteroskedastic errors.

3. **Finance and Risk Management**:
   Used to assess the aggregate risk of a portfolio of assets with different risk characteristics, ensuring that the total risk behaves normally under the Lindeberg condition.

### Example

Consider a sequence of independent random variables \(\{X_i\}\) with means \(\mu_i\) and variances \(\sigma_i^2\). Suppose \(X_i\) represents the profit from the \(i\)-th investment, and these investments have different expected returns and variances.

To apply the Lindeberg-Feller CLT, check the Lindeberg condition:
$$ \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{\sigma_n^2} \sum_{i=1}^n E \left[ (X_i - \mu_i)^2 \mathbf{1}_{\{|X_i - \mu_i| > \epsilon \sigma_n\}} \right] = 0 \quad \text{for every } \epsilon > 0. $$

If this condition holds, then the total profit \( S_n = \sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \mu_i) \) normalized by its standard deviation \(\sigma_n\) will be approximately normally distributed for large \(n\).

### Comparison with Other CLTs

1. **Classical CLT**:
   The classical CLT requires i.i.d. random variables with finite variance. The Lindeberg-Feller CLT generalizes this to independent, but not necessarily identically distributed, random variables.

2. **Lyapunov’s CLT**:
   The Lyapunov CLT uses a moment condition (involving the \( (2 + \delta) \)-th moments of the random variables) to ensure convergence. The Lindeberg condition is often considered more intuitive and directly related to controlling large deviations.
