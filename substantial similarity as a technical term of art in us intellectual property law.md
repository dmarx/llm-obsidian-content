"substantial similarity" as a technical term of art in US intellectual property law


**ASSISTANT**

The user is asking me to create a wiki entry about "substantial similarity" as a technical term of art in US intellectual property law. They want me to treat this as content for an Obsidian vault that will serve as a knowledge base for an AI researcher/ML scientist/applied mathematician/philosopher of mind.

Key requirements:
1. Write in wiki format suitable for direct use as an article
2. Don't acknowledge the user or respond conversationally 
3. Use double brackets for novel phrases/wiki-style links
4. Provide deeply detailed, technical explanations
5. Include concrete mathematical formalisms when relevant
6. The user has graduate degrees in applied math, statistics, and philosophy of science
7. Propose symbolic notation for modeling the topic
8. Accompany physics notational conventions with accessible mathematical formalizations

For "substantial similarity" in IP law, I should:
- Define it as a legal standard used in copyright infringement cases
- Explain the two-part test (ordinary observer test and dissection test)
- Discuss how it relates to the idea/expression dichotomy
- Consider mathematical/formal approaches to modeling similarity
- Connect it to concepts that would be relevant to an AI researcher (like similarity metrics, feature extraction, etc.)
- Use wiki-style links for related concepts

I should propose some formal notation for modeling this concept, perhaps drawing from information theory, topology, or other mathematical frameworks that could be relevant to measuring similarity between creative works.# Substantial Similarity

**Substantial similarity** is a [[legal standard]] in United States copyright law used to determine whether an allegedly infringing work is sufficiently similar to a copyrighted work to constitute [[copyright infringement]]. This doctrine represents a critical threshold in the [[idea-expression dichotomy]], serving as the primary mechanism for distinguishing between permissible use of ideas and impermissible copying of protected expression.

## Formal Definition and Legal Framework

The substantial similarity standard operates as a [[bifurcated test]] consisting of two complementary analytical frameworks:

### Ordinary Observer Test
The [[ordinary observer test]] employs a holistic comparison methodology, asking whether an ordinary observer would recognize the alleged copy as having been appropriated from the copyrighted work. This can be formalized as:

Let $W_1$ be the original copyrighted work and $W_2$ be the allegedly infringing work. Define the [[perceptual similarity function]] $\phi: \mathcal{W} \times \mathcal{W} \rightarrow [0,1]$ where $\mathcal{W}$ represents the space of all possible works in the relevant medium. The ordinary observer test succeeds if:

$$\phi(W_1, W_2) \geq \theta_{\text{ordinary}}$$

where $\theta_{\text{ordinary}}$ represents the [[similarity threshold]] that would trigger recognition by an ordinary observer.

### Analytic Dissection Test
The [[analytic dissection test]] requires a more granular analysis, systematically comparing constituent elements while filtering out [[non-protectable elements]] such as ideas, facts, and [[scenes à faire]]. This can be modeled as:

Let $\pi: \mathcal{W} \rightarrow \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{E})$ be a [[decomposition function]] that maps works to sets of constituent elements, where $\mathcal{E}$ represents the universe of possible expressive elements. Define the [[protectability filter]] $\rho: \mathcal{E} \rightarrow \{0,1\}$ such that $\rho(e) = 1$ if element $e$ is protectable expression and $\rho(e) = 0$ otherwise.

The [[filtered element sets]] are:
$$E_1^{\text{prot}} = \{e \in \pi(W_1) : \rho(e) = 1\}$$
$$E_2^{\text{prot}} = \{e \in \pi(W_2) : \rho(e) = 1\}$$

The analytic dissection test examines whether:
$$\frac{|E_1^{\text{prot}} \cap E_2^{\text{prot}}|}{|E_1^{\text{prot}}|} \geq \theta_{\text{analytic}}$$

## Circuit Split and Jurisdictional Variations

The substantial similarity doctrine exhibits significant [[jurisdictional heterogeneity]] across federal circuits:

### Ninth Circuit Approach
The [[Ninth Circuit]] employs the **extrinsic-intrinsic test** established in *Sid & Marty Krofft Television Productions v. McDonald's Corp.* (1977):

- **Extrinsic test**: Objective comparison of [[specific expressive elements]]
- **Intrinsic test**: Subjective evaluation based on [[total concept and feel]]

### Second Circuit Approach  
The [[Second Circuit]] utilizes the **[[abstraction-filtration-comparison test]]** from *Computer Associates International v. Altai* (1992), particularly influential in [[software copyright]] cases:

1. **Abstraction**: Decompose the work into constituent abstraction levels
2. **Filtration**: Remove non-protectable elements
3. **Comparison**: Assess similarity of remaining protectable expression

## Mathematical Formalization of Similarity Metrics

### Information-Theoretic Approach
Drawing from [[information theory]], substantial similarity can be conceptualized using [[mutual information]]:

$$I(W_1; W_2) = H(W_1) + H(W_2) - H(W_1, W_2)$$

where $H(\cdot)$ denotes [[Shannon entropy]]. A work exhibits substantial similarity when:

$$\frac{I(W_1; W_2)}{\min(H(W_1), H(W_2))} \geq \theta_{\text{info}}$$

### Topological Similarity Measures
In the [[vector space model]] where works are represented as points in a high-dimensional [[feature space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$, substantial similarity can be measured using various [[distance metrics]]:

$$d_{\text{cosine}}(W_1, W_2) = 1 - \frac{W_1 \cdot W_2}{||W_1||_2 ||W_2||_2}$$

$$d_{\text{Jaccard}}(W_1, W_2) = 1 - \frac{|F(W_1) \cap F(W_2)|}{|F(W_1) \cup F(W_2)|}$$

where $F(W)$ represents the set of features extracted from work $W$.

## Computational Implications

The substantial similarity standard presents significant challenges for [[automated copyright detection]] systems. The legal requirement to distinguish between [[protectable expression]] and [[non-protectable ideas]] necessitates sophisticated [[semantic analysis]] capabilities that exceed simple [[string matching]] or [[fingerprinting]] approaches.

### Feature Engineering Challenges
Effective computational implementation requires:

1. **[[Hierarchical decomposition]]** of works into multiple abstraction levels
2. **[[Semantic feature extraction]]** that captures expressive rather than purely structural elements  
3. **[[Context-aware filtering]]** to identify and exclude non-protectable elements
4. **[[Perceptual modeling]]** that approximates human aesthetic judgment

### Machine Learning Applications
Modern [[deep learning]] approaches attempt to model substantial similarity through:

$$\text{Similarity}(W_1, W_2) = f_\theta(\text{Encoder}(W_1), \text{Encoder}(W_2))$$

where $f_\theta$ represents a [[learned similarity function]] and $\text{Encoder}(\cdot)$ maps works to high-dimensional [[latent representations]].

## Philosophical and Epistemological Considerations

The substantial similarity doctrine reflects deeper questions about the nature of [[creative originality]] and [[aesthetic similarity]]. The standard implicitly assumes that:

1. **[[Similarity is measurable]]**: Creative works exist in a space where meaningful distance metrics can be defined
2. **[[Protectability is decidable]]**: Clear boundaries exist between ideas and expression
3. **[[Ordinary perception is stable]]**: Average observers exhibit consistent similarity judgments

These assumptions interface with fundamental questions in [[philosophy of mind]] regarding the nature of [[aesthetic experience]] and [[creative cognition]].
