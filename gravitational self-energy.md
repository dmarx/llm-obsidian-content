### Gravitational Self-Energy

#### Overview

Gravitational self-energy is a concept in physics that describes the energy associated with the gravitational field produced by a mass distribution. In the context of the [[Objective Reduction|Objective Reduction (OR)]] theory proposed by [[Roger Penrose]], gravitational self-energy plays a crucial role in determining the timescale for the collapse of quantum superpositions.

#### Definition

The gravitational self-energy $E_G$ of a system quantifies the energy due to the gravitational interactions within the system's own mass distribution. For a given mass distribution $\rho(\mathbf{r})$, the gravitational self-energy is calculated by integrating the gravitational potential energy over all pairs of mass elements within the distribution.

#### Mathematical Formalism

To formalize the concept, consider a mass distribution $\rho(\mathbf{r})$ within a region of space. The gravitational potential energy $U$ between two infinitesimal mass elements $dm_1$ and $dm_2$ separated by a distance $|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r'}|$ is given by:

$$ dU = -G \frac{dm_1 \, dm_2}{|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r'}|} $$

where $G$ is the gravitational constant. Integrating this over the entire mass distribution, we get the total gravitational self-energy $E_G$:

$$ E_G = -\frac{G}{2} \int \int \frac{\rho(\mathbf{r}) \rho(\mathbf{r'})}{|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r'}|} \, d^3r \, d^3r' $$

The factor of $\frac{1}{2}$ is included to correct for the double counting of interactions between pairs of mass elements.

#### Application in Objective Reduction

In the context of OR, Penrose uses the concept of gravitational self-energy to determine when a quantum superposition will collapse. Specifically, if a quantum system is in a superposition of states with different mass distributions $\rho_1(\mathbf{r})$ and $\rho_2(\mathbf{r})$, the gravitational self-energy difference $E_G$ between these distributions dictates the collapse timescale.

For a superposition of two states $|\psi_1\rangle$ and $|\psi_2\rangle$, the gravitational self-energy difference is:

$$ E_G = G \int \int \frac{(\rho_1(\mathbf{r}) - \rho_2(\mathbf{r})) (\rho_1(\mathbf{r'}) - \rho_2(\mathbf{r'}))}{|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r'}|} \, d^3r \, d^3r' $$

Penrose proposes that the collapse time $\tau$ of the superposition is given by:

$$ \tau \approx \frac{\hbar}{E_G} $$

where $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant. This implies that larger mass distributions (with higher gravitational self-energy differences) collapse more quickly, while smaller distributions collapse more slowly.

#### Examples and Implications

1. **Microscopic Systems**:
   For microscopic systems, such as electrons or atoms, the gravitational self-energy is typically very small. Consequently, the collapse time $\tau$ is extremely long, making gravitational effects negligible at such scales.

2. **Macroscopic Systems**:
   For macroscopic systems, such as large molecules or biological structures, the gravitational self-energy difference can be significant. In the OR theory, this would mean that macroscopic superpositions would collapse more rapidly, potentially linking quantum mechanics with classical behavior.

3. **Consciousness and Microtubules**:
   In the [[Orchestrated Objective Reduction|Orch-OR]] theory, Penrose and Hameroff suggest that the collapse of quantum states within microtubules in neurons is influenced by gravitational self-energy. The orchestrated collapse of these states is proposed to be a mechanism for conscious experiences.

#### Criticisms and Challenges

1. **Empirical Validation**:
   Direct empirical evidence for gravitational self-energy causing wavefunction collapse is lacking. Experimental tests of this hypothesis are challenging due to the small magnitudes of gravitational effects at the quantum scale.

2. **Decoherence**:
   Critics argue that decoherence due to environmental interactions dominates over gravitational effects in most practical situations, making it difficult to isolate and observe gravitationally induced collapse.

3. **Alternative Theories**:
   Many alternative theories explain the transition from quantum to classical behavior without invoking gravitational self-energy. These include decoherence theory and various interpretations of quantum mechanics.

### Conclusion

Gravitational self-energy is a crucial concept in Penrose's Objective Reduction theory, linking the geometry of spacetime with quantum mechanics. While the idea offers an intriguing perspective on wavefunction collapse and consciousness, it faces significant empirical and theoretical challenges. Further research and experimentation are needed to explore the validity and implications of gravitational self-energy in quantum systems and its potential role in the OR theory.
