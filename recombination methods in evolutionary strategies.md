## Recombination Methods in Evolutionary Strategies

### Overview

Recombination, also known as crossover, is a genetic operator used in [[evolutionary strategies]] (ES) to combine the genetic information of two or more parent individuals to produce offspring. The purpose of recombination is to introduce new genetic material into the population, enhancing diversity and potentially combining beneficial traits from different parents. Recombination methods can be broadly categorized into two types: discrete and intermediate recombination.

### Types of Recombination

1. **Discrete Recombination**
2. **Intermediate Recombination**

### Discrete Recombination

In discrete recombination, each gene of the offspring is chosen from the corresponding genes of the parents based on a discrete distribution. This method preserves the distinct values present in the parent population.

#### Formalization

For two parent individuals \( \mathbf{x}^1 \) and \( \mathbf{x}^2 \), the offspring \( \mathbf{x}' \) is generated as:

$$
x_i' = \begin{cases}
x_i^1 & \text{with probability } 0.5 \\
x_i^2 & \text{with probability } 0.5
\end{cases}
$$

This can be generalized to \( k \) parents as:

$$
x_i' = x_i^{p(i)}
$$

where \( p(i) \) is a randomly selected parent index for each gene \( i \).

#### Characteristics

- Maintains the exact gene values from the parent population.
- Introduces combinatorial diversity by mixing gene values.
- Useful when distinct gene values are crucial.

### Intermediate Recombination

In intermediate recombination, the genes of the offspring are a weighted average of the corresponding genes from the parents. This method creates new gene values that are intermediate to those of the parents, potentially exploring new areas of the search space.

#### Formalization

For two parent individuals \( \mathbf{x}^1 \) and \( \mathbf{x}^2 \), the offspring \( \mathbf{x}' \) is generated as:

$$
x_i' = \alpha x_i^1 + (1 - \alpha) x_i^2
$$

where \( \alpha \) is a random number between 0 and 1. In the case of \( k \) parents, the offspring gene can be an average:

$$
x_i' = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{j=1}^k x_i^j
$$

#### Characteristics

- Creates new gene values by averaging, which can lead to smoother transitions.
- Can exploit intermediate solutions between parents, leading to potentially better offspring.
- Useful in continuous optimization problems where gene values are real numbers.

### Strategy Parameter Recombination

In addition to recombining the solution vectors, [[evolutionary strategies]] also involve recombination of strategy parameters such as mutation step sizes. Both discrete and intermediate recombination can be applied to these parameters as well.

#### Discrete Recombination of Strategy Parameters

For strategy parameters \( \mathbf{\sigma}^1 \) and \( \mathbf{\sigma}^2 \):

$$
\sigma_i' = \begin{cases}
\sigma_i^1 & \text{with probability } 0.5 \\
\sigma_i^2 & \text{with probability } 0.5
\end{cases}
$$

#### Intermediate Recombination of Strategy Parameters

For strategy parameters \( \mathbf{\sigma}^1 \) and \( \mathbf{\sigma}^2 \):

$$
\sigma_i' = \alpha \sigma_i^1 + (1 - \alpha) \sigma_i^2
$$

### Applications

Recombination methods are applied in various domains, including:

- **Engineering Optimization**: Combining structural design solutions to explore new configurations.
- **Robotics**: Integrating different control strategies to improve autonomous system performance.
- **Finance**: Mixing different portfolio strategies to achieve balanced risk and return.
- **Machine Learning**: Combining different hyperparameter settings to find optimal configurations.

### Practical Considerations

1. **Choice of Recombination Method**: The choice between discrete and intermediate recombination depends on the nature of the problem. Discrete recombination is suitable for problems where distinct gene values are important, while intermediate recombination is ideal for continuous optimization.
2. **Number of Parents**: Increasing the number of parents can enhance diversity but may also increase computational complexity. A balance must be struck based on the problem requirements.
3. **Recombination Rate**: The frequency of recombination should be tuned to ensure sufficient diversity without disrupting the convergence process.

### Conclusion

Recombination methods are essential components of [[evolutionary strategies]], facilitating the creation of new and potentially superior solutions by combining the genetic material of multiple parents. Discrete and intermediate recombination offer different advantages and are suitable for different types of optimization problems. Understanding and selecting the appropriate recombination method is crucial for the effective application of [[evolutionary strategies]].

### Overview

Recombination, also known as crossover, is a genetic operator used in [[evolutionary strategies]] (ES) to combine the genetic material of two or more parent individuals to produce offspring. The purpose of recombination is to introduce new genetic combinations, promoting diversity and potentially leading to better solutions. Recombination methods can be broadly categorized into discrete and intermediate recombination.

2. **Intermediate Recombination**

### 1. Discrete Recombination

In discrete recombination, each gene of the offspring is chosen from the corresponding genes of the parents based on a discrete distribution. This method maintains the distinct values present in the parent population.

#### Process

- For each gene position \( i \):
  \[
  x_i' = \begin{cases}
  x_i^1 & \text{with probability } 0.5 \\
  x_i^2 & \text{with probability } 0.5
  \end{cases}
  \]
  where \( x_i^1 \) and \( x_i^2 \) are the genes from parent 1 and parent 2, respectively.

#### Example

Consider two parents with the following genes:

- **Parent 1**: \( \mathbf{x}^1 = [1, 4, 6] \)
- **Parent 2**: \( \mathbf{x}^2 = [2, 3, 7] \)

Discrete recombination might produce an offspring:

- **Offspring**: \( \mathbf{x}' = [1, 3, 7] \) (by randomly choosing genes from each parent)

#### Characteristics

- Maintains the exact gene values from the parents.
- Introduces combinatorial diversity by mixing gene values.

### 2. Intermediate Recombination

In intermediate recombination, the genes of the offspring are a weighted average of the corresponding genes from the parents. This method creates new gene values that are intermediate to those of the parents, potentially exploring new areas of the search space.

#### Process

- For each gene position \( i \):
  \[

  \]
  where \( \alpha \) is a random number between 0 and 1, and \( x_i^1 \) and \( x_i^2 \) are the genes from parent 1 and parent 2, respectively.

#### Example

Consider two parents with the following genes:

- **Parent 1**: \( \mathbf{x}^1 = [1, 4, 6] \)
- **Parent 2**: \( \mathbf{x}^2 = [2, 3, 7] \)

Intermediate recombination might produce an offspring:

- **Offspring**: \( \mathbf{x}' = [1.5, 3.5, 6.5] \) (by averaging the genes from each parent)

#### Characteristics

- Creates new gene values by averaging, which can lead to smoother transitions.
- Can exploit intermediate solutions between parents, leading to potentially better offspring.
- Useful in continuous optimization problems where gene values are real numbers.

  \[
  \sigma_i' = \begin{cases}
  \sigma_i^1 & \text{with probability } 0.5 \\
  \sigma_i^2 & \text{with probability } 0.5
  \end{cases}
  \]
  where \( \sigma_i^1 \) and \( \sigma_i^2 \) are the strategy parameters from parent 1 and parent 2, respectively.
