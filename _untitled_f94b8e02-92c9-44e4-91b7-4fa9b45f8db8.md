**ASSISTANT**

Search patterns are systematic strategies used to cover a search area methodically and efficiently when attempting to locate a missing person, object, or target. In [[Search and Rescue (SAR)]] operations, search patterns are designed to maximize the Probability of Detection (POD) while optimizing the use of available resources, such as personnel, vehicles, aircraft, or vessels.

Selecting the appropriate search pattern depends on several factors, including the nature of the search object (e.g., a missing person, a downed aircraft, or a drifting vessel), environmental conditions (e.g., weather, visibility, terrain), and the capabilities of the search resources. Below is a detailed overview of common search patterns used in various types of search operations.

## 1. **Common Search Patterns**

### **1.1 Parallel Track (Parallel Sweep) Search Pattern**

**Description**: The parallel track search pattern involves covering the search area in parallel lines. This pattern is useful when the search area is large, and the target is expected to be uniformly distributed or could be anywhere within the area.

**Applications**: This pattern is commonly used in maritime searches, aerial searches over large open areas, and ground searches in flat terrains like deserts or fields.

**Advantages**:
- Provides thorough coverage of the search area.
- Simple to plan and execute, especially over uniform terrain or in open water.

**Disadvantages**:
- Can be inefficient if the target is more likely to be in a particular sub-area, wasting resources on low-probability areas.
- Requires consistent navigational precision to maintain parallel lines.

**Execution**: Searchers move in straight, parallel lines across the search area, spaced at regular intervals based on visibility and search effectiveness.

**Pattern Layout**:

$$
\text{Spacing} = \frac{\text{effective sweep width}}{2}
$$

where the effective sweep width is determined by visibility, target size, and environmental conditions.

### **1.2 Creeping Line Search Pattern**

**Description**: The creeping line search pattern involves moving back and forth along a base line within a narrow search area. It is used when the target is thought to be near a specific line or feature, such as a coast, road, or flight path.

**Applications**: Useful in searches where the missing person or object was last seen or likely to be along a known path, such as a missing hiker on a trail or a vessel along a shipping lane.

**Advantages**:
- Concentrates search efforts along a specific axis where the target is more likely to be.
- Allows for a thorough search of a specific corridor or linear feature.

**Disadvantages**:
- Less efficient for large search areas where the target location is highly uncertain.
- May require more navigation adjustments than parallel sweeps, especially in complex terrain.

**Execution**: Searchers move along the base line, turning at regular intervals to cover the area on either side of the line, essentially creeping forward with each pass.

### **1.3 Sector Search Pattern**

**Description**: The sector search pattern (or radial search) involves searching in a circular pattern divided into sectors, usually originating from a central point. It is often used when the last known position (LKP) of the target is known or when the target is thought to be in the immediate vicinity of the search starting point.

**Applications**: This pattern is used in marine searches around a known last position or in areas with good initial location information, such as when a plane is known to have crashed within a certain radius.

**Advantages**:
- Provides intensive coverage near the LKP, increasing the chance of detection in the vicinity.
- Effective in areas where the target is likely to be stationary or drift minimally.

**Disadvantages**:
- Less effective for large areas or when the target could have moved significantly.
- May require more complex navigation due to changing headings.

**Execution**: Searchers divide the area into pie-shaped sectors and search each sector, often beginning with a sweep through the center and then expanding outward. The pattern usually involves overlapping segments to ensure full coverage.

**Pattern Layout**:

- A common configuration is six 60-degree sectors with each pass expanding in radius.
  
### **1.4 Expanding Square Search Pattern**

**Description**: The expanding square search pattern is used when the searchers begin at a specific point and then systematically expand the search in a square pattern. This pattern is particularly effective when the search area is small and the target is expected to be near the initial search point.

**Applications**: Typically used in ground and aerial searches where the initial search area is well-defined, such as around a known last location or around a beacon's location.

**Advantages**:
- Provides concentrated coverage close to the starting point, which is ideal if the target is expected to be nearby.
- Simple to navigate and execute in open areas.

**Disadvantages**:
- Inefficient for large areas or if the target could have moved far from the starting point.
- Searchers may need to adjust for terrain obstacles or varying visibility.

**Execution**: Searchers start from a central point and increase their search distance with each pass, forming an expanding square. Each leg of the square increases in length by a set increment.

**Pattern Layout**:

$$
\text{First leg} = x, \quad \text{Second leg} = 2x, \quad \text{Third leg} = 3x, \ldots
$$

where \(x\) is a chosen distance increment based on visibility and searcher speed.

### **1.5 Contour Search Pattern**

**Description**: The contour search pattern is designed to follow the natural contours of the terrain, such as hillsides, mountains, or riverbanks. This pattern is particularly useful in SAR operations in rugged environments.

**Applications**: Used in ground searches in mountainous regions, along ridges, or around bodies of water.

**Advantages**:
- Maximizes coverage along specific terrain features where the target is more likely to be located.
- Helps prevent searchers from missing the target in complex topography.

**Disadvantages**:
- Navigational challenges due to varying terrain and potential obstacles.
- May be less systematic and harder to plan compared to grid-based patterns.

**Execution**: Searchers move along predefined contours, often beginning at the highest elevation and moving downwards, or along a water body moving upstream or downstream.

## 2. **Advanced Search Patterns**

### **2.1 Drift Search Pattern**

**Description**: The drift search pattern is used in maritime or lake searches when the target is believed to be adrift due to wind or current. This pattern accounts for the movement of the target over time.

**Applications**: Common in searches for missing boats, life rafts, or persons who have fallen overboard.

**Advantages**:
- Incorporates drift data, which improves the likelihood of detecting the target given time and environmental factors.
- Flexible and adaptable to changes in weather or sea conditions.

**Disadvantages**:
- Requires accurate drift modeling and frequent updates to remain effective.
- Search area can expand rapidly, requiring more resources and coordination.

**Execution**: The search area is adjusted based on drift predictions, with searchers moving systematically across the estimated drift path. As new data (e.g., wind speed, current direction) becomes available, the search area and pattern are recalculated and adjusted accordingly.

### **2.2 Grid Search Pattern**

**Description**: The grid search pattern involves dividing the search area into a grid of equal-sized squares and systematically searching each square. It is particularly effective in ground searches where the target is stationary or likely to be within a defined area.

**Applications**: Used in urban or rural searches for missing persons, evidence recovery, or crime scene investigations.

**Advantages**:
- Provides thorough coverage and minimizes the chance of missing the target.
- Easy to organize and execute with a large number of searchers.

**Disadvantages**:
- Can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, especially in large areas.
- Less efficient if the target location is highly uncertain or if the area is extremely large.

**Execution**: Searchers systematically cover each grid square, often moving from one to the next in a zig-zag or sweeping pattern, ensuring full coverage before moving to the adjacent grid.

## 3. **Factors Influencing the Choice of Search Pattern**

1. **Environment and Terrain**:
   - Flat, open areas (fields, deserts): Parallel track or grid patterns.
   - Dense forests or rugged terrain: Contour or creeping line patterns.
   - Open water or maritime environments: Parallel track, sector, or drift patterns.

2. **Target Behavior**:
   - Stationary or slow-moving targets: Expanding square or sector search.
   - Fast-moving or drifting targets: Drift search or continuously updated patterns.

3. **Resources Available**:
   - Limited personnel or equipment: Use more efficient patterns like parallel track or expanding square.
   - Large teams and resources: Grid or comprehensive parallel track searches for complete coverage.

4. **Probability Distribution (POA)**:
   - High POA in specific areas: Use patterns that focus on these areas (sector or expanding square).
   - Uniform POA across a large area: Parallel track or grid patterns for broad coverage.

## 4. **Optimization and Mathematical Modeling in Search Patterns**

Search patterns are often optimized using mathematical models and [[Search Theory]] principles to maximize the Probability of Detection (POD) and Probability of Success (POS). Factors such as searcher speed, visibility, terrain, and environmental conditions are incorporated into these models to determine the best search strategy.

- **Optimization Algorithms**: Techniques like linear programming or dynamic programming are used to allocate search resources efficiently across various patterns.
- **Probability Models**: Bayesian models update the probability of target location based on search results, refining the search pattern dynamically.
- **Simulation Models**: Monte Carlo simulations and agent-based models help test and evaluate different search patterns under various scenarios.
