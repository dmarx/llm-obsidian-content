Cartan's classification of symmetric spaces


**ASSISTANT**

Cartan's classification of symmetric spaces is a cornerstone in the theory of [[symmetric spaces]], which are manifolds exhibiting a high degree of symmetry. Symmetric spaces can be understood through the lens of [[Lie group|Lie groups]] and their corresponding [[Lie algebra|Lie algebras]]. Élie Cartan developed a systematic classification of these spaces, revealing deep connections between geometry, algebra, and analysis.

### Definition of Symmetric Spaces

A **symmetric space** \(M\) is a smooth manifold such that for every point \(p \in M\), there is an involutive isometry \(s_p\) (an isometry that is its own inverse, \(s_p^2 = \text{id}\)) that leaves \(p\) fixed and reverses the geodesics through \(p\).

Formally, \(M\) is a symmetric space if for every point \(p \in M\), there exists an isometry \(s_p: M \to M\) such that:

1. \(s_p(p) = p\)
2. The differential \(d(s_p)\) at \(p\) acts as \(-\text{id}\) on the tangent space \(T_pM\).

### Classification Overview

Cartan's classification divides symmetric spaces into two broad categories:

1. **Riemannian Symmetric Spaces**: These are symmetric spaces equipped with a Riemannian metric.
2. **Pseudo-Riemannian Symmetric Spaces**: These spaces have a pseudo-Riemannian metric, allowing indefinite metrics.

### Riemannian Symmetric Spaces

The classification of Riemannian symmetric spaces relies on the concept of the isometry group of the manifold. For a symmetric space \(M\), its isometry group \(G\) acts transitively on \(M\), and the stabilizer of a point \(p \in M\), denoted \(K\), is a subgroup of \(G\). Thus, \(M\) can be represented as a homogeneous space \(G/K\).

#### Irreducible Symmetric Spaces

Cartan classified irreducible Riemannian symmetric spaces into two types:

1. **Compact Type**: These symmetric spaces are associated with compact Lie groups.
2. **Non-Compact Type**: These symmetric spaces correspond to non-compact Lie groups.

##### Compact Type

Examples include:

- **Spheres** \(S^n = \text{SO}(n+1)/\text{SO}(n)\)
- **Complex Projective Spaces** \(\mathbb{C}P^n = \text{SU}(n+1)/\text{S}(\text{U}(n) \times \text{U}(1))\)
- **Grassmannians** \(G_{k,n} = \text{SO}(n)/(\text{SO}(k) \times \text{SO}(n-k))\)

##### Non-Compact Type

Examples include:

- **Hyperbolic Spaces** \(\mathbb{H}^n = \text{SO}(n,1)/\text{SO}(n)\)
- **Complex Hyperbolic Spaces** \(\mathbb{C}H^n = \text{SU}(n,1)/\text{S}(\text{U}(n) \times \text{U}(1))\)

### Pseudo-Riemannian Symmetric Spaces

Cartan's classification also extends to pseudo-Riemannian symmetric spaces, which involve metrics that are not necessarily positive definite. These spaces often arise in the context of general relativity and theoretical physics.

#### Example

- **Minkowski Space** \(\mathbb{R}^{p,q}\): This is a pseudo-Riemannian manifold with the indefinite metric \((+,\ldots,+,-,\ldots,-)\).

### Cartan Involution and Symmetric Pair

A key tool in Cartan's classification is the concept of the Cartan involution, which helps in identifying the symmetric pairs \((\mathfrak{g}, \mathfrak{k})\) where \(\mathfrak{g}\) is the Lie algebra of \(G\) and \(\mathfrak{k}\) is the Lie algebra of \(K\).

#### Cartan Involution

A **Cartan involution** \(\theta\) of a Lie algebra \(\mathfrak{g}\) is an involutive automorphism (\(\theta^2 = \text{id}\)) such that the bilinear form \(B_\theta(x, y) = -B(x, \theta y)\) is positive definite, where \(B\) is the Killing form of \(\mathfrak{g}\).

The Lie algebra \(\mathfrak{g}\) can be decomposed into eigenspaces of \(\theta\):

$$
\mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{k} \oplus \mathfrak{p},
$$

where \(\mathfrak{k}\) is the +1 eigenspace and \(\mathfrak{p}\) is the -1 eigenspace. This pair \((\mathfrak{g}, \mathfrak{k})\) is called a symmetric pair.

### Applications

Cartan's classification has profound implications in various fields:

- **Geometry**: Understanding the structure and classification of spaces with high symmetry.
- **Theoretical Physics**: Analyzing spaces that model physical theories, such as spacetime in general relativity.
- **Representation Theory**: Studying representations of Lie groups and Lie algebras via symmetric spaces.
