# Hysteresis

Hysteresis is a nonlinear phenomenon characterized by path-dependent behavior and memory effects in which a system's output depends not only on its current input but also on its history of past inputs. This effect manifests as a distinctive loop when output is plotted against input, revealing a fundamental non-uniqueness in the system's response.

## Mathematical Formalization

### General Formulation

Mathematically, a system with hysteresis can be represented as an operator $\mathcal{H}$ mapping from input history to current output:

$$y(t) = \mathcal{H}[x(\tau), \tau \leq t]$$

where $y(t)$ is the output at time $t$, and $x(\tau)$ represents the input history up to time $t$.

Unlike memoryless systems where $y(t) = f(x(t))$, hysteretic systems retain memory of past states, resulting in different outputs for the same input depending on the path taken.

### Energy Perspective

The area enclosed by the hysteresis loop represents [[energy dissipation]] per cycle:

$$E_{dissipated} = \oint x \, dy$$

or equivalently:

$$E_{dissipated} = \int_{cycle} \left( \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} \right)_{\text{loading}} - \left( \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} \right)_{\text{unloading}} \, dx$$

This dissipation is irreversible and typically converts stored energy into heat through internal friction mechanisms.

## Models of Hysteresis

### Classical Models

#### Preisach Model

The [[Preisach model]] represents hysteresis as a weighted superposition of elementary hysteresis operators called [[hysterons]]:

$$y(t) = \int\int_{\alpha \geq \beta} \mu(\alpha, \beta) \, \gamma_{\alpha \beta}[x(t)] \, d\alpha \, d\beta$$

where:
- $\gamma_{\alpha \beta}$ is a relay operator with upper switching value $\alpha$ and lower switching value $\beta$
- $\mu(\alpha, \beta)$ is a weighting function called the [[Preisach density function]]

#### Jiles-Atherton Model

The [[Jiles-Atherton model]] describes magnetic hysteresis through differential equations tracking reversible and irreversible magnetization components:

$$\frac{dM_{irr}}{dH} = \frac{M_{an} - M_{irr}}{\delta k - \alpha (M_{an} - M_{irr})}$$

$$M = M_{irr} + c(M_{an} - M_{irr})$$

where $M$ is magnetization, $H$ is magnetic field, $M_{an}$ is anhysteretic magnetization, and parameters $k$, $c$, $\alpha$, and $\delta$ control the shape of the hysteresis loop.

#### Bouc-Wen Model

The [[Bouc-Wen model]] uses a differential equation to describe hysteretic restoring forces in mechanical systems:

$$\dot{z} = A\dot{x} - \beta|\dot{x}|z|z|^{n-1} - \gamma\dot{x}|z|^n$$

where $z$ is the hysteretic component of the restoring force, and parameters $A$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, and $n$ control the shape and smoothness of the hysteresis loop.

### Rate-Independent vs. Rate-Dependent Hysteresis

#### Rate-Independent Hysteresis

In [[rate-independent hysteresis]], the output depends on the history of input values but not on the rate at which the input changes. The hysteresis loop remains invariant under time rescaling:

$$\mathcal{H}[x(f(t))] = \mathcal{H}[x(t)] \circ f(t)$$

for any monotonically increasing function $f(t)$.

Classical examples include:
- [[Elastic-perfectly plastic materials]]
- [[Magnetic hysteresis]] in hard ferromagnetic materials
- [[Mechanical backlash]]

#### Rate-Dependent Hysteresis

In [[rate-dependent hysteresis]], both the history and the rate of input changes affect the output. The hysteresis loop's shape varies with the frequency or rate of input variation:

$$\mathcal{H}[x(t); \dot{x}(t)]$$

Examples include:
- [[Viscoelastic materials]]
- [[Magnetic hysteresis]] with eddy current effects
- [[Ferroelectric materials]] with domain wall dynamics

## Physical Mechanisms

### Material Hysteresis

#### Magnetic Hysteresis

In [[ferromagnetic materials]], hysteresis arises from:
- [[Domain wall pinning]] at defects and grain boundaries
- [[Energy barriers]] to domain rotation
- [[Magnetocrystalline anisotropy]]

The relationship between magnetic field $H$ and magnetic induction $B$ forms a hysteresis loop characterized by:
- [[Remanent magnetization]] ($B_r$): Magnetization remaining when $H = 0$
- [[Coercive field]] ($H_c$): Field required to demagnetize the material
- [[Saturation magnetization]] ($M_s$): Maximum possible magnetization

#### Mechanical Hysteresis

In [[structural materials]], hysteresis stems from:
- [[Microplasticity]] and dislocation movement
- [[Internal friction]] at grain boundaries
- [[Crack opening and closing]]

The stress-strain relationship exhibits hysteresis whose area represents [[energy dissipation]] through internal mechanisms.

#### Thermal Hysteresis

In [[phase transitions]], hysteresis occurs due to:
- [[Nucleation barriers]] for new phases
- [[Interfacial energy]] between phases
- [[Metastability]] of phases

Temperature-property relationships show different pathways during heating and cooling, with characteristic [[supercooling]] and [[superheating]] ranges.

### System-Level Hysteresis

#### Control Hysteresis

In [[control systems]], hysteresis is intentionally introduced through:
- [[Schmitt triggers]] with different switching thresholds
- [[Dead zones]] in actuators
- [[Bang-bang control]] with hysteresis bands

This prevents rapid oscillations caused by noise near threshold levels.

#### Mechanical Backlash

In [[gear trains]] and linkages, hysteresis appears as:
- [[Play]] between meshing components
- [[Lost motion]] during direction changes
- [[Compliance]] in connecting elements

This results in different response paths during forward and reverse motion.

## Quantitative Measures

### Hysteresis Loop Parameters

1. **Coercivity**: Input value required to reduce output to zero during reversal
2. **Remanence**: Output value remaining when input returns to zero
3. **Loop Area**: Energy dissipated per cycle
4. **Saturation**: Maximum attainable output values
5. **Loop Width**: Measure of path separation at a given output level

### Mathematical Descriptors

#### Hysteresis Ratio

$$HR = \frac{\text{maximum width of loop}}{\text{maximum output range}} \times 100\%$$

#### Normalized Loop Area

$$NLA = \frac{\text{loop area}}{\text{maximum input} \times \text{maximum output}}$$

#### Complex Modulus Approach

For dynamic systems, hysteresis can be characterized using a complex modulus:

$$E^* = E' + iE''$$

where $E'$ is the storage modulus and $E''$ is the loss modulus, with the loss factor:

$$\tan \delta = \frac{E''}{E'} = \frac{\text{energy dissipated per cycle}}{2\pi \times \text{maximum stored energy}}$$

### Fractional-Order Hysteresis

Recent models incorporate [[fractional calculus]] to capture complex memory effects:

$$D^{\alpha}y(t) + a \cdot y(t) = b \cdot x(t) + c \cdot |x(t)|$$

where $D^{\alpha}$ is the fractional derivative of order $\alpha$ (typically $0 < \alpha < 1$).

### Stochastic Hysteresis

Incorporating random effects through [[stochastic differential equations]]:

$$dy = f(y,x)dt + g(y,x)dW_t$$

where $dW_t$ represents a [[Wiener process]], capturing thermal fluctuations or measurement noise.

## Mathematical Symbols and Notation

We can develop a comprehensive notation for hysteresis analysis:

- $\mathcal{H}[x(t)]$: General hysteresis operator mapping input history to current output
- $\Gamma_{\alpha\beta}$: Elementary hysteron with switching values $\alpha$ and $\beta$
- $W_c(x \rightarrow y)$: Energy dissipated during path from state $x$ to state $y$
- $\mathcal{M}(t)$: Memory state of the system at time $t$
- $\mathbb{P}$: Preisach plane with regions corresponding to different memory states

## Computational Methods

### Numerical Implementation

Algorithms for simulating hysteretic systems:
```python
def preisach_model(input_history, preisach_density):
    """Implement Preisach hysteresis model."""
    output = 0
    memory_state = initialize_memory_state()
    
    # Update memory state based on input history
    for t in range(len(input_history)-1):
        memory_state = update_memory(memory_state, input_history[t], input_history[t+1])
    
    # Calculate output by integrating over active region
    for alpha, beta in active_region(memory_state):
        output += preisach_density(alpha, beta)
    
    return output
```
