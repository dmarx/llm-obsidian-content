## Non-Homogeneous Poisson Process (NHPP)

### Overview

A **Non-Homogeneous Poisson Process (NHPP)** is a stochastic process used to model the occurrence of events that happen randomly over time, where the rate of occurrence (intensity) is not constant but varies with time. This contrasts with a **Homogeneous Poisson Process (HPP)**, where the rate of occurrence is constant.

### Key Concepts

1. **Intensity Function (Rate Function) $\lambda(t)$**: The rate at which events occur at time $t$. In an NHPP, $\lambda(t)$ is a function of time, unlike in an HPP where it is constant.
2. **Counting Process $N(t)$**: Represents the total number of events that have occurred by time $t$.

### Mathematical Formulation

#### Intensity Function

The intensity function $\lambda(t)$ describes the rate of event occurrence at any time $t$. For an NHPP, $\lambda(t)$ is a non-negative, time-dependent function.

$$ \lambda(t) \geq 0, \quad t \geq 0 $$

#### Mean Value Function

The mean value function $M(t)$ represents the expected cumulative number of events by time $t$:

$$ M(t) = \int_0^t \lambda(u) \, du $$

This function integrates the intensity function over time, providing the expected total number of events up to time $t$.

#### Probability Mass Function

The probability that exactly $k$ events occur in the interval $[0, t]$ is given by:

$$ P(N(t) = k) = \frac{(M(t))^k e^{-M(t)}}{k!} $$

where $M(t)$ is the mean value function at time $t$.

### Properties

1. **Independent Increments**: The number of events occurring in disjoint time intervals are independent.
2. **Poisson Distribution**: The number of events in any interval of length $\Delta t$ is approximately Poisson distributed with parameter $\lambda(t) \Delta t$ for small $\Delta t$.

### Applications

NHPPs are used in various fields to model event occurrences where the rate of events changes over time, including:

1. **Software Reliability Engineering**: Modeling the occurrence of software failures over time as in the [[Goel-Okumoto Model]].
2. **Telecommunications**: Modeling call arrivals where the rate varies throughout the day.
3. **Finance**: Modeling the arrival of market orders or trades over time.

### Example: Software Reliability

In software reliability, an NHPP is often used to model the cumulative number of software failures over time during testing. The intensity function $\lambda(t)$ might decrease over time as more faults are detected and corrected.

#### Goel-Okumoto Model Revisited

In the [[Goel-Okumoto Model]], the intensity function $\lambda(t)$ and the mean value function $M(t)$ are defined as:

- Intensity Function:
  $$ \lambda(t) = N \lambda e^{-\lambda t} $$
  
- Mean Value Function:
  $$ M(t) = N (1 - e^{-\lambda t}) $$

where $N$ is the total number of faults and $\lambda$ is the fault detection rate.

#### Reliability Prediction

The number of failures by time $t$ follows a Poisson distribution with parameter $M(t)$. The probability of observing exactly $k$ failures by time $t$ is:

$$ P(N(t) = k) = \frac{(N (1 - e^{-\lambda t}))^k e^{-N (1 - e^{-\lambda t})}}{k!} $$

### Simulation of NHPP

To simulate an NHPP, one can use the **time transformation method**:

1. Generate inter-event times from an exponential distribution with rate parameter $\lambda(t)$.
2. Use these inter-event times to determine the occurrence times of events.

#### Algorithm

1. **Generate Uniform Random Variables**: Generate a sequence of uniform random variables $U_1, U_2, \ldots$.
2. **Transform to Inter-Event Times**: Use the inverse of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the exponential distribution to transform these uniform variables into inter-event times.
3. **Accumulate Event Times**: Sum the inter-event times to obtain the actual event times.

### Conclusion

The **Non-Homogeneous Poisson Process (NHPP)** is a versatile model for describing the occurrence of events over time when the event rate is not constant. Its ability to model time-varying rates makes it particularly useful in fields like [[software reliability engineering]], telecommunications, and finance. By understanding and applying NHPPs, analysts and engineers can more accurately predict and manage the occurrence of critical events in various domains.
