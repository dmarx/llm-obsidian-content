Enumerating all the named universality classes relevant to nonequilibrium dynamics poses a challenge, primarily because the field is expansive and continually evolving, with new classes potentially being identified as research progresses. Unlike equilibrium phase transitions, where universality classes such as the Ising class or the XY class are well-defined and relatively well-understood, the landscape of nonequilibrium universality classes is less clear-cut. This is partly due to the vast diversity of nonequilibrium systems and the complex dynamics that characterize them, including systems far from equilibrium, driven-dissipative systems, and those that involve time-dependent processes or are subject to external fluxes.

However, several key universality classes have been identified and extensively studied within the context of nonequilibrium dynamics. Here are some of the most notable ones:

1. **Directed Percolation (DP) Class**: This is perhaps the most important and ubiquitous universality class for nonequilibrium phase transitions, particularly for transitions into absorbing states where the system becomes dynamically inactive. The DP class is relevant to models of epidemic spreading, forest fires, and catalytic reactions, among others.

2. **Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) Class**: Characterizes the universal scaling behavior of growing interfaces and surfaces subject to random fluctuations. The KPZ class applies to a wide range of systems, from bacterial colony growth to surface erosion and deposition processes.

3. **Voter Model Class**: This class describes systems with coarsening dynamics, where domains of different states grow over time. It's relevant to models of opinion dynamics, certain types of spin systems, and biological competition.

4. **Manna Class**: Part of a broader category known as Sandpile models, the Manna class is associated with self-organized criticality, a concept where systems naturally evolve to a critical state. This universality class is relevant to describing avalanches in granular piles, earthquakes, and certain types of traffic flow.

5. **Ziff-Gulari-Barshad (ZGB) Class**: Describes phase transitions in catalytic reaction models, specifically the catalytic oxidation of CO on a surface. This class illustrates transitions between reactive and poisoned states in surface reactions.

6. **TASEP (Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process) Class**: Relevant to systems that exhibit transport phenomena, such as traffic flow, transport in narrow channels, and certain models of protein synthesis. TASEP and related models (e.g., ASEP for the asymmetric simple exclusion process) highlight the universality in non-equilibrium transport with exclusion constraints.

7. **Contact Process Class**: Often discussed in the context of epidemics and spreading phenomena, the contact process class describes the dynamics of infection spread and recovery in a population. It's closely related to the DP class but has its nuances in specific implementations.

It's difficult to provide a definitive number of nonequilibrium universality classes due to the ongoing nature of research in this area. New models and systems continue to be discovered and analyzed, potentially leading to the identification of new classes. Additionally, the classification is often based on numerical simulations and experimental observations, which can sometimes reveal subtle differences in critical behavior that necessitate the definition of new universality classes or the refinement of existing ones.

Moreover, the boundary between different universality classes can sometimes be blurred, with systems exhibiting crossover behavior under certain conditions. This complexity underscores the richness of nonequilibrium dynamics and highlights the continued need for theoretical, computational, and experimental advances to fully map out the landscape of nonequilibrium universality classes.
