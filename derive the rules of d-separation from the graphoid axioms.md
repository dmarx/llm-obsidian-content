title: derive the rules of d-separation from the graphoid axioms

derive the rules of d-separation from the [[graphoid]] axioms


**ASSISTANT**

Deriving the rules of d-separation directly from the [[graphoid]] axioms involves understanding how these foundational principles of conditional independence can inform the graphical criterion for conditional independence in Bayesian networks, represented by Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). While the [[graphoid]] axioms articulate general properties of conditional independence, d-separation provides a method for applying these principles to the structure of graphical models to infer conditional independence relations.

### Graphoid Axioms Recap

The [[graphoid]] axioms are:

1. **Symmetry:** \(X \perp Y | Z \implies Y \perp X | Z\)
2. **Decomposition:** \(X \perp Y, W | Z \implies X \perp Y | Z\)
3. **Weak Union:** \(X \perp Y, W | Z \implies X \perp Y | Z, W\)
4. **Contraction:** \(X \perp Y | Z \land X \perp W | Z, Y \implies X \perp Y, W | Z\)
5. **Intersection:** \(X \perp Y | Z, W \land X \perp W | Z, Y \implies X \perp Y, W | Z\) (Note: The intersection axiom does not hold in all probabilistic systems but is included for completeness.)

### D-Separation Overview

D-separation provides a graphical method to determine if two sets of variables \(X\) and \(Y\) are conditionally independent given a third set \(Z\), based on the paths between \(X\) and \(Y\) in a DAG. The primary rules of d-separation are based on the types of connections along these paths: serial connections, diverging connections, and converging connections (including colliders).

### Deriving D-Separation Rules from Graphoid Axioms

While the [[graphoid]] axioms do not directly "derive" d-separation rules in a procedural sense (as d-separation is a graphical interpretation of conditional independence specific to DAGs), the principles underlying the axioms are consistent with and support the logic of d-separation. Hereâ€™s an alignment of principles:

- **Symmetry and Decomposition:** Reflect the basic premise of d-separation that if a set \(Z\) blocks a path between \(X\) and \(Y\), it does so irrespective of the direction of inference (Symmetry), and this blocking effect can be decomposed into components of the path (Decomposition).

- **Weak Union and Contraction:** These axioms are analogous to handling diverging and converging paths in d-separation. The Weak Union axiom relates to the idea that adding more conditions (nodes in \(Z\)) can only block more paths, not unblock them, similar to how adding nodes to \(Z\) can block paths through colliders. The Contraction axiom supports the notion that if a path is blocked under certain conditions, adding more nodes to \(Z\) from those conditions maintains the blockage, reflecting the scenario with converging paths (colliders) where conditioning on the common effect or its descendants activates the path.

- **Intersection:** While the intersection axiom may not always apply in probabilistic systems, it reflects scenarios in graphical models where conditioning on common causes or effects influences the independence relations, akin to complex scenarios in d-separation involving colliders and their descendants.

### Practical Alignment

In practice, the application of d-separation to infer conditional independence from a DAG's structure can be viewed as embodying the [[graphoid]] axioms:
- **Path Blocking (Decomposition, Weak Union):** The identification of blocked paths due to conditioned nodes aligns with breaking down independence relations into components and recognizing the cumulative effect of conditioning on multiple variables.
- **Activating Colliders (Contraction):** The specific rule that conditioning on a collider (or its descendants) activates paths aligns with the idea that under certain conditions (additional knowledge), previously independent variables can become dependent, mirroring how additional conditions in the contraction axiom reveal dependencies.

Thus, while d-separation rules are not derived in a mathematical sense from the [[graphoid]] axioms, they are conceptually consistent with these axioms and serve as their application within the structure of graphical models. D-separation operationalizes the abstract principles of conditional independence defined by the [[graphoid]] axioms in a way that is directly applicable to the analysis of DAGs in Bayesian networks and causal models.
