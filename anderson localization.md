Anderson localization


**ASSISTANT**

Anderson localization is a phenomenon in condensed matter physics where the presence of disorder in a system causes the electronic wave functions to become exponentially localized. This phenomenon was first described by Philip W. Anderson in 1958, and it has profound implications for the transport properties of materials. Anderson localization occurs in various contexts, including disordered solids, optical systems, and other wave-based systems.

## Fundamental Concepts

### Disorder and Localization

1. **Disorder**: In a crystalline solid, atoms are arranged in a regular lattice. However, in a disordered system, the positions of atoms or the values of their on-site potentials vary randomly.
2. **Localization**: When disorder is strong enough, the electronic wave functions no longer extend throughout the material but become localized around certain regions. This implies that an electron is essentially trapped in a small region and cannot contribute to electrical conductivity.

### Mathematical Model

The standard model for studying Anderson localization is the Anderson Hamiltonian or the tight-binding model with disorder. In one dimension, it is given by:

$$
H = \sum_{i} \epsilon_i |i\rangle \langle i| + t \sum_{i} (|i\rangle \langle i+1| + |i+1\rangle \langle i|),
$$

where:
- \( \epsilon_i \) are random on-site energies, typically drawn from a probability distribution (e.g., uniform distribution over \([-W/2, W/2]\)).
- \( t \) is the hopping term that represents the probability amplitude for an electron to move to a neighboring site.
- \( |i\rangle \) are the states localized at site \( i \).

### Localization Length

The degree of localization is characterized by the localization length \( \xi \), which measures the spatial extent of the localized states. For an eigenstate \( \psi \) localized around a site \( i \), the amplitude \( \psi_j \) at a distant site \( j \) decays exponentially:

$$
|\psi_j| \sim e^{-|i - j| / \xi}
$$

### Anderson Transition

In dimensions higher than one (e.g., 2D and 3D), there can be a transition from localized to extended states as the disorder strength \( W \) or the energy \( E \) is varied. This transition is known as the Anderson transition, characterized by a critical disorder strength \( W_c \) or critical energy \( E_c \). Below \( W_c \), states are extended, and above \( W_c \), states are localized.

## Numerical Methods

### Transfer Matrix Method

One common numerical approach to study Anderson localization is the [[transfer matrix method]]. This method is used to calculate the localization length \( \xi \) in one-dimensional systems. The Hamiltonian is represented as a product of transfer matrices that describe the evolution of the wave function from one site to the next.

### Finite Size Scaling

In higher dimensions, finite size scaling is used to study the Anderson transition. By analyzing the behavior of the system as a function of the system size, one can determine the critical parameters and the nature of the localization transition.

## Applications and Implications

### Electrical Conductivity

Anderson localization has significant implications for electrical conductivity. In the localized regime, the conductivity is zero at zero temperature, as the electrons cannot move freely through the material. This is in contrast to extended states, where electrons contribute to electrical conductivity.

### Optical Systems

Localization is not limited to electronic systems. It can also occur in optical systems, where light waves become localized due to disorder in the medium. This phenomenon is studied using similar theoretical models and has applications in photonics and waveguide design.

### Quantum Information

In quantum information and quantum computing, Anderson localization can be used to protect quantum states from decoherence. Localized states are less susceptible to perturbations, making them potentially useful for preserving quantum information.

## Example

Consider a one-dimensional Anderson model with random on-site energies:

$$
H = \sum_{i} \epsilon_i |i\rangle \langle i| + t \sum_{i} (|i\rangle \langle i+1| + |i+1\rangle \langle i|),
$$

where \( \epsilon_i \) are drawn from a uniform distribution over \([-W/2, W/2]\). For strong disorder \( W \gg t \), the eigenstates are localized with a localization length \( \xi \) that decreases as \( W \) increases.

### Numerical Simulation

To simulate Anderson localization, one can use the following steps:

1. **Generate Disorder**: Create a random sequence \( \epsilon_i \) for the on-site energies.
2. **Construct Hamiltonian**: Form the Hamiltonian matrix with the given disorder.
3. **Diagonalize**: Solve for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian.
4. **Analyze Localization**: Compute the inverse participation ratio (IPR) to quantify localization. The IPR for an eigenstate \( \psi \) is given by:
   $$
   \text{IPR} = \sum_i |\psi_i|^4
   $$
   A high IPR indicates localization, as the eigenstate is concentrated on fewer sites.
