infinitely differentiable things


**ASSISTANT**

In mathematics, an **infinitely differentiable** function, also known as a $C^\infty$ function, is a function that has derivatives of all orders. These functions play a crucial role in various fields, including analysis, differential equations, and topology. Let's explore this concept in detail.

### Definition

A function \( f : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R} \) is said to be infinitely differentiable if it has derivatives of all orders at every point in its domain. Formally, for every non-negative integer \( k \), the \( k \)-th derivative of \( f \) exists and is continuous. This can be written as:
$$
f \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n)
$$

### Properties

1. **Smoothness**: Infinitely differentiable functions are also called smooth functions because they do not have any abrupt changes in their behavior.

2. **Closed under operations**: The sum, product, and composition of two $C^\infty$ functions are also $C^\infty$. That is, if \( f, g \in C^\infty \), then:
   $$
   f + g \in C^\infty, \quad fg \in C^\infty, \quad f \circ g \in C^\infty
   $$

3. **Taylor Series**: For an infinitely differentiable function, the Taylor series centered at any point \( a \) can be expressed as:
   $$
   T_f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k!} (x - a)^k
   $$
   However, it's important to note that being infinitely differentiable does not necessarily imply that the function is equal to its Taylor series (analyticity).

### Examples

1. **Polynomial functions**: Any polynomial function \( p(x) = a_n x^n + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0 \) is infinitely differentiable because all derivatives exist and are polynomials.

2. **Exponential and trigonometric functions**: The functions \( e^x \), \( \sin(x) \), and \( \cos(x) \) are also infinitely differentiable, as their derivatives repeat in a cyclic manner.

3. **Gaussian function**: The Gaussian function \( f(x) = e^{-x^2} \) is infinitely differentiable. All its derivatives exist and are smooth.

### Non-Examples

1. **Absolute value function**: The function \( f(x) = |x| \) is not infinitely differentiable at \( x = 0 \) because its first derivative does not exist at this point.

2. **Piecewise functions**: Many piecewise-defined functions are not infinitely differentiable at the points where the pieces join, such as \( f(x) = x^2 \) for \( x \ge 0 \) and \( f(x) = -x^2 \) for \( x < 0 \).

### Formalism

Let \( f : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R} \) be a function. The \( k \)-th partial derivative of \( f \) with respect to \( x_i \) is denoted as \( \frac{\partial^k f}{\partial x_i^k} \). The function \( f \) is in \( C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n) \) if, for every multi-index \( \alpha = (\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \ldots, \alpha_n) \) where \( \alpha_i \) are non-negative integers, the partial derivative
$$
\frac{\partial^{|\alpha|} f}{\partial x_1^{\alpha_1} \partial x_2^{\alpha_2} \cdots \partial x_n^{\alpha_n}}
$$
exists and is continuous for all \( x \in \mathbb{R}^n \).

Here, \( |\alpha| = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \cdots + \alpha_n \) denotes the order of the derivative.

### Applications

- **[[Differential Equations]]**: Solutions to differential equations often require the functions involved to be infinitely differentiable.
- **[[Differential Geometry]]**: Smooth manifolds are modeled using \( C^\infty \) functions, ensuring the differentiability of charts and transitions between them.
- **[[Functional Analysis]]**: The space of \( C^\infty \) functions, \( C^\infty(\Omega) \), where \( \Omega \) is an open subset of \( \mathbb{R}^n \), is studied for its topological and algebraic properties.

Infinitely differentiable functions form a foundational concept in mathematical analysis and its applications, providing a bridge between algebraic structures and geometric interpretations.
