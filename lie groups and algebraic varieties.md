### Lie Groups and Algebraic Varieties

The action of Lie groups on algebraic varieties and the corresponding representations play a key role in understanding geometric structures. This interplay between algebraic geometry and Lie theory helps to classify and analyze the symmetry properties of geometric objects.

### Algebraic Varieties

An **algebraic variety** is a geometric object defined as the solution set of a system of polynomial equations. More formally, an algebraic variety $V$ in an affine space $\mathbb{A}^n$ is the set of common zeros of a collection of polynomials $\{f_i(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)\} \subset k[x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n]$, where $k$ is an algebraically closed field.

### Lie Group Actions

A **Lie group action** on an algebraic variety $V$ is a smooth map $\phi: G \times V \to V$ such that for all $g, h \in G$ and $v \in V$,
1. $\phi(e, v) = v$ (where $e$ is the identity element of $G$),
2. $\phi(g, \phi(h, v)) = \phi(gh, v)$.

This action allows us to study how the group $G$ transforms the variety $V$. The orbits of this action partition the variety into subsets that are invariant under the group action.

### Representations in Algebraic Geometry

In the context of algebraic geometry, representations of Lie groups manifest as linear actions on the coordinate ring of the variety or on vector bundles over the variety. For a Lie group $G$ acting on a variety $V$, the action induces a representation on the space of regular functions $\mathcal{O}(V)$.

### Examples

#### Example 1: Linear Algebraic Groups

A **linear algebraic group** is a subgroup of $GL(n, k)$ that is also an algebraic variety. For instance, the general linear group $GL(n, k)$ itself can be considered a linear algebraic group. The action of $GL(n, k)$ on $\mathbb{A}^n$ is given by matrix multiplication:
$$ g \cdot v = g v \quad \text{for } g \in GL(n, k) \text{ and } v \in \mathbb{A}^n. $$

#### Example 2: Projective Varieties

Consider the projective space $\mathbb{P}^n$ and the action of $SL(n+1, k)$ on $\mathbb{P}^n$ by projective transformations. This action helps to study the symmetries and geometric properties of projective varieties, such as curves and surfaces.

### Geometric Structures and Symmetries

Understanding the action of Lie groups on algebraic varieties provides deep insights into the geometric structures of these varieties. For instance, the classification of algebraic surfaces or higher-dimensional varieties often involves studying their automorphism groups, which are typically Lie groups.

### Homogeneous Spaces

A **homogeneous space** is a variety $V$ on which a Lie group $G$ acts transitively. This means that for any two points $v_1, v_2 \in V$, there exists a $g \in G$ such that $g \cdot v_1 = v_2$. Homogeneous spaces are important in the study of geometric structures because they exhibit high degrees of symmetry. A classic example is the action of the orthogonal group $O(n)$ on the sphere $S^{n-1}$.

### Representation Theory and Geometric Structures

The representation theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras aids in understanding the geometric properties of algebraic varieties. Representations describe how the coordinates of the variety transform under the group action, providing tools to analyze invariant properties and decompose the space into simpler components.

#### Cohomology and Sheaves

In algebraic geometry, the use of cohomology and sheaf theory is central to studying the properties of varieties. Lie group actions on varieties induce actions on their cohomology groups, allowing for the application of representation theory to solve geometric problems. For example, the decomposition of the cohomology of a homogeneous space often involves representations of the acting Lie group.

### Applications

- **Invariant Theory**: The study of polynomial functions on a variety that remain invariant under the action of a Lie group.
- **Moduli Spaces**: Parameter spaces for certain classes of algebraic varieties or geometric structures, where the action of a Lie group often plays a crucial role.
- **Symplectic Geometry**: The study of symplectic manifolds, where Lie group actions and their moment maps are essential tools.
