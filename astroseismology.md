## Astroseismology

### Introduction
Astroseismology, often referred to as asteroseismology, is the study of oscillations in stars. By analyzing these oscillations, scientists can infer details about the internal structure and dynamics of stars, akin to how seismologists study earthquakes to understand Earth's interior. The primary goal is to decipher the stellar properties such as internal composition, age, and evolutionary state.

### Stellar Oscillations
Stellar oscillations are waves that propagate through a star, caused by fluctuations in pressure, gravity, and other forces. These oscillations are primarily classified into three types based on the restoring force:

1. **Pressure Modes (p-modes)**:
   - Restoring Force: Pressure
   - Propagation: Predominantly in the outer layers where pressure gradients are significant.
   - Frequency: Higher frequencies
   - Analogous to sound waves, these are typically observed in [[solar-like oscillations]].

2. **Gravity Modes (g-modes)**:
   - Restoring Force: Buoyancy (gravity)
   - Propagation: Predominantly in the core where the buoyancy force is strong.
   - Frequency: Lower frequencies
   - Commonly found in white dwarfs and massive stars during their late evolutionary stages.

3. **Mixed Modes**:
   - Combination of pressure and gravity modes.
   - These occur in stars where both pressure and buoyancy forces influence the oscillations, often found in red giants.

### Mathematical Formulation

The oscillations in a star can be described by the perturbation of the star's equilibrium state. The displacement vector $\vec{\xi}$ represents the deviation from equilibrium. The equations governing the stellar oscillations can be derived from the linearized equations of hydrodynamics and are given by:

$$
\rho \frac{\partial^2 \vec{\xi}}{\partial t^2} = - \nabla P' + \rho' \vec{g} + \vec{f}_\text{non-adiabatic}
$$

Where:
- $\rho$ is the density.
- $P'$ is the perturbed pressure.
- $\rho'$ is the perturbed density.
- $\vec{g}$ is the gravitational acceleration.
- $\vec{f}_\text{non-adiabatic}$ represents non-adiabatic forces.

The perturbed pressure $P'$ and density $\rho'$ are related to the displacement vector $\vec{\xi}$ by:

$$
P' = - \vec{\xi} \cdot \nabla P
$$

$$
\rho' = - \nabla \cdot (\rho \vec{\xi})
$$

### Normal Modes and Eigenfrequencies

To solve the oscillation equations, we often assume a harmonic time dependence of the form $\vec{\xi}(\vec{r}, t) = \vec{\xi}(\vec{r}) e^{i\omega t}$, where $\omega$ is the angular frequency of the oscillation. Substituting this into the linearized hydrodynamic equations results in an eigenvalue problem:

$$
\mathcal{L}(\vec{\xi}) = - \omega^2 \vec{\xi}
$$

Here, $\mathcal{L}$ is a linear differential operator that encapsulates the properties of the star. Solving this eigenvalue problem yields the eigenfrequencies $\omega$ and the corresponding eigenfunctions $\vec{\xi}$, which describe the normal modes of the star.

### Observational Techniques

#### Photometry
Photometry involves measuring the star's brightness variations over time. Oscillations cause periodic changes in brightness, allowing the determination of the frequencies of the stellar oscillations.

#### Spectroscopy
Spectroscopy involves analyzing the Doppler shifts in the star's spectral lines caused by the oscillatory motions. This technique provides additional information about the star's surface movements and internal velocity fields.

### Applications

1. **Stellar Structure and Evolution**:
   - By studying the oscillation modes, we can infer the internal structure of stars, including core composition, density profiles, and temperature gradients. This helps refine models of stellar evolution.

2. **Exoplanet Studies**:
   - Precise measurements of stellar oscillations improve the determination of stellar parameters, which in turn enhance the accuracy of exoplanet properties derived from transit and radial velocity methods.

3. **Age Determination**:
   - Astroseismology provides a means to estimate the ages of stars with high precision by comparing observed oscillation frequencies with theoretical models.

### Conclusion
Astroseismology is a powerful tool in astrophysics, offering a window into the otherwise inaccessible interiors of stars. By interpreting the oscillation patterns observed on stellar surfaces, scientists can gain profound insights into stellar physics and the lifecycle of stars.
