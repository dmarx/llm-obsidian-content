walk me through the lifecycles of some of these examples to help me understand how this all worked procedurally


**ASSISTANT**

Understanding the procedural lifecycles of various initiatives within Wikipedia can provide valuable insight into how the community and Wikimedia Foundation (WMF) handle changes, improvements, and conflicts. Let's walk through the lifecycles of some key examples: Flagged Revisions, Superprotect, VisualEditor, and the Article Feedback Tool.

### Flagged Revisions (Pending Changes)

**Objective**: To ensure that edits made to certain pages would not be visible to the public until reviewed and approved by experienced editors, thus improving content reliability and reducing vandalism.

#### Lifecycle:
1. **Proposal and Community Discussion**:
   - The idea of Flagged Revisions was first proposed in 2008, primarily to combat vandalism on high-profile pages.
   - Extensive discussions took place on Wikipedia's forums and mailing lists to gather community input and gauge support.

2. **Initial Implementation**:
   - Flagged Revisions were first implemented on the German Wikipedia in 2008 as a trial.
   - The system was designed to allow experienced users to review and approve changes before they became visible to the public.

3. **Evaluation and Feedback**:
   - The German Wikipedia's experience was monitored closely, and the system was generally well-received, reducing vandalism effectively.
   - Based on this positive feedback, the English Wikipedia began considering the system, renaming it to "Pending Changes."

4. **Pilot on English Wikipedia**:
   - In 2010, Pending Changes was deployed on a limited number of articles on the English Wikipedia as a pilot project.
   - The pilot included a feedback phase where the community provided input on the system’s effectiveness and usability.

5. **Community Response and Adjustments**:
   - Feedback was mixed, with some praising the reduction in visible vandalism and others criticizing the increased workload for reviewers and delays in visible updates.
   - Various adjustments were made, including tweaking the criteria for when and how Pending Changes would be applied.

6. **Long-Term Implementation**:
   - Pending Changes were not adopted universally across all articles. Instead, it was selectively used on high-traffic or controversial pages.
   - The system remains in use but in a more limited capacity than initially envisioned, balancing the benefits of review with the need for timely updates.

### Superprotect

**Objective**: To provide Wikimedia Foundation staff with a tool to protect pages in a way that even administrators could not override, intended for urgent interventions.

#### Lifecycle:
1. **Proposal and Rationale**:
   - In 2014, the WMF introduced Superprotect during a conflict over the implementation of the Media Viewer feature.
   - The rationale was to ensure that critical software features could be deployed and protected from local administrator actions.

2. **Implementation and Activation**:
   - Superprotect was activated, allowing WMF staff to enforce the deployment of the Media Viewer against local opposition.
   - This action protected specific pages and configurations from being edited by administrators.

3. **Community Backlash**:
   - The introduction of Superprotect sparked significant controversy and backlash within the community.
   - Many editors saw it as a violation of the principle of community self-governance and autonomy.

4. **Petitions and Protests**:
   - The German Wikipedia community and others formally requested the removal of Superprotect.
   - Discussions and protests took place on various Wikimedia platforms, highlighting the tensions between the WMF and the community.

5. **Reversion and Removal**:
   - In response to the sustained community outcry, the WMF deprecated Superprotect in 2015.
   - The decision was made to respect community governance and seek alternative ways to manage critical interventions.

### VisualEditor

**Objective**: To create a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor to simplify editing for newcomers, reducing the learning curve associated with Wikipedia's wikitext markup.

#### Lifecycle:
1. **Development and Testing**:
   - Development of VisualEditor began around 2011, aiming to provide a more user-friendly editing interface.
   - Initial testing was conducted in beta form, allowing users to try the new editor and provide feedback.

2. **Rollout and Early Feedback**:
   - VisualEditor was rolled out to the English Wikipedia in 2013 as the default editor for new and anonymous users.
   - Early feedback highlighted significant bugs, performance issues, and a general preference for the traditional wikitext editor.

3. **Community Resistance and Adjustments**:
   - Many experienced editors resisted the change, citing concerns over stability and functionality.
   - The WMF made numerous adjustments based on feedback, but issues persisted.

4. **Reversion from Default**:
   - Due to ongoing problems and strong community opposition, VisualEditor was removed as the default editor in late 2013.
   - It remained available as an opt-in feature, allowing users to choose their preferred editing interface.

5. **Continued Development and Support**:
   - Despite the reversion, the WMF continued to improve VisualEditor based on user feedback.
   - It remains available and has seen incremental improvements, though the classic wikitext editor is still preferred by many long-term editors.

### Article Feedback Tool

**Objective**: To allow readers to provide feedback on the quality of Wikipedia articles, helping editors identify areas for improvement.

#### Lifecycle:
1. **Proposal and Development**:
   - The Article Feedback Tool was developed to engage readers and provide a mechanism for feedback on article content.
   - Initial versions allowed users to rate articles on several dimensions such as accuracy, completeness, and neutrality.

2. **Deployment and Iteration**:
   - The tool was deployed on the English Wikipedia in phases, starting with a small set of articles and gradually expanding.
   - Early iterations faced issues with low-quality feedback and spam, prompting several redesigns.

3. **Mixed Reception and Challenges**:
   - While some useful feedback was collected, much of the input was deemed unhelpful or off-topic.
   - Editors found it challenging to sift through the volume of feedback to find actionable suggestions.

4. **Evaluation and Decision to Phase Out**:
   - After extensive evaluation, it was decided that the tool did not provide sufficient value relative to the maintenance burden it created.
   - In 2014, the Article Feedback Tool was phased out, with discussions continuing about alternative methods for engaging readers.

### Conclusion

These examples illustrate the procedural lifecycle of various initiatives within Wikipedia, highlighting the iterative nature of development, the importance of community feedback, and the challenges of balancing innovation with established practices. By understanding these lifecycles, we gain insight into how Wikipedia manages change and maintains its collaborative environment. Each initiative reflects the community’s commitment to transparency, inclusivity, and continuous improvement. For further study, consider exploring the detailed histories and discussions around each of these initiatives on Wikipedia’s own documentation and project pages.
