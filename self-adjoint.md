self-adjoint


**ASSISTANT**

In mathematics, particularly in linear algebra and functional analysis, a **self-adjoint** operator (or Hermitian operator) on a Hilbert space is an important concept that has wide applications in quantum mechanics, spectral theory, and differential equations. To discuss this concept, it's important to establish its context and formal definition within the framework of [[linear operators]] on complex Hilbert spaces.

### Definition

A linear operator $A$ on a Hilbert space $H$ is called **self-adjoint** if it satisfies:
$$ A = A^* $$
where $A^*$ is the adjoint of $A$. This definition implies that for all vectors $x, y$ in $H$, we have:
$$ \langle Ax, y \rangle = \langle x, Ay \rangle $$
Here, $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle$ denotes the inner product in $H$, which is typically complex-valued.

### Mathematical Formalism

#### Adjoint Operators
For a linear operator $A : H \to H$, the adjoint $A^*$ is defined by the condition:
$$ \langle Ax, y \rangle = \langle x, A^*y \rangle \quad \text{for all } x, y \in H $$
The existence of $A^*$ depends on $A$ being densely defined, meaning its domain $\text{Dom}(A)$ is dense in $H$.

#### Self-Adjointness Criteria
- **Symmetry:** $A$ is symmetric if $\langle Ax, y \rangle = \langle x, Ay \rangle$ for all $x, y \in \text{Dom}(A)$.
- **Extension to the Adjoints Domain:** For $A$ to be self-adjoint, not only must it be symmetric, but its domain must equal the domain of its adjoint: $\text{Dom}(A) = \text{Dom}(A^*)$.

### Examples and Applications

1. **Quantum Mechanics:** In quantum mechanics, observables (like momentum, position, and energy) are represented by self-adjoint operators. The spectral properties of these operators determine the possible measurement outcomes.

2. **Differential Operators:** The differential operator $A = -\frac{d^2}{dx^2}$ on $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ can be made self-adjoint under appropriate boundary conditions. For example, imposing periodic boundary conditions on an interval transforms $A$ into a self-adjoint operator, whose eigenvalues and eigenfunctions can be explicitly calculated.

3. **Matrix Representation:** If $H = \mathbb{C}^n$ and the inner product is the standard dot product, a matrix $A$ is self-adjoint if $A = A^\dagger$, where $A^\dagger$ (the conjugate transpose of $A$) equals $A$.

### Importance in Spectral Theory

The spectral theory of self-adjoint operators is rich and well-developed because these operators guarantee real eigenvalues and an orthogonal system of eigenvectors (or eigenfunctions in the infinite-dimensional case). This orthogonality is crucial for many applications, such as solving linear differential equations, performing Fourier analysis, and formulating quantum states and dynamics.

Self-adjoint operators provide a robust framework for addressing many problems across physics and engineering, highlighting their foundational role in mathematical physics and applied mathematics. Understanding their properties and applications is key to advancing both theoretical and applied sciences.
