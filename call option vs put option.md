call option vs put option


**ASSISTANT**

A **call option** and a **put option** are two fundamental types of financial derivatives in the options market. Both provide the holder with the right (but not the obligation) to engage in a transaction involving an underlying asset, typically a stock, index, or commodity, at a predetermined price before or at a specified expiration date. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

---

### **Call Option**
- **Definition**: A call option gives the holder the right (but not the obligation) to buy the underlying asset at the strike price on or before the expiration date.
- **Payoff**: The payoff for a call option is positively related to the price of the underlying asset. If the market price of the underlying asset exceeds the strike price, the call option becomes valuable ("in the money").
  $$ \text{Payoff (Call)} = \max(S_T - K, 0) $$
  where:
  - \( S_T \): Price of the underlying asset at expiration
  - \( K \): Strike price of the option
- **Profit**: The net profit considers the premium \( P \) paid for the option:
  $$ \text{Profit (Call)} = \max(S_T - K, 0) - P $$
- **Use Case**: Call options are often used by investors who expect the price of the underlying asset to rise.

### **Put Option**
- **Definition**: A put option gives the holder the right (but not the obligation) to sell the underlying asset at the strike price on or before the expiration date.
- **Payoff**: The payoff for a put option is positively related to the price decrease of the underlying asset. If the market price of the underlying asset falls below the strike price, the put option becomes valuable ("in the money").
  $$ \text{Payoff (Put)} = \max(K - S_T, 0) $$
- **Profit**: The net profit accounts for the premium \( P \) paid for the option:
  $$ \text{Profit (Put)} = \max(K - S_T, 0) - P $$
- **Use Case**: Put options are commonly used by investors who expect the price of the underlying asset to fall or as a form of insurance against a decline in asset value.

### **Key Differences**
| Feature             | Call Option                      | Put Option                        |
|---------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Right Provided**  | Right to **buy** the asset       | Right to **sell** the asset       |
| **Bullish/Bearish** | Bullish (expect price increase)  | Bearish (expect price decrease)   |
| **Payoff Function** | \( \max(S_T - K, 0) \)          | \( \max(K - S_T, 0) \)           |
| **Max Loss**        | Premium \( P \) paid            | Premium \( P \) paid             |
| **Max Gain**        | Theoretically unlimited          | Limited to \( K - P \)           |

### **Graphical Representation**
The payoff functions for call and put options can be represented graphically. For a call, the payoff rises steeply once \( S_T > K \), while for a put, the payoff rises steeply once \( S_T < K \). Both options lose value by the amount of the premium when \( S_T \) is unfavorable to the holder.
