Several politicians and organizations have recently engaged in promoting portable benefits as a response to changes in the workforce and as a potential pathway toward broader reforms like universal healthcare.

Senator Mark Warner and Congresswoman Suzan DelBene have been active proponents of portable benefits at the federal level. They introduced legislation such as the "Portable Benefits for Independent Workers Pilot Program Act," aimed at creating a more flexible benefits system where benefits are attached to the individual rather than the job. This legislative effort is seen as a response to the changing nature of work, particularly the rise of gig and freelance employment, which typically does not offer traditional employment benefits【57†source】.

Additionally, the Aspen Institute has been a significant player in fostering the conversation and development of portable benefits policies. They have conducted research and provided resources aimed at understanding the best practices for implementing portable benefits. Their efforts emphasize the necessity of benefits that are portable, prorated, and universal to adapt to the dynamic labor market【56†source】.

State-level initiatives also reflect a growing interest in this approach. For example, Washington State has seen legislative efforts to create systems of portable benefits for independent workers, indicating a grassroots approach to tackling this issue alongside federal initiatives【57†source】.

These efforts by both politicians and think tanks demonstrate a concerted push to adapt the benefits system to modern economic realities, potentially paving the way for larger systemic reforms such as universal healthcare.
