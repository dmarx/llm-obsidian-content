It looks like there might have been a formatting issue with your question. If you're asking about the details of how Hoeffding's Inequality provides bounds on the probability that the sum of random variables deviates from its expected value, here’s a more detailed explanation:

### Understanding Hoeffding's Inequality

Hoeffding's Inequality gives a probabilistic bound on the deviation of the sum of independent bounded random variables from their expected value. Specifically, it addresses the sum \( S_n = \sum_{i=1}^n X_i \) of independent random variables \( X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n \), where each \( X_i \) is bounded by known constants \( a_i \leq X_i \leq b_i \).

### Mathematical Statement

The formal statement of Hoeffding's Inequality is as follows:
$$
\mathbb{P}(S_n - \mathbb{E}[S_n] \geq t) \leq \exp\left(-\frac{2t^2}{\sum_{i=1}^n (b_i - a_i)^2}\right)
$$
and symmetrically,
$$
\mathbb{P}(S_n - \mathbb{E}[S_n] \leq -t) \leq \exp\left(-\frac{2t^2}{\sum_{i=1}^n (b_i - a_i)^2}\right)
$$

### Explanation

- **\( S_n \)** is the sum of the random variables \( X_1, \ldots, X_n \).
- **\( \mathbb{E}[S_n] \)** is the expected value of this sum.
- **\( t \)** is a positive threshold specifying the amount by which \( S_n \) might deviate from \( \mathbb{E}[S_n] \).
- **\( a_i, b_i \)** are the bounds on each \( X_i \), which confine the individual variables to a known range.

The term \( \frac{2t^2}{\sum_{i=1}^n (b_i - a_i)^2} \) in the exponent of the bound reflects the combined effect of the range width \( b_i - a_i \) of each variable and the size of the deviation \( t \). A wider range or a smaller deviation \( t \) leads to a less tight (higher) bound, indicating that larger deviations are less likely as the bounds on the variables tighten or as \( t \) increases.

### Practical Implications

This inequality is particularly useful because it does not require any assumptions about the specific distribution of the variables \( X_i \) beyond their boundedness. It's applied in various areas like:
- **Statistical inference**, where it helps in establishing confidence intervals.
- **Machine learning**, particularly in deriving guarantees on the performance of learning algorithms over finite sample sizes.
- **Risk assessment** in finance and insurance, where bounding the deviations of sums from expected values is crucial.

By setting practical values for \( t \) and knowing the bounds \( a_i \) and \( b_i \), one can use Hoeffding's Inequality to compute probabilities that quantify the reliability of empirical estimates against their theoretical expectations. This is a powerful tool in ensuring robust statistical conclusions and in designing systems that must perform reliably under uncertainty.
