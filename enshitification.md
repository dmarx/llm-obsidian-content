# Enshitification

A term coined by [[Cory Doctorow]] describing the predictable lifecycle of [[digital platforms]] wherein they progressively degrade in quality and utility through a three-phase process of [[value extraction]].

## Formal Model

Let's define a mathematical framework for modeling enshitification:

Let P be a platform with three stakeholder groups:
- C: Consumers
- B: Business users
- S: Shareholders

Define utility functions for each group:
```
UC(t): Utility for consumers at time t
UB(t): Utility for business users at time t
US(t): Shareholder value at time t
```

## Phase Transitions

### Phase 1: Consumer Capture
Platform maximizes UC while maintaining minimal viable UB:
```
max UC(t) subject to UB(t) ≥ β
```
where β represents minimum business participation threshold

### Phase 2: Business Capture
Once [[network effects]] create sufficient [[consumer lock-in]], platform shifts to maximizing UB while degrading UC to maximum tolerable level:
```
max UB(t) subject to UC(t) ≥ γ
```
where γ represents consumer retention threshold

### Phase 3: Value Extraction
Platform maximizes US by degrading both UC and UB to minimum viable levels:
```
max US(t) subject to:
UC(t) ≥ γ
UB(t) ≥ β
```

## Key Characteristics

### Switching Costs
Let SC(t) represent consumer switching costs at time t:
```
SC(t) = f(D(t), N(t), A(t))
```
where:
- D(t): Data lock-in
- N(t): Network effect strength
- A(t): Alternative platform availability

### Quality Degradation Function
The rate of service quality decline Q(t):
```
Q(t) = Q₀e^(-λt)
```
where:
- Q₀: Initial quality
- λ: Degradation rate parameter
