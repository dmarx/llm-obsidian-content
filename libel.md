**USER**

libel


**ASSISTANT**

**Libel** is a form of defamation involving false and harmful statements made in a fixed medium, typically written, but it can also include pictures, signs, or electronic broadcasts. Unlike slander, which pertains to spoken defamation, libel is generally more permanent and can reach a broader audience.

### Characteristics of Libel

1. **Fixed Medium**: Libel involves statements in written or published forms, such as newspapers, books, websites, or social media.
2. **Falsity**: The statements made must be false.
3. **Defamatory Nature**: The statements must harm the reputation of the person or entity targeted.
4. **Publication**: The statements must be communicated to a third party.
5. **Fault**: There must be some degree of fault, ranging from negligence to actual malice, depending on whether the plaintiff is a private individual or a public figure.
6. **Harm**: The plaintiff must show that the defamatory statement caused harm, although some types of statements are considered so damaging that harm is presumed ([[libel per se]]).

### Legal Context

Libel is actionable under defamation law, with the following key elements typically required to establish a case:

- **A False Statement**: The statement must be demonstrably false.
- **Publication**: The statement must be made available to at least one person other than the plaintiff.
- **Fault**: There must be a level of fault, with public figures needing to prove actual malice (knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for the truth), while private individuals may only need to show negligence.
- **Harm**: The plaintiff must demonstrate that the statement caused harm to their reputation, although in cases of [[libel per se]], harm is presumed.

### Types of Libel

Libel is categorized into two primary types:

1. **Libel Per Se**: Statements that are inherently defamatory and presumed to cause harm, such as allegations of criminal behavior, loathsome diseases, professional incompetence, or immoral conduct.
2. **Libel Per Quod**: Statements that require extrinsic evidence to prove their defamatory nature and the harm caused.

### Analogies in Mathematical and Statistical Contexts

In mathematics and statistics, libel can be loosely analogized to the dissemination of erroneous data or conclusions, which can mislead and damage the reputation of researchers or institutions. Examples include:

- **Data Fabrication**: Creating false data that misrepresents research findings, similar to libelous statements that misrepresent facts.
- **Data Falsification**: Manipulating data to produce desired outcomes, akin to making libelous alterations to truthfully harm someone's reputation.

### Ethical Considerations

In [[research ethics]], libelous actions might correspond to publishing false accusations or incorrect critiques of another's work, which can unjustly harm their professional reputation. Upholding accuracy, honesty, and integrity in all forms of communication is critical to maintaining the credibility of scientific and academic communities.

### Related Topics

- [[Defamation]]: The overarching legal category that includes both libel and slander.
- [[Slander]]: The spoken form of defamation.
- [[Calumny]]: A term emphasizing the malicious intent behind defamation.
- [[Ethics in Research]]: Ensuring truthfulness and integrity in academic and scientific publications.

### Summary

Libel is a serious form of defamation involving false and harmful written or published statements. It is more enduring than slander and can reach a larger audience, making it potentially more damaging. Understanding libel's characteristics, legal requirements, and ethical implications helps in recognizing and preventing such harmful actions, similar to identifying and rectifying errors in scientific research and data dissemination.
