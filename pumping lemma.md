Pumping lemma


**ASSISTANT**

The **Pumping Lemma** is a fundamental property used in formal language theory to prove that certain languages are not regular or not context-free. There are two main versions of the pumping lemma: one for regular languages and one for context-free languages. Each lemma provides a condition that must be satisfied by all strings in the respective types of languages, and these conditions are often used to demonstrate that a given language does not meet the criteria for regularity or context-freeness.

### Pumping Lemma for Regular Languages

The pumping lemma for regular languages states that for any regular language, there exists a constant $p$ (the pumping length) such that any string $s$ in the language with length at least $p$ can be divided into three parts, $s = xyz$, satisfying the following conditions:

1. $|xy| \leq p$
2. $|y| \geq 1$
3. For all $k \geq 0$, the string $xy^kz$ is also in the language.

### Formal Statement

Let $L$ be a regular language. Then there exists a pumping length $p$ such that for any string $s \in L$ with $|s| \geq p$, $s$ can be decomposed into $s = xyz$ such that:

1. $|xy| \leq p$
2. $|y| \geq 1$
3. $\forall k \geq 0, xy^kz \in L$

### Proof Technique Using the Pumping Lemma

To use the pumping lemma to prove that a language $L$ is not regular:

1. **Assume** $L$ is regular.
2. Let $p$ be the pumping length given by the pumping lemma.
3. **Choose** a string $s \in L$ such that $|s| \geq p$.
4. **Show** that for any decomposition of $s$ into $xyz$ where $|xy| \leq p$ and $|y| \geq 1$, there exists some $k \geq 0$ for which $xy^kz \notin L$.
5. **Conclude** that $L$ is not regular because it fails to satisfy the pumping lemma.

### Example

Consider the language $L = \{a^n b^n \mid n \geq 0\}$.

1. Assume $L$ is regular.
2. Let $p$ be the pumping length.
3. Choose $s = a^p b^p$ such that $|s| \geq p$.
4. According to the pumping lemma, $s$ can be decomposed into $xyz$ with $|xy| \leq p$ and $|y| \geq 1$. Since $|xy| \leq p$, $y$ consists only of $a$s.
5. Let $y = a^k$ where $k \geq 1$. Then $s = a^p b^p$ can be written as $xyz = a^i a^k a^{p-i-k} b^p$.
6. For $k = 0$, the string becomes $xz = a^{p-k} b^p = a^{p-1} b^p$, which is not in $L$ since the number of $a$s does not equal the number of $b$s.
7. This contradicts the pumping lemma, so $L$ is not regular.

### Pumping Lemma for Context-Free Languages

The pumping lemma for context-free languages is more complex and states that for any context-free language, there exists a constant $p$ (the pumping length) such that any string $s$ in the language with length at least $p$ can be divided into five parts, $s = uvwxy$, satisfying the following conditions:

1. $|vwx| \leq p$
2. $|vx| \geq 1$
3. For all $k \geq 0$, the string $uv^k wx^k y$ is also in the language.

### Formal Statement

Let $L$ be a context-free language. Then there exists a pumping length $p$ such that for any string $s \in L$ with $|s| \geq p$, $s$ can be decomposed into $s = uvwxy$ such that:

1. $|vwx| \leq p$
2. $|vx| \geq 1$
3. $\forall k \geq 0, uv^k wx^k y \in L$

### Proof Technique Using the Context-Free Pumping Lemma

To use the pumping lemma to prove that a language $L$ is not context-free:

1. **Assume** $L$ is context-free.
2. Let $p$ be the pumping length given by the pumping lemma.
3. **Choose** a string $s \in L$ such that $|s| \geq p$.
4. **Show** that for any decomposition of $s$ into $uvwxy$ where $|vwx| \leq p$ and $|vx| \geq 1$, there exists some $k \geq 0$ for which $uv^k wx^k y \notin L$.
5. **Conclude** that $L$ is not context-free because it fails to satisfy the pumping lemma.

### Example

Consider the language $L = \{a^n b^n c^n \mid n \geq 0\}$.

1. Assume $L$ is context-free.
2. Let $p$ be the pumping length.
3. Choose $s = a^p b^p c^p$ such that $|s| \geq p$.
4. According to the pumping lemma, $s$ can be decomposed into $uvwxy$ with $|vwx| \leq p$ and $|vx| \geq 1$.
5. Since $|vwx| \leq p$, $vwx$ can only contain at most two types of symbols (either $a$s and $b$s or $b$s and $c$s).
6. When pumping $uv^k wx^k y$, it will disrupt the balance between $a$s, $b$s, and $c$s. For example, if $v$ and $x$ contain only $a$s and $b$s, then $uv^2 wx^2 y$ will have more $a$s and $b$s than $c$s.
7. This contradicts the lemma, so $L$ is not context-free.
