partial derivatives


**ASSISTANT**

Partial derivatives are fundamental concepts in multivariable calculus, used to describe how a function of several variables changes as each variable is varied independently. They are critical in optimization, differential equations, and various applications in science and engineering.

### Definition and Notation

Given a function \( f \) of multiple variables, \( f(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) \), the partial derivative of \( f \) with respect to \( x_i \) (where \( i \) is one of the indices of the variables) is the derivative of \( f \) while keeping all other variables constant.

The partial derivative of \( f \) with respect to \( x_i \) is denoted by:
$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} \quad \text{or} \quad f_{x_i}.
$$

### Formal Definition

The partial derivative of \( f \) with respect to \( x_i \) at the point \((x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)\) is defined as:
$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) = \lim_{\Delta x_i \to 0} \frac{f(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_i + \Delta x_i, \ldots, x_n) - f(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_i, \ldots, x_n)}{\Delta x_i}.
$$

This definition captures the rate of change of \( f \) in the direction of \( x_i \) while holding all other variables fixed.

### Examples

#### Example 1: Function of Two Variables

Consider the function \( f(x, y) = x^2y + y^3 \).

1. **Partial derivative with respect to \( x \):**
   $$
   \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} (x^2y + y^3) = 2xy.
   $$

2. **Partial derivative with respect to \( y \):**
   $$
   \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial}{\partial y} (x^2y + y^3) = x^2 + 3y^2.
   $$

#### Example 2: Function of Three Variables

Consider the function \( g(x, y, z) = x^2y + yz + e^{xz} \).

1. **Partial derivative with respect to \( x \):**
   $$
   \frac{\partial g}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} (x^2y + yz + e^{xz}) = 2xy + z e^{xz}.
   $$

2. **Partial derivative with respect to \( y \):**
   $$
   \frac{\partial g}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial}{\partial y} (x^2y + yz + e^{xz}) = x^2 + z.
   $$

3. **Partial derivative with respect to \( z \):**
   $$
   \frac{\partial g}{\partial z} = \frac{\partial}{\partial z} (x^2y + yz + e^{xz}) = y + x e^{xz}.
   $$

### Higher-Order Partial Derivatives

Just like single-variable functions, multivariable functions can have higher-order partial derivatives. The second-order partial derivatives involve taking the partial derivative of the partial derivative. For instance, for a function \( f(x, y) \), we have:

1. **Second-order partial derivative with respect to \( x \):**
   $$
   \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2}.
   $$

2. **Mixed partial derivative with respect to \( x \) and then \( y \):**
   $$
   \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x \partial y}.
   $$

According to Schwarz's theorem (or Clairaut's theorem), if the second-order mixed partial derivatives are continuous, then the order of differentiation does not matter:
$$
\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x \partial y} = \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y \partial x}.
$$

### Example of Higher-Order Partial Derivatives

Consider \( h(x, y) = x^2 y + \sin(xy) \).

1. **First-order partial derivatives:**
   $$
   \frac{\partial h}{\partial x} = 2xy + y \cos(xy),
   $$
   $$
   \frac{\partial h}{\partial y} = x^2 + x \cos(xy).
   $$

2. **Second-order partial derivatives:**
   $$
   \frac{\partial^2 h}{\partial x^2} = 2y - y^2 \sin(xy),
   $$
   $$
   \frac{\partial^2 h}{\partial y^2} = -x^2 y \sin(xy),
   $$
   $$
   \frac{\partial^2 h}{\partial x \partial y} = 2x + \cos(xy) - xy \sin(xy).
   $$

### Applications of Partial Derivatives

Partial derivatives are widely used in various fields:

1. **Optimization:** In problems involving multiple variables and constraints, partial derivatives are used to find critical points (e.g., using the method of [[Lagrange multipliers]]).
2. **Differential Equations:** Partial differential equations (PDEs) involve partial derivatives of functions with multiple variables, and are used to model phenomena such as heat conduction, wave propagation, and fluid dynamics.
3. **Economics:** Partial derivatives are used in economic models to determine marginal costs and marginal rates of substitution.
4. **Physics:** In physics, partial derivatives describe how physical quantities change with respect to multiple variables, such as in thermodynamics and electromagnetism.

### Conclusion

Partial derivatives extend the concept of differentiation to functions of multiple variables, providing crucial tools for analysis in various scientific and engineering disciplines. They allow us to understand how changes in one variable affect a function while keeping other variables constant, facilitating the study of complex systems and optimization problems.
