The most outstanding work of Rasizade, which gained an international acclaim, was the eponymous algorithm of decline theory, described in his 2008 article at the peak of oil prices, when nothing foreshadowed their steep fall and the subsequent onset of global economic recession with irreversible consequences for oil-exporting nations.[16] Prior to that, the effect of rising oil prices, rendered to strengthen the national currencies and affect the economies of rentier states as a result of oil boom, was described only by the "Dutch disease" theory, first introduced in 1977.[17]

However, this theory could not foretell the further course of events after a drop in oil prices on the world market: what would have turned out for oil-dependent countries upon the end of their oil booms? And precisely that happened in 2008, when the price of oil collapsed from $147 per barrel in the middle of the year to $32 by its end, i.e. by 75 percent.[18] Exactly at that moment came out of press the aforementioned article, in which Rasizade explained the chain reaction of an unavoidable sequence of events in the process of impoverishment, degradation and decline in living standards of nations whose welfare depends on the export of natural resources, when one change inevitably entails another. Appearance of the article was so timely that the described algorithm, which was unfolding in real time, had been picked up in scholarly literature as a typological model by the name of its author.[19]

Rasizade's algorithm may be described succinctly as the following chain reaction: a decline in oil production or a drop in the price of oil translates into a synchronous fall in the inflow of petrodollars, which results in the collapse of treasury's revenues and expenditures, which leads to devaluation of the local currency, which ensues (in a free market) a tumble in prices of goods, services and real estate in dollar terms, which squeezes the tax base, which entails the redundancy of government bureaucracy, nationwide layoffs and bankruptcies in the private sector, which further squeezes the tax base, which results in cutting wages and social benefits, which causes mass unemployment and impoverishment of the populace, which triggers a growing dissatisfaction of power elite, which brings about a regime change with redistribution of wealth and property.

After this, the whole cycle repeats itself on a lower level of revenues and living standards until the final slump of this country into its historically legitimate and economically stable place among the third world nations. This is the final stage of algorithm, after which an industrial development may (or may not, as the experience of backward countries shows) begin in a given state — such a prediction does not lend itself to political or economic calculations and depends on the mentality and traditions of each particular nation. Therefore, after adjusting to the new standards of living, these nations can exist in the condition of entropy indefinitely.[20]


**ASSISTANT**

**Rasizade's algorithm** is a theoretical model that describes the sequence of economic decline in oil-dependent countries following a sharp drop in oil prices or a decline in oil production. This algorithm, named after its author, Dr. Alec Rasizade, gained prominence for predicting the severe economic repercussions experienced by oil-exporting nations during the 2008 financial crisis when oil prices plummeted. Rasizade's model was distinctive because it offered a framework for understanding the systemic collapse of economies heavily reliant on oil exports, extending beyond the scope of the [[Dutch Disease]] theory, which primarily focuses on the effects of rising oil prices.

### Overview of Rasizade's Algorithm

Rasizade's algorithm outlines a **chain reaction** that unfolds when a country that relies heavily on oil exports experiences a significant decrease in oil revenue. The algorithm explains how this shock leads to a cascading series of economic and social disruptions, ultimately resulting in a lower equilibrium of living standards and potentially long-term economic decline. The steps in the algorithm are as follows:

1. **Decline in Oil Production or Drop in Oil Prices**: The algorithm begins with a reduction in oil production or a sharp decline in oil prices. This decrease leads to a significant reduction in the inflow of petrodollars (foreign currency earnings from oil exports).

2. **Fall in Government Revenues and Expenditures**: With reduced petrodollar inflows, the treasury's revenues fall sharply. This decrease in revenue affects the government's ability to maintain its expenditures, including social programs, subsidies, and public sector wages.

3. **Devaluation of the Local Currency**: A drop in foreign currency inflows leads to a decline in demand for the local currency in international markets, causing it to devalue. The devaluation makes imports more expensive, contributing to inflation and reducing the purchasing power of the population.

4. **Decline in Prices of Goods, Services, and Real Estate in Dollar Terms**: As the local currency devalues, the prices of goods, services, and real estate fall in terms of foreign currencies, especially the dollar. This decline can lead to asset deflation and further economic distress.

5. **Squeezing of the Tax Base**: As economic activity slows and the prices of goods and services fall, the tax base contracts. With lower economic output and decreased property values, tax revenues decline further, exacerbating the government's fiscal crisis.

6. **Layoffs and Bankruptcies in the Private Sector**: With reduced government spending and a shrinking economy, both the public and private sectors begin to lay off employees. Businesses face lower demand, leading to bankruptcies and further layoffs.

7. **Cutting Wages and Social Benefits**: The government, facing a budgetary crisis, cuts wages and social benefits to reduce expenditures. This austerity measure leads to reduced consumer spending, further contracting the economy.

8. **Mass Unemployment and Impoverishment**: The combination of layoffs, wage cuts, and reduced social benefits results in mass unemployment and widespread impoverishment of the populace, leading to a significant decline in living standards.

9. **Growing Dissatisfaction and Regime Change**: Economic hardship fuels public dissatisfaction and unrest. As discontent grows among the population and elites, political instability increases, potentially leading to regime change and redistribution of wealth and property.

10. **Repeating Cycle of Decline**: The entire cycle can repeat on a lower economic level if the country's dependence on oil persists without diversification or structural economic reforms. Each iteration of the cycle results in a further decline in revenues and living standards.

11. **Final Equilibrium and Potential for Industrial Development**: Eventually, the country reaches a lower equilibrium where it stabilizes at a reduced level of economic activity and living standards. At this point, the country may begin to pursue industrial development or remain stagnant, depending on its internal conditions and external influences.

### Implications of Rasizade's Algorithm

1. **Understanding Economic Vulnerability**: Rasizade's algorithm highlights the extreme vulnerability of economies that are heavily reliant on a single natural resource, particularly oil. It demonstrates how a shock in oil prices can lead to a systemic collapse in such economies.

2. **Beyond Dutch Disease**: While the [[Dutch Disease]] theory explains the negative effects of a resource boom on the broader economy, Rasizade’s algorithm extends this understanding by detailing what happens when the boom ends. It offers a comprehensive view of the decline process, emphasizing how economic contractions can feed on themselves in resource-dependent states.

3. **Policy Implications**: For policymakers in oil-exporting countries, Rasizade’s algorithm underscores the importance of diversifying the economy and creating buffers against volatile commodity prices. It also suggests the need for structural reforms to reduce reliance on oil revenues and improve fiscal management.

4. **Predictions and Real-World Examples**: The algorithm provides a framework for predicting the potential impacts of declining oil prices on oil-dependent countries. The events following the 2008 oil price crash and the ongoing economic challenges faced by countries like Venezuela and Nigeria illustrate the relevance of Rasizade’s model.

### Conclusion

**Rasizade's algorithm** offers a detailed and systematic model for understanding the economic decline of oil-dependent countries following a drop in oil prices or production. By identifying the sequential chain of events that lead to economic contraction and lower living standards, the algorithm provides valuable insights into the challenges faced by resource-rich nations. It highlights the critical need for economic diversification and robust policy frameworks to mitigate the risks associated with heavy reliance on natural resources.
