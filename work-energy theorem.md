Work-energy theorem


**ASSISTANT**

The *work-energy theorem* is a principle in classical mechanics that states the work done by the net force acting on an object is equal to the change in the object's kinetic energy. This theorem provides a direct relationship between the concepts of work and energy, and it is fundamental in analyzing the dynamics of particles and rigid bodies.

### Formal Statement

Mathematically, the work-energy theorem is expressed as:
$$
W_{\text{net}} = \Delta K = K_f - K_i
$$
where:
- \(W_{\text{net}}\) is the net work done on the object,
- \(\Delta K\) is the change in kinetic energy,
- \(K_f\) is the final kinetic energy,
- \(K_i\) is the initial kinetic energy.

### Derivation

To derive the work-energy theorem, we start with Newton's second law of motion, which states:
$$
\mathbf{F}_{\text{net}} = m \mathbf{a}
$$
where \(\mathbf{F}_{\text{net}}\) is the net force acting on an object, \(m\) is the mass of the object, and \(\mathbf{a}\) is its acceleration.

The work done by the net force as the object moves from position \(\mathbf{r}_i\) to position \(\mathbf{r}_f\) is:
$$
W_{\text{net}} = \int_{\mathbf{r}_i}^{\mathbf{r}_f} \mathbf{F}_{\text{net}} \cdot d\mathbf{r}
$$

Using \(\mathbf{F}_{\text{net}} = m \mathbf{a}\) and noting that acceleration \(\mathbf{a}\) is the time derivative of velocity \(\mathbf{v}\), we can rewrite the force as:
$$
\mathbf{F}_{\text{net}} = m \frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt}
$$

Substituting this into the work integral gives:
$$
W_{\text{net}} = \int_{\mathbf{r}_i}^{\mathbf{r}_f} m \frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt} \cdot d\mathbf{r}
$$

Recognizing that \(d\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{v} \, dt\), the integral becomes:
$$
W_{\text{net}} = \int_{t_i}^{t_f} m \frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt} \cdot \mathbf{v} \, dt
$$

Since \(\frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt} \cdot \mathbf{v} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{d}{dt} (\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{v}) = \frac{1}{2} \frac{d}{dt} (v^2)\), we have:
$$
W_{\text{net}} = \int_{t_i}^{t_f} m \frac{1}{2} \frac{d}{dt} (v^2) \, dt
$$

Simplifying the integral, we get:
$$
W_{\text{net}} = \frac{m}{2} \int_{t_i}^{t_f} \frac{d}{dt} (v^2) \, dt
$$

Integrating \( \frac{d}{dt} (v^2) \) over \( dt \) from \( t_i \) to \( t_f \) yields the change in \( v^2 \):
$$
W_{\text{net}} = \frac{m}{2} \left[ v^2 \right]_{t_i}^{t_f} = \frac{m}{2} (v_f^2 - v_i^2)
$$

Recognizing that the kinetic energy \( K \) is defined as \( K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \), we can express the net work as:
$$
W_{\text{net}} = K_f - K_i = \Delta K
$$

### Interpretation and Applications

- **Interpretation**: The work-energy theorem implies that the net work done by forces on an object results in a change in the object's kinetic energy. If the net work is positive, the object's kinetic energy increases, meaning it speeds up. If the net work is negative, the object's kinetic energy decreases, meaning it slows down.

- **Applications**:
  - **Free Fall**: Consider an object of mass \(m\) falling under the influence of gravity. The work done by gravity as it falls a distance \(h\) is \( W = mgh \). According to the work-energy theorem, this work results in an increase in kinetic energy: \( mgh = \Delta K \).
  - **Springs**: For a spring compressed or extended by a distance \(x\), the work done by the spring force (obeying Hooke's Law) is \( W = \frac{1}{2}kx^2 \). This work changes the kinetic energy of the mass attached to the spring.

### Conclusion

The work-energy theorem is a powerful tool in mechanics, allowing for the analysis of systems where forces and energy transformations play a crucial role. It simplifies the calculation of motion by linking the concepts of work and kinetic energy directly.
