### Key Studies on Minimum Wage and Employment Effects

#### Card and Krueger (1994)
- **Authors**: David Card and Alan B. Krueger
- **Affiliations**: 
  - David Card: University of California, Berkeley
  - Alan B. Krueger: Princeton University
- **Study Title**: "Minimum Wages and Employment: A Case Study of the Fast-Food Industry in New Jersey and Pennsylvania"
- **Vulnerabilities/Bias**: 
  - **Data Collection**: Data was collected through telephone surveys, which might introduce biases related to respondent accuracy or survey methodology.
  - **Geographic Limitation**: Focuses on fast-food restaurants in specific regions, which might not generalize to other industries or areas.
  - **Policy Impact**: The study’s results could be influenced by other regional economic policies or conditions not accounted for in the analysis.

#### Dube, Lester, and Reich (2010)
- **Authors**: Arindrajit Dube, T. William Lester, and Michael Reich
- **Affiliations**: 
  - Arindrajit Dube: University of Massachusetts Amherst
  - T. William Lester: University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
  - Michael Reich: University of California, Berkeley
- **Study Title**: "Minimum Wage Effects Across State Borders: Estimates Using Contiguous Counties"
- **Vulnerabilities/Bias**: 
  - **Methodology**: The use of contiguous counties attempts to control for regional economic differences, but other unobserved factors might still bias results.
  - **Time Frame**: Short-term effects might differ from long-term outcomes, which the study might not fully capture.
  - **Policy Environment**: Differences in state policies beyond minimum wage laws might confound the results.

#### Neumark and Wascher (2007)
- **Authors**: David Neumark and William Wascher
- **Affiliations**: 
  - David Neumark: University of California, Irvine
  - William Wascher: Federal Reserve Board
- **Study Title**: "Minimum Wages and Employment"
- **Vulnerabilities/Bias**: 
  - **Selection Bias**: The authors review a wide range of studies, but their selection and interpretation of studies could be influenced by their theoretical perspectives.
  - **Publication Bias**: Studies finding significant results (positive or negative) might be more likely to be published, skewing the meta-analysis.
  - **Time Period**: The review spans many decades, and changes in labor markets and policies over time might influence the findings.

#### Meer and West (2016)
- **Authors**: Jonathan Meer and Jeremy West
- **Affiliations**: 
  - Jonathan Meer: Texas A&M University
  - Jeremy West: University of California, Santa Cruz
- **Study Title**: "Effects of the Minimum Wage on Employment Dynamics"
- **Vulnerabilities/Bias**: 
  - **Focus on Dynamics**: By focusing on employment growth rather than levels, the study might miss immediate impacts and emphasize longer-term trends.
  - **Data Sources**: The study uses panel data, which might suffer from issues like measurement error or omitted variable bias.
  - **Geographic and Temporal Scope**: Results might be specific to the regions and time periods studied, limiting generalizability.

### General Considerations for Bias and Vulnerabilities

1. **Methodological Differences**: Different studies use various methodologies (e.g., natural experiments, panel data analysis, meta-analysis) which can introduce different types of biases and limitations.
2. **Data Quality**: The reliability and granularity of the data used can significantly affect study outcomes. Poor data quality can lead to inaccurate results.
3. **Researcher Bias**: Researchers’ theoretical predispositions can influence study design, data interpretation, and the framing of results.
4. **Economic Context**: Studies conducted in different economic contexts (e.g., recession vs. growth periods) might yield different results, complicating cross-study comparisons.
5. **Publication Bias**: Studies with significant findings are more likely to be published, which can skew the available literature towards more pronounced effects.

By critically assessing these factors, one can better understand the complexities and potential biases in the research on minimum wage and employment effects. For further reading, it might be beneficial to explore comprehensive [[literature reviews]] and meta-analyses that synthesize findings from multiple studies.
