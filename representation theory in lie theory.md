### Representation Theory in Lie Theory

Representation theory is a fundamental aspect of Lie theory that explores how Lie groups and Lie algebras act on vector spaces. This action provides insights into the structure of the groups and algebras themselves and has widespread applications in mathematics and physics.

### Representations of Lie Groups

A **representation** of a Lie group $G$ on a vector space $V$ is a homomorphism $\rho: G \to GL(V)$, where $GL(V)$ is the group of invertible linear transformations on $V$. This means that each element of $G$ is associated with a linear transformation in such a way that the group operations are preserved. Formally, for any $g_1, g_2 \in G$ and $v \in V$,
$$ \rho(g_1 g_2) = \rho(g_1) \rho(g_2) \quad \text{and} \quad \rho(e) = I, $$
where $e$ is the identity element in $G$ and $I$ is the identity transformation on $V$.

#### Example
Consider the group $SO(3)$, the group of rotations in three-dimensional space. A common representation is the standard representation on $\mathbb{R}^3$, where each rotation matrix acts on $\mathbb{R}^3$ by matrix multiplication.

### Representations of Lie Algebras

For a Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, a **representation** is a homomorphism $\rho: \mathfrak{g} \to \mathfrak{gl}(V)$, where $\mathfrak{gl}(V)$ is the Lie algebra of all endomorphisms of $V$. This homomorphism respects the Lie bracket, meaning for any $X, Y \in \mathfrak{g}$,
$$ \rho([X, Y]) = [\rho(X), \rho(Y)] = \rho(X)\rho(Y) - \rho(Y)\rho(X). $$

#### Example
The adjoint representation of a Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ is a canonical representation where the algebra acts on itself by the adjoint action:
$$ \text{ad}_X(Y) = [X, Y] \quad \text{for all } X, Y \in \mathfrak{g}. $$
Here, $\text{ad}_X$ is a linear map from $\mathfrak{g}$ to $\mathfrak{g}$.

### Irreducible Representations

A representation is **irreducible** if it has no proper, non-zero invariant subspaces under the action of the group or algebra. That is, if $V$ is a vector space and $\rho: G \to GL(V)$ is a representation, $V$ is irreducible if the only subspaces $W \subset V$ such that $\rho(g)W \subseteq W$ for all $g \in G$ are $W = \{0\}$ and $W = V$.

### Characters

The **character** of a representation is a function $\chi_\rho: G \to \mathbb{C}$ defined by
$$ \chi_\rho(g) = \text{Tr}(\rho(g)), $$
where $\text{Tr}$ denotes the trace of a matrix. Characters provide a powerful tool for analyzing representations because they encode significant information about the representation.

### Applications

#### Quantum Mechanics
In quantum mechanics, particles and their symmetries are often described using representations of Lie groups and Lie algebras. For example, the rotation group $SO(3)$ and its representations are crucial in describing the angular momentum of particles.

#### Algebraic Geometry
In algebraic geometry, the action of Lie groups on algebraic varieties and the corresponding representations play a key role in understanding geometric structures.

#### Number Theory
The study of automorphic forms and representations of adelic groups is an important area in modern number theory.

### Key Concepts

#### Weight and Root Systems
In the context of representations, the concepts of weights and roots are fundamental. For a representation of a Lie algebra with a Cartan subalgebra $\mathfrak{h}$, weights are eigenvalues of $\mathfrak{h}$ acting on the representation space. Root systems describe how the Lie algebra decomposes with respect to these weights.

#### Tensor Products
Representations can be combined using tensor products. If $\rho_1: G \to GL(V_1)$ and $\rho_2: G \to GL(V_2)$ are representations of a Lie group $G$, the tensor product representation $\rho_1 \otimes \rho_2$ is defined on the tensor product space $V_1 \otimes V_2$ by
$$ (\rho_1 \otimes \rho_2)(g)(v_1 \otimes v_2) = \rho_1(g)v_1 \otimes \rho_2(g)v_2 \quad \text{for all } g \in G, \, v_1 \in V_1, \, v_2 \in V_2. $$
