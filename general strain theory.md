## General Strain Theory

### Overview

General Strain Theory (GST), developed by Robert Agnew in the 1990s, is an extension of Robert K. Merton's [[Strain Theory]]. While the original strain theory primarily focused on the gap between cultural goals and institutionalized means, GST broadens the scope by considering a variety of stressors or strains that may lead to criminal behavior. GST emphasizes the individual's emotional response to strain and the coping mechanisms they employ.

### Key Concepts

1. **Types of Strain**:
    Agnew identified three major types of strain that can lead to deviant behavior:
    - **Failure to Achieve Positively Valued Goals**: This includes not meeting aspirations or expectations, such as failing to secure a desired job or educational achievement.
    - **Removal of Positively Valued Stimuli**: The loss of something valuable, such as the death of a loved one, breakup of a relationship, or loss of a job.
    - **Presentation of Negative Stimuli**: The presence of negative experiences, such as abuse, bullying, or adverse working conditions.

2. **Emotional Responses**:
    - Strains lead to negative emotional states such as anger, frustration, and depression.
    - These emotions create pressure for corrective action, which can manifest in criminal behavior as a form of coping.

3. **Coping Mechanisms**:
    - **Cognitive Coping**: Reinterpreting the strain in a more positive light, thus reducing its perceived severity.
    - **Behavioral Coping**: Taking action to eliminate the strain or reduce its impact, which can include both legitimate and illegitimate means.
    - **Emotional Coping**: Managing the emotions caused by strain through methods like exercise, relaxation, or substance use.

### Mathematical Formulation

General Strain Theory can be mathematically modeled to understand the probability of deviant behavior. Let:
- $S_i$ represent different types of strain, where $i \in \{1, 2, 3\}$ corresponding to the three types identified by Agnew.
- $E$ represent the emotional response to strain.
- $C$ represent the coping mechanisms available to the individual.

The cumulative strain $S$ can be expressed as:
$$ S = \sum_{i=1}^3 S_i $$

The emotional response $E$ is a function of $S$:
$$ E = f(S) $$
where $f(S)$ is an increasing function, indicating that higher strain leads to stronger negative emotional responses.

The probability of engaging in deviant behavior ($P_D$) is influenced by both the emotional response and the effectiveness of coping mechanisms ($C$):
$$ P_D = g(E, C) $$
where $g(E, C)$ is an increasing function of $E$ and a decreasing function of $C$.

### Empirical Studies and Applications

1. **Empirical Validation**:
    - Studies have found that individuals experiencing multiple forms of strain are more likely to engage in criminal behavior.
    - Research supports that the presence of effective coping mechanisms reduces the likelihood of deviance.

2. **Policy Implications**:
    - **Support Programs**: Providing support for individuals facing significant strain, such as counseling and mental health services, can mitigate negative emotional responses.
    - **Skill Development**: Programs that teach effective coping strategies, such as problem-solving skills and stress management techniques, can reduce the propensity for criminal behavior.
    - **Environmental Changes**: Improving living and working conditions to reduce exposure to negative stimuli can lower overall strain levels in a population.

### Criticisms and Extensions

1. **Criticisms**:
    - GST has been critiqued for its broadness, making it challenging to empirically measure and test all proposed sources of strain and emotional responses.
    - Some argue that the theory still does not fully account for the complexity of motivations behind criminal behavior.

2. **Extensions**:
    - **Integrative Approaches**: Combining GST with other criminological theories, such as social learning theory or control theory, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of criminal behavior.
    - **Focus on Chronic Strain**: Research into chronic versus acute strains and their differential impacts on behavior, considering long-term exposure to adverse conditions.

### Conclusion

General Strain Theory offers a comprehensive framework for understanding how various stressors in life can lead to criminal behavior. By acknowledging the broad range of strains and focusing on the emotional and coping responses, GST provides valuable insights for developing interventions aimed at reducing crime.
