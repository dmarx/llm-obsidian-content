Fermi Liquid Theory


**ASSISTANT**

Fermi liquid theory is a theoretical framework used to describe the low-temperature properties of interacting fermionic systems, such as electrons in metals. Developed by Lev Landau in the 1950s, this theory provides a comprehensive understanding of how strongly interacting fermions can exhibit behavior similar to that of non-interacting particles (or "[[quasi-particles]]"), allowing the complex many-body problem to be simplified.

### Key Concepts

1. **Quasi-Particles**:
   In Fermi liquid theory, the low-energy excitations of an interacting fermion system are described as [[quasi-particles]]. These [[quasi-particles]] have the same quantum numbers as the original fermions but include the effects of interactions. They have a one-to-one correspondence with the excitations of a non-interacting Fermi gas.

2. **Effective Mass**:
   Quasi-particles have an effective mass \( m^* \) that differs from the bare mass \( m \) of the original fermions. This effective mass accounts for the interaction effects:
   $$
   \frac{1}{m^*} = \frac{1}{\hbar^2} \frac{\partial^2 E(k)}{\partial k^2}
   $$
   where \( E(k) \) is the energy of the [[quasi-particles]].

3. **Fermi Surface**:
   The concept of a Fermi surface remains valid in Fermi liquid theory. The Fermi surface is the surface in momentum space that separates occupied from unoccupied quasi-particle states at zero temperature.

4. **Landau Parameters**:
   The interactions between [[quasi-particles]] are characterized by Landau parameters \( F_l \), which are dimensionless coefficients describing the strength and nature of the interactions. These parameters affect various physical properties such as the compressibility, specific heat, and magnetic susceptibility of the Fermi liquid.

### Mathematical Framework

The energy \( E \) of a quasi-particle state in a Fermi liquid can be expressed as:
$$
E = \sum_{\vec{k}} \epsilon_{\vec{k}} n_{\vec{k}} + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{\vec{k}, \vec{k}'} f_{\vec{k}, \vec{k}'} n_{\vec{k}} n_{\vec{k}'}
$$
where:
- \( \epsilon_{\vec{k}} \) is the energy of a quasi-particle with wavevector \( \vec{k} \),
- \( n_{\vec{k}} \) is the occupation number of [[quasi-particles]],
- \( f_{\vec{k}, \vec{k}'} \) is the Landau interaction function describing interactions between [[quasi-particles]].

### Properties of Fermi Liquids

1. **Specific Heat**:
   The specific heat \( C \) of a Fermi liquid at low temperatures is linear in temperature \( T \):
   $$
   C = \gamma T
   $$
   where \( \gamma \) is a constant proportional to the density of states at the Fermi surface. This behavior is similar to that of a non-interacting Fermi gas but modified by the quasi-particle effective mass.

2. **Electrical Conductivity**:
   The electrical conductivity \( \sigma \) in Fermi liquids is influenced by the scattering of [[quasi-particles]]. At low temperatures, the resistivity \( \rho \) typically varies as \( T^2 \), due to electron-electron scattering.

3. **Magnetic Susceptibility**:
   The magnetic susceptibility \( \chi \) of a Fermi liquid is given by:
   $$
   \chi = \frac{\mu_B^2 g(E_F)}{1 + F_0^a}
   $$
   where \( \mu_B \) is the Bohr magneton, \( g(E_F) \) is the density of states at the Fermi level, and \( F_0^a \) is a Landau parameter.

4. **Compressibility**:
   The compressibility \( \kappa \) is related to the Landau parameters and the density of states:
   $$
   \kappa = \frac{g(E_F)}{1 + F_0^s}
   $$
   where \( F_0^s \) is another Landau parameter.

### Example: Liquid Helium-3

Liquid Helium-3 (\(^3\)He) is a classic example of a Fermi liquid. It exhibits behavior that closely matches the predictions of Fermi liquid theory, such as the linear temperature dependence of the specific heat and the \( T^2 \) dependence of the resistivity. The [[quasi-particles]] in liquid \(^3\)He are the Helium-3 atoms themselves, which interact via weak van der Waals forces.

### Comparison with Non-Fermi Liquids

Not all systems of interacting fermions can be described by Fermi liquid theory. Systems that deviate from this behavior are known as non-Fermi liquids. Characteristics of non-Fermi liquids include:
- Absence of well-defined [[quasi-particles]].
- Different temperature dependence of physical properties, such as a specific heat that does not follow a linear temperature dependence.
- Strong correlations and interactions that cannot be captured by a simple quasi-particle picture.

### Conclusion

Fermi liquid theory provides a robust framework for understanding the properties of many strongly interacting fermion systems at low temperatures. By introducing the concept of [[quasi-particles]], it allows complex interactions to be treated in a manner analogous to non-interacting particles, facilitating the calculation and interpretation of various physical properties. Despite its limitations and the existence of non-Fermi liquid behavior in some systems, Fermi liquid theory remains a cornerstone of [[condensed matter physics]].
