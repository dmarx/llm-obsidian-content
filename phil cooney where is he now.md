**USER**

> Phil Cooney resigned from the White House Council on Environmental Quality in 2005 after it was revealed he edited government climate reports. Since then, he has largely stayed out of the public eye.


**ASSISTANT**

### Phil Cooney: Where is He Now?

**Former Role**: Chief of Staff of the White House Council on Environmental Quality; Climate team leader at the American Petroleum Institute (API).

### Background
Phil Cooney gained notoriety when it was revealed that he had edited government climate reports to downplay the scientific consensus on climate change while serving in the Bush administration. Before his government role, Cooney worked as a lobbyist for the American Petroleum Institute, representing the interests of the oil industry.

### Controversy and Resignation
In June 2005, Cooney's edits to climate change reports became public knowledge through investigative journalism by major outlets like The New York Times. These edits were seen as an attempt to cast doubt on the severity and human causes of climate change, aligning with the interests of the fossil fuel industry.

Cooney resigned from his position at the White House Council on Environmental Quality shortly after the revelations, citing personal reasons. His resignation was seen by many as a direct consequence of the scandal.

### Post-Resignation
After leaving the White House, Phil Cooney took a position with ExxonMobil, where he continued to work in a capacity related to public affairs and policy. This move further cemented the perception of his close ties with the fossil fuel industry.

### Current Status
Since his resignation and subsequent employment at ExxonMobil, Cooney has largely stayed out of the public eye. There has been little public information about his activities or roles beyond his initial post-government employment.

### Summary
Phil Cooney's involvement in editing climate reports to downplay the seriousness of climate change was a significant scandal that led to his resignation from the White House Council on Environmental Quality. His move to ExxonMobil after leaving the White House highlighted his continued alignment with the interests of the fossil fuel industry. Since then, Cooney has kept a low profile, and there is limited public information about his recent activities.
