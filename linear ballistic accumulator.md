**ASSISTANT**

The [[Linear Ballistic Accumulator]] (LBA) model is a cognitive model used to describe the process of decision-making, particularly in tasks requiring rapid choices between two or more alternatives. Like the [[Ratcliff Diffusion Model]], the LBA model focuses on how evidence is accumulated over time until a decision threshold is reached. However, the LBA model employs deterministic linear accumulation with stochastic starting points rather than the continuous diffusion process of the RDM.

### Key Components of the LBA Model

1. **Accumulation of Evidence**:
   - In the LBA model, evidence for each option accumulates linearly over time without noise during the accumulation phase.
   - The evidence for each choice \(i\) accumulates at a constant rate \(v_i\), termed the drift rate, until one of the accumulators reaches its threshold.

2. **Drift Rates ( \( v_i \) )**:
   - Each choice has a drift rate \( v_i \) that represents the rate of evidence accumulation for that choice. The drift rates are typically drawn from a normal distribution \( \mathcal{N}(v_i, s_v^2) \), reflecting variability across trials.

3. **Starting Points ( \( k_i \) )**:
   - The starting points of the accumulators \( k_i \) are randomly determined from a uniform distribution \( \mathcal{U}(0, A) \). This randomness accounts for initial biases or variability in the initial evidence for each option.

4. **Thresholds ( \( b \) )**:
   - Each accumulator has a threshold \( b \) that, when reached, triggers a decision. The first accumulator to reach its threshold determines the chosen alternative.
   
5. **Non-Decision Time ( \( T_{er} \) )**:
   - Similar to the RDM, the LBA model includes a non-decision time \( T_{er} \) to account for processes like stimulus encoding and response execution. The observed response time \( RT \) is the sum of the decision time (time taken for the first accumulator to reach its threshold) and the non-decision time.

### Mathematical Formalism

1. **Deterministic Evidence Accumulation**:
   - For each option \( i \), the evidence \( E_i(t) \) at time \( t \) is given by:
     $$ E_i(t) = k_i + v_i t $$
     where \( k_i \) is the initial evidence (starting point) and \( v_i \) is the drift rate.

2. **Decision Time**:
   - The decision time for an accumulator \( i \) to reach its threshold \( b \) is:
     $$ T_i = \frac{b - k_i}{v_i} $$
   - The decision is made by the first accumulator to reach its threshold:
     $$ T_{dec} = \min(T_1, T_2, \ldots, T_n) $$
   - The response time \( RT \) is then:
     $$ RT = T_{dec} + T_{er} $$

3. **Probability Density Function (PDF) for Decision Times**:
   - The PDF for the decision time of a particular choice is derived from the distributions of the starting points and drift rates. The exact form involves integrating over the distributions of these parameters and is typically computed numerically.

### Practical Applications

The LBA model is particularly useful for analyzing response time and accuracy in multi-alternative decision tasks. It provides a more straightforward and computationally efficient alternative to diffusion models, especially for complex or high-dimensional decision scenarios.

### Parameter Estimation

Parameter estimation in the LBA model involves fitting the model to observed data, often using techniques such as:
- Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)
- Bayesian inference
- Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for hierarchical modeling

### Conclusion

The [[Linear Ballistic Accumulator]] model offers a simplified yet powerful framework for understanding decision-making processes. By modeling evidence accumulation as a linear, deterministic process with random starting points, the LBA model provides clear and interpretable parameters that describe both the speed and accuracy of decisions. Its computational efficiency and robustness make it a valuable tool in cognitive psychology and related fields.
