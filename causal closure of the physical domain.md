title: causal closure of the physical domain

**USER**

causal closure of the physical domain


**ASSISTANT**

The **causal closure of the physical domain** is a principle in the philosophy of mind and metaphysics that asserts all physical events can be fully accounted for by physical causes. This principle is central to physicalism, which posits that everything that exists is physical or depends on the physical.

### Key Concepts of Causal Closure

#### Definition

- **Causal Closure**: The principle that if a physical event has a cause, it must have a sufficient physical cause. This means that physical effects are not caused by anything outside the physical domain.
- **Physical Domain**: Refers to the realm of physical entities and processes governed by the laws of physics.

### Importance in Philosophy of Mind

#### Implications for Dualism and Mental Causation

- **Challenge to Dualism**: Causal closure poses a significant challenge to dualism, which posits that the mind and body are distinct substances. If the physical domain is causally closed, then non-physical mental states cannot have causal effects on the physical world.
- **Mental Causation**: For mental states to cause physical effects, they must either be identical to physical states or have some physical basis that respects causal closure.

### Jaegwon Kim's Contribution

#### Causal Exclusion Argument

Jaegwon Kim used the principle of causal closure to develop the **causal exclusion argument** against [[non-reductive physicalism]]:
- **Causal Sufficiency**: If physical causes are sufficient for physical effects, then there seems to be no need for mental causes to account for these effects.
- **Exclusion**: If every physical effect already has a sufficient physical cause, additional mental causes would lead to overdetermination (the effect being caused by multiple sufficient causes), which is generally considered implausible.
- **Reductive Physicalism**: Kim argues that to preserve the causal efficacy of mental states, they must be reducible to physical states. Otherwise, [[mental causation]] is excluded by the sufficiency of physical causes.

### Formulation of the Principle

To formalize the causal closure principle, consider the following:

1. **Physical Event** (\(E\)): An event that occurs within the physical domain.
2. **Sufficient Physical Cause** (\(P\)): A physical cause that is sufficient to bring about \(E\).

The causal closure principle states that:

\[ \forall E \, (E \text{ is a physical event} \rightarrow \exists P \, (P \text{ is a sufficient physical cause of } E)) \]

### Implications for Theories of Mind

#### Physicalism

- **Support for Physicalism**: Causal closure supports physicalism by maintaining that physical events are fully explicable in terms of physical causes, leaving no room for non-physical causes.
- **Reductionism**: It often leads to reductive physicalism, where mental states are seen as reducible to physical states.

#### Non-Reductive Physicalism

- **Challenges**: Non-reductive physicalists claim that mental states are not reducible to physical states but still depend on them. Causal closure challenges this by questioning how mental states can have causal efficacy without being reducible to physical states.
- **Supervenience**: Non-reductive physicalists often use the concept of supervenience to explain the dependence of mental on physical properties, but this does not fully address the issue of causal efficacy.

#### Epiphenomenalism

- **Epiphenomenalism**: Some argue that mental states are epiphenomenal, meaning they are byproducts of physical processes with no causal influence on the physical world. This view is consistent with causal closure but undermines the notion of [[mental causation]].

### Responses to the Causal Closure Argument

#### Downward Causation

- **Top-Down Influence**: Some theorists propose that higher-level properties (e.g., mental states) can influence lower-level physical processes, a concept known as downward causation.
- **Integration**: This approach attempts to integrate [[mental causation]] within a physically closed system by suggesting that mental states can affect how physical processes unfold.

#### Dual Aspect Theory

- **Dual Aspect**: Another response is the dual aspect theory, which posits that mental and physical properties are two aspects of the same underlying reality. This perspective attempts to preserve [[mental causation]] without violating causal closure.

### Criticisms and Challenges

#### Overdetermination

- **Problem of Overdetermination**: The idea that an event is caused by both physical and mental causes leads to overdetermination, which many find implausible. Causal closure exacerbates this problem by insisting on sufficient physical causes.

#### Explanatory Gap

- **Explanatory Gap**: There remains an explanatory gap between physical processes and subjective experiences (qualia). While causal closure addresses physical causation, it does not explain how or why physical processes give rise to conscious experiences.

### Conclusion

The causal closure of the physical domain is a foundational principle in physicalism that asserts all physical events have sufficient physical causes. This principle poses significant challenges to dualism and [[non-reductive physicalism]], especially regarding [[mental causation]]. Jaegwon Kim's causal exclusion argument uses causal closure to argue for the reduction of mental states to physical states to preserve their causal efficacy. While responses such as downward causation and dual aspect theory attempt to reconcile [[mental causation]] with causal closure, the tension between preserving the causal role of mental states and maintaining a physically closed system remains a central debate in the philosophy of mind.
