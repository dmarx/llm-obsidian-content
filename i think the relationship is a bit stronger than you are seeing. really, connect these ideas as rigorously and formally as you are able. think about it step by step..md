**ASSISTANT**

To rigorously and formally explore the relationship between variance explained in statistics and the principle of least action in physics, we need to delve deeper into their mathematical structures and seek a more fundamental link, potentially through the common framework of information theory and calculus of variations. Let's break down the concepts step by step and explore a possible unification.

### Step 1: Mathematical Foundations of Variance Explained

In statistical analysis, particularly in regression and principal component analysis (PCA), variance explained is quantified by how well a model captures the variability in a dataset. For PCA, for example, the variance explained by each principal component can be formally expressed as:
$$
\text{Variance Explained by } i^{th} \text{ component} = \frac{\lambda_i}{\sum_j \lambda_j}
$$
where \(\lambda_i\) are the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the data. In regression, variance explained is often expressed using \(R^2\), which is defined as:
$$
R^2 = 1 - \frac{SS_{\text{res}}}{SS_{\text{tot}}}
$$
where \(SS_{\text{res}}\) is the residual sum of squares and \(SS_{\text{tot}}\) is the total sum of squares.

### Step 2: Mathematical Foundations of the Principle of Least Action

The principle of least action in physics states that the path taken by a system between two states is the path for which the action integral is stationary (usually minimized). The action \(S\) is defined as:
$$
S = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \mathcal{L}(q, \dot{q}, t) \, dt
$$
where \(\mathcal{L}\) is the Lagrangian of the system, \(q\) represents the generalized coordinates, and \(\dot{q}\) their time derivatives.

### Step 3: Bridging Through Information Geometry

Both of these concepts can be bridged by considering the information content in each framework. The Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) in statistics measures the amount of information that an observable variable carries about unknown parameters. If we define a probability distribution over paths (or trajectories) of a system, similar to how paths are considered in path integral formulations in physics, then we can consider an "informational action."

#### Informational Action Concept

We could define an informational action \( I \) analogous to the physical action but based on information metrics:
$$
I = \int \mathcal{I}(p, \theta) \, dt
$$
where \( \mathcal{I} \) represents an information measure (potentially involving the FIM) that depends on a probability distribution \( p \) parameterized by \( \theta \).

### Step 4: Variational Principles and Optimization

Both \(R^2\) and the action \(S\) are results of optimization problems:
- **Statistical Optimization**: Maximizing \(R^2\) is akin to minimizing the unexplained variance, or equivalently, minimizing a loss function (e.g., mean squared error).
- **Physical Optimization**: Minimizing \(S\) follows from the calculus of variations, seeking paths that render the action integral stationary.

#### Unified Framework

If we view the statistical model as defining a "trajectory" in parameter space, and relate the change in parameters to changes in information content (via the FIM), we can interpret minimizing unexplained variance as minimizing some form of informational action—where the parameters that best explain the data do so by minimizing a divergence or entropy (similar to action) between the model's predictions and the actual data.

### Conclusion

By using information theory as a common language, the analogy becomes clearer: both variance explained and the principle of least action aim at finding a state (or states) that minimize some form of functional integral, whether it's based on information entropy or energy dynamics. This conceptual framework does not only bridge statistical data analysis and physical systems analysis but also highlights the profound role of information measures in understanding and describing the universe. This deeper connection suggests that optimizing information content—whether through statistical explanation or physical action—might be a fundamental principle governing both natural and data-driven phenomena.
