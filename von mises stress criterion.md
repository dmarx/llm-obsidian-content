# von Mises Stress Criterion

## Definition

The von Mises stress criterion, also known as the maximum distortion energy criterion, is a yield criterion used in engineering to predict the onset of plastic deformation in ductile materials. It is based on the concept that yielding occurs when the distortional energy in the material reaches a critical value, independent of the hydrostatic stress component.

## Mathematical Formulation

The von Mises stress \( \sigma_v \) is defined as:

$$
\sigma_v = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2

# von Mises Stress Criterion

## Definition

The von Mises stress criterion, also known as the maximum distortion energy criterion, is a yield criterion used to predict the onset of plastic deformation in ductile materials. It is based on the concept that yielding begins when the distortion energy per unit volume reaches a critical value. This criterion is particularly useful because it provides a single scalar value for stress that can be compared directly to the material's yield strength.

## Mathematical Formulation

The von Mises stress \( \sigma_v \) is calculated from the principal stresses \( \sigma_1 \), \( \sigma_2 \), and \( \sigma_3 \) using the following formula:

$$
\sigma_v = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \left[ (\sigma_1 - \sigma_2)^2 + (\sigma_2 - \sigma_3)^2 + (\sigma_3 - \sigma_1)^2 \right]}
$$

In terms of the stress tensor components, the von Mises stress can be expressed as:

$$
\sigma_v = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \left[ (\sigma_{xx} - \sigma_{yy})^2 + (\sigma_{yy} - \sigma_{zz})^2 + (\sigma_{zz} - \sigma_{xx})^2 + 6 (\tau_{xy}^2 + \tau_{yz}^2 + \tau_{zx}^2) \right]}
$$

where:
- \( \sigma_{xx} \), \( \sigma_{yy} \), \( \sigma_{zz} \) are the normal stresses.
- \( \tau_{xy} \), \( \tau_{yz} \), \( \tau_{zx} \) are the shear stresses.

## Yield Condition

According to the von Mises criterion, yielding occurs when the von Mises stress reaches the yield strength \( \sigma_y \) of the material:

$$
\sigma_v = \sigma_y
$$

This criterion implies that yielding is independent of the hydrostatic component of the stress state, as it only depends on the deviatoric (distortional) stress.

## Interpretation and Physical Meaning

The von Mises stress is a measure of the energy stored in a material due to distortion. It is derived from the theory that plastic deformation begins when the distortion energy reaches a critical value. This energy-based approach is particularly suitable for ductile materials, which can undergo significant plastic deformation before failure.

## Applications

### Material Testing

The von Mises stress criterion is widely used in material testing to determine the yield strength of ductile materials. It provides a clear and consistent way to compare experimental results with theoretical predictions.

### Finite Element Analysis (FEA)

In FEA, the von Mises stress is commonly used to evaluate the structural integrity of components under complex loading conditions. It allows engineers to predict where yielding will occur and to design structures that avoid plastic deformation under operational loads.

### Design and Safety

The von Mises stress criterion is integral to design codes and safety standards for engineering structures. By ensuring that the von Mises stress remains below the yield strength of the material, engineers can design safe and reliable components.

## Comparison with Other Yield Criteria

### Tresca Criterion

The Tresca criterion, or maximum shear stress criterion, states that yielding occurs when the maximum shear stress reaches a critical value. It is given by:

$$
\tau_{\text{max}} = \frac{1}{2} (\sigma_1 - \sigma_3) = \frac{\sigma_y}{2}
$$

The von Mises criterion is generally considered to be more accurate than the Tresca criterion for predicting yielding in ductile materials because it provides a closer approximation to experimental results.

### Mohr-Coulomb Criterion

The Mohr-Coulomb criterion is primarily used for brittle materials and soils. It considers both the normal and shear stresses on the failure plane. The von Mises criterion is more suitable for ductile metals where distortion energy is a better predictor of yielding.

## Example Calculation

Consider a state of stress with the following components:
- \( \sigma_{xx} = 100 \, \text{MPa} \)
- \( \sigma_{yy} = 50 \, \text{MPa} \)
- \( \sigma_{zz} = -25 \, \text{MPa} \)
- \( \tau_{xy} = 30 \, \text{MPa} \)
- \( \tau_{yz} = 20 \, \text{MPa} \)
- \( \tau_{zx} = 10 \, \text{MPa} \)

The von Mises stress is calculated as:

$$
\sigma_v = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \left[ (100 - 50)^2 + (50 + 25)^2 + (-25 - 100)^2 + 6 (30^2 + 20^2 + 10^2) \right]}
$$

$$
\sigma_v = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \left[ 2500 + 5625 + 15625 + 6 (900 + 400 + 100) \right]}
$$

$$
\sigma_v = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \left[ 2500 + 5625 + 15625 + 8400 \right]}
$$

$$
\sigma_v = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \left[ 32150 \right]}
$$

$$
\sigma_v = \sqrt{16075} \approx 126.76 \, \text{MPa}
$$

If the yield strength \( \sigma_y \) of the material is 120 MPa, then:

$$
\sigma_v = 126.76 \, \text{MPa} > \sigma_y = 120 \, \text{MPa}
$$

This indicates that yielding will occur under the given stress state.

## Summary

The von Mises stress criterion is a fundamental tool in predicting the yielding of ductile materials. By providing a scalar value for the equivalent stress, it simplifies the analysis of complex stress states and aids in the design and evaluation of engineering components.

Johnson's elastic-plastic contact model

# Johnson's Elastic-Plastic Contact Model

## Definition

Johnson's elastic-plastic contact model refines Hertzian contact theory to account for both elastic and plastic deformations that occur when two bodies come into contact. It is particularly useful for analyzing contact situations where the applied load is high enough to cause plastic deformation at the contact interface, but the overall deformation is still predominantly elastic.

## Key Concepts

### Elastic-Plastic Transition

In the contact between two bodies, deformation initially follows Hertzian elastic contact theory. As the load increases, the contact pressure may exceed the material's yield strength, leading to plastic deformation. Johnson's model describes this transition and provides a more accurate depiction of the [[contact mechanics]] by incorporating plasticity effects.

### Yielding and Hardness

The onset of plastic deformation is typically determined using the von Mises yield criterion. The hardness \( H \) of the material is often used to characterize its resistance to plastic deformation. For many materials, hardness is approximately three times the yield strength (\( H \approx 3\sigma_y \)).

## Mathematical Formulation

### Elastic Contact Radius (Hertzian)

For two spherical bodies in elastic contact, the contact radius \( a \) according to Hertzian theory is:

$$
a = \left( \frac{3 F R'}{4 E^*} \right)^{1/3}
$$

where:
- \( F \) is the normal load.
- \( R' \) is the reduced radius of curvature, defined as \( \frac{1}{R'} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} \).
- \( E^* \) is the effective modulus of elasticity, defined as \( \frac{1}{E^*} = \frac{1-\nu_1^2}{E_1} + \frac{1-\nu_2^2}{E_2} \).

### Johnson's Model

Johnson's model modifies the Hertzian contact radius to account for plastic deformation. The contact radius \( a \) in the elastic-plastic regime is given by:

$$
a = \left( \frac{3 F R'}{4 E^*} \right)^{1/3} \left[ 1 + \left( \frac{3 F}{4 H a^2} \right)^{2/3} \right]
$$

This equation introduces a correction term that accounts for the plastic deformation occurring at the contact interface.

### Total Deformation

The total deformation \( \delta \) of the contacting bodies, considering both elastic and plastic components, can be expressed as:

$$
\delta = \frac{a^2}{R} + \frac{a}{H}
$$

where:
- The first term \( \frac{a^2}{R} \) represents the elastic deformation.
- The second term \( \frac{a}{H} \) represents the plastic deformation.

## Application of Johnson's Model

### Contact Pressure Distribution

In Johnson's model, the pressure distribution within the contact area is not purely parabolic as in Hertzian theory due to the contribution of plastic deformation. The maximum contact pressure \( p_0 \) can be approximated by considering the yield strength and hardness of the material.

### Load-Carrying Capacity

Johnson's model provides a more accurate prediction of the load-carrying capacity of the contact interface, especially under high loads where plastic deformation is significant. This is critical in applications such as bearings, gears, and other mechanical components subjected to high stresses.

## Example Calculation

Consider a spherical indenter of radius \( R \) in contact with a flat surface. The material properties are given as:
- Yield strength \( \sigma_y \)
- Hardness \( H \approx 3\sigma_y \)
- Modulus of elasticity \( E \)
- Poisson's ratio \( \nu \)

For a given normal load \( F \), the elastic contact radius \( a_{elastic} \) is:

$$
a_{elastic} = \left( \frac{3 F R}{4 E^*} \right)^{1/3}
$$

To find the elastic-plastic contact radius \( a \), we use Johnson's correction term:

1. Calculate \( a_{elastic} \):

$$
a_{elastic} = \left( \frac{3 F R}{4 E^*} \right)^{1/3}
$$

2. Apply Johnson's correction:

$$
a = a_{elastic} \left[ 1 + \left( \frac{3 F}{4 H a_{elastic}^2} \right)^{2/3} \right]
$$

Iteratively solve for \( a \), if necessary, since the correction term depends on \( a_{elastic} \).

### Example Parameters

Assume:
- \( F = 1000 \, \text{N} \)
- \( R = 10 \, \text{mm} \)
- \( E = 210 \, \text{GPa} \)
- \( \nu = 0.3 \)
- \( \sigma_y = 250 \, \text{MPa} \)
- \( H = 3 \sigma_y = 750 \, \text{MPa} \)

Effective modulus of elasticity \( E^* \):

$$
E^* = \frac{E}{2 (1 - \nu^2)} = \frac{210}{2 (1 - 0.3^2)} = 115.38 \, \text{GPa}
$$

Elastic contact radius \( a_{elastic} \):

$$
a_{elastic} = \left( \frac{3 \times 1000 \times 0.01}{4 \times 115.38 \times 10^9} \right)^{1/3} \approx 0.028 \, \text{mm}
$$

Johnson's correction term:

$$
a = 0.028 \left[ 1 + \left( \frac{3 \times 1000}{4 \times 750 \times (0.028)^2} \right)^{2/3} \right]
$$

Calculate iteratively, if necessary, to refine \( a \).

## Summary

Johnson's elastic-plastic contact model provides a more comprehensive understanding of the [[contact mechanics]] between two bodies by incorporating both elastic and plastic deformation effects. This model is essential for accurately predicting the behavior of materials and components under high loads, ensuring better design and reliability in engineering applications.
