## Environment Building in Improv

### Definition

**Environment building** in improv refers to the creation and establishment of a believable setting or atmosphere within a scene through the use of imaginary objects, physical actions, and interactions between performers. This technique is essential for immersing the audience in the world of the scene and providing a clear context for the characters and their actions.

### Key Concepts

1. **Physical Space**:
    - Establishing the physical layout of the environment, including walls, furniture, and objects, helps ground the scene in a specific location.
    - Example: Defining the placement of a door, a table, and chairs in an imaginary living room allows performers to interact consistently with the space.

2. **Spatial Relationships**:
    - Understanding and maintaining spatial relationships between objects and characters is crucial for continuity and believability.
    - Example: If one performer places an imaginary chair at a specific spot, other performers should recognize and respect that location.

3. **Sensory Details**:
    - Including sensory details like sounds, smells, and textures can enhance the environment's realism and depth.
    - Example: Mimicking the sound of a creaky floorboard or describing the aroma of freshly baked bread can enrich the audience's experience.

4. **Consistency and Memory**:
    - Consistency in the use of imaginary objects and the environment is vital. Performers must remember and adhere to the established details throughout the scene.
    - Example: If a performer "opens" a cabinet to take out an item, they should remember to "close" it afterward.

### Techniques and Exercises

1. **Walk the Space**:
    - Performers walk through an imagined environment, defining and interacting with objects and structures as they move.
    - Exercise: Walk through an imaginary kitchen, opening cabinets, using appliances, and setting the table, building the environment through detailed actions.

2. **Environment Mapping**:
    - Performers collectively create a map of the environment through their actions, establishing and agreeing on the layout and objects.
    - Exercise: In a group, each performer adds to the environment by introducing new objects or areas, ensuring everyone acknowledges and incorporates these additions.

3. **Sensory Exploration**:
    - Focus on incorporating sensory details into the environment to make it more vivid and immersive.
    - Exercise: Perform a scene where characters describe and react to sensory details like temperature, smells, and sounds, enhancing the environment's richness.

4. **Spatial Memory Games**:
    - Practice exercises that challenge performers to remember and interact with established spatial details.
    - Exercise: Create a complex environment and periodically quiz performers on the location of objects or the layout to reinforce spatial memory.

### Practical Application in Improv Scenes

1. **Scene Setting**:
    - Environment building can quickly establish the context and location of a scene without the need for extensive dialogue.
    - Example: A performer miming setting up a campsite, lighting a fire, and pitching a tent immediately conveys an outdoor wilderness setting.

2. **Character Interaction**:
    - The environment influences and is influenced by character actions and interactions. Characters' relationships with the space can reveal aspects of their personalities and dynamics.
    - Example: A meticulous character might precisely arrange objects on a desk, while a chaotic character might haphazardly throw things around.

3. **Plot Development**:
    - The environment can play a critical role in the narrative, creating opportunities and obstacles for characters.
    - Example: A hidden trapdoor in a haunted house can become a pivotal plot point, driving the story forward.

### Examples from Improv Shows

- **The Groundlings**: This improv group frequently uses detailed environment building to create rich, immersive scenes that support character-driven narratives.
- **Second City**: Known for their sketch and improv performances, Second City often employs environment building to set up elaborate scenes that enhance the comedic and dramatic elements of their shows.

### Summary

Environment building is a vital technique in improv that involves creating a believable and immersive setting through imaginary objects, physical actions, and interactions. By focusing on physical space, spatial relationships, sensory details, and consistency, performers can ground their scenes in a tangible context, enhancing the audience's engagement and the narrative's depth. Exercises and practice in spatial awareness, sensory exploration, and memory help performers master this essential skill, contributing to more compelling and dynamic improv performances.
