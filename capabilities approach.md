Capabilities Approach


**ASSISTANT**

The **Capabilities Approach** is a theoretical framework that emphasizes the actual abilities and opportunities individuals have to achieve various valuable states of being and activities. This approach was pioneered by economist [[Amartya Sen|Sen]] and further developed by philosopher [[Martha Nussbaum|Nussbaum]]. Unlike traditional welfare economics, which focuses on income or utility, the capabilities approach focuses on what people are actually able to do and to be—their "capabilities."

### Key Concepts

1. **Capabilities:**
   - **Definition:** Capabilities are the various combinations of functionings (beings and doings) that a person can achieve. They represent the real freedoms or opportunities to achieve well-being.
   - **Example:** The capability to be healthy includes access to medical care, nutrition, clean water, and the ability to lead a healthy lifestyle.

2. **Functionings:**
   - **Definition:** Functionings are the various states of being and activities that make up a person's life, such as being healthy, being educated, or participating in community activities.
   - **Example:** Functionings include being well-nourished, having a good job, or being able to travel freely.

3. **Agency:**
   - **Definition:** Agency refers to a person’s ability to pursue goals they value and have reason to value. It involves having the freedom to make choices about one's own life.
   - **Example:** Agency includes the ability to participate in political processes, make decisions about one’s own health, or choose one's career path.

### Theoretical Foundations

1. **Amartya Sen's Contribution:**
   - Sen introduced the capabilities approach as a way to evaluate social arrangements, the standard of living, and individual well-being.
   - He emphasized the importance of removing "unfreedoms" such as poverty, lack of access to healthcare and education, and social discrimination.
   - **Mathematical Formalism:** Let $C_i$ represent the set of capabilities available to individual $i$. The objective is to expand this set:
     $$
     \max \, C_i
     $$
     This maximization should consider the range and quality of capabilities.

2. **Martha Nussbaum's Contribution:**
   - Nussbaum expanded the approach by proposing a list of central human capabilities, which she argues are essential for a dignified human life.
   - **Central Capabilities:**
     1. **Life:** Being able to live a full life.
     2. **Bodily Health:** Having good health, including reproductive health.
     3. **Bodily Integrity:** Being able to move freely and be secure from violence.
     4. **Senses, Imagination, and Thought:** Being able to use senses, imagine, think, and reason.
     5. **Emotions:** Having attachments to things and people outside oneself.
     6. **Practical Reason:** Being able to form a conception of the good and engage in critical reflection.
     7. **Affiliation:** Being able to live with and toward others, recognize and show concern for others.
     8. **Other Species:** Being able to live with concern for and in relation to animals, plants, and the world of nature.
     9. **Play:** Being able to laugh, play, and enjoy recreational activities.
     10. **Control over One's Environment:** Political and material control over one's environment.
   - **Mathematical Formalism:** Nussbaum suggests a normative list of capabilities, $N = \{N_1, N_2, \ldots, N_{10}\}$, each representing an essential domain of human functioning.

### Practical Applications

1. **Development Policy:**
   - Policies should aim to expand people's capabilities, not just increase economic growth.
   - **Example:** Implementing programs that provide education, healthcare, and social services to enhance individuals' capabilities.

2. **Social Justice:**
   - Justice should be evaluated based on how well societies provide capabilities to their members.
   - **Example:** Assessing the fairness of a society by examining whether marginalized groups have the capabilities to achieve their potential.

3. **Gender Equality:**
   - The capabilities approach highlights the importance of gender-specific interventions to ensure that women have the same capabilities as men.
   - **Example:** Programs that address women's health, education, and economic opportunities.

### Comparison with Other Approaches

1. **Utilitarianism:**
   - **Focus:** Maximizing overall happiness or utility.
   - **Capabilities Approach:** Focuses on individual freedoms and opportunities rather than aggregate happiness.

2. **Resource-Based Approaches:**
   - **Focus:** Equal distribution of resources.
   - **Capabilities Approach:** Emphasizes what people can actually do with the resources they have, considering personal and contextual factors.

3. **Rights-Based Approaches:**
   - **Focus:** Ensuring individual rights.
   - **Capabilities Approach:** While aligned with protecting rights, it goes further to ensure individuals have the real freedom to exercise those rights.

### Criticisms and Challenges

1. **Operationalization:**
   - Critics argue that measuring capabilities is complex and subjective.
   - Response: Development of indices and surveys to assess capabilities directly, such as the Human Development Index (HDI).

2. **Cultural Relativism:**
   - The universal list of capabilities may not respect cultural differences.
   - Response: While Nussbaum advocates for a universal list, Sen emphasizes context-specific capabilities.

### Conclusion

The capabilities approach provides a comprehensive framework for assessing and promoting human well-being, focusing on what individuals are able to do and to be. It has significant implications for public policy, [[social justice]], and international development. For more in-depth exploration, one can delve into works by [[Amartya Sen|Sen]] and [[Martha Nussbaum|Nussbaum]], and examine applications in areas like [[Development Economics|development economics]] and [[Human Rights|human rights]].
