### Triangulation

Triangulation is a method used in various scientific and technical fields to determine the location of a point by forming triangles to it from known points. It is widely used in surveying, navigation, and geophysics.

#### Principles of Triangulation

1. **Basic Geometry**: Triangulation relies on the properties of triangles. Given a triangle with one known side (baseline) and the angles at either end, the remaining sides and the location of the point can be determined.
2. **Law of Sines**: This law relates the lengths of sides of a triangle to the sines of its angles:
   $$\frac{a}{\sin(A)} = \frac{b}{\sin(B)} = \frac{c}{\sin(C)}$$
   where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the sides of the triangle, and $A$, $B$, and $C$ are the respective opposite angles.

#### Mathematical Formulation

Assume we have a baseline between two points $A$ and $B$ with a known distance $d$. We need to determine the location of point $C$ by measuring the angles $\alpha$ and $\beta$ from $A$ and $B$ respectively to $C$.

1. **Forming the Triangles**:
   - Point $A$ at $(0, 0)$.
   - Point $B$ at $(d, 0)$.
   - Point $C$ at $(x, y)$, which is unknown.

2. **Using Trigonometry**:
   - From point $A$, the coordinates of $C$ can be expressed as:
     $$ x = d \cos(\alpha) + d \cos(\beta) $$
     $$ y = d \sin(\alpha) + d \sin(\beta) $$

3. **System of Equations**:
   Given the two angles $\alpha$ and $\beta$ and the distance $d$, we can set up a system of equations to solve for $(x, y)$:
   $$ \tan(\alpha) = \frac{y}{x} $$
   $$ \tan(\beta) = \frac{y}{d - x} $$

4. **Solving for Coordinates**:
   Rearranging the equations and solving for $x$ and $y$ gives us the coordinates of point $C$.

#### Applications of Triangulation

- **Surveying**: In land surveying, triangulation is used to measure large distances by dividing the area into a network of triangles. Each vertex of a triangle is a surveyed point, and the process continues until the entire area is mapped.
- **Navigation**: In marine and aerial navigation, triangulation is used to determine the position of a vessel or aircraft by taking bearings from two known locations.
- **Geophysics**: In earthquake seismology, triangulation helps determine the epicenter of an earthquake by measuring the arrival times of seismic waves at different stations.

#### Example: Triangulation in Surveying

1. **Establish Baseline**: A baseline of known length $AB$ is measured.
2. **Measure Angles**: Angles $\alpha$ and $\beta$ to the unknown point $C$ are measured from $A$ and $B$ respectively.
3. **Compute Distance**: Using the law of sines, the distances from $A$ and $B$ to $C$ can be computed:
   $$ AC = \frac{d \sin(\beta)}{\sin(\alpha + \beta)} $$
   $$ BC = \frac{d \sin(\alpha)}{\sin(\alpha + \beta)} $$

By applying these principles, triangulation provides a robust method for determining unknown positions and mapping areas with high precision.
