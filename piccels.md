**USER**

> PICCELS


**ASSISTANT**

**PICCELS** is an expanded mnemonic that builds on the **MICE** (Money, Ideology, Coercion, Ego) model to describe the range of psychological motivations that intelligence officers might use to recruit assets or sources. Each letter in PICCELS represents a different motivational factor, providing intelligence professionals with a broader and more nuanced set of tools for assessing potential recruits. By understanding these motivations, intelligence officers can identify individuals likely to cooperate, exploit vulnerabilities, and maintain productive, reliable relationships with assets.

Here’s a breakdown of each component in the **PICCELS** model:

---

### **P: Power**
   - **Description**: Some individuals are driven by a desire for influence or authority. They may seek to wield control over others, affect outcomes, or enhance their status within an organization or society.
   - **Characteristics**: Power-driven individuals often occupy influential roles or aspire to them. They may be ambitious, politically minded, or highly competitive.
   - **Recruitment Techniques**: Intelligence officers might appeal to a recruit’s desire for influence by offering them access to sensitive information, opportunities to affect decisions, or roles that allow them to exercise control. Power-driven assets may respond well to promises of control over specific outcomes or influence within their organization.

### **I: Ideology**
   - **Description**: Ideologically motivated individuals are often committed to a specific set of beliefs, values, or causes. They may feel loyalty to a particular nation, political system, religious ideology, or social movement.
   - **Characteristics**: Ideologically motivated recruits are often principled, passionate, and loyal to their beliefs. They may be willing to take risks or sacrifice personal gain to support their ideological alignment.
   - **Recruitment Techniques**: Intelligence officers establish rapport by emphasizing shared beliefs and values, positioning the recruitment as a way to advance a common cause. For example, a recruit disillusioned with their government might be persuaded to work for an organization aligned with their ideals.

### **C: Conscience**
   - **Description**: Conscience-driven individuals may act out of a moral or ethical imperative to expose wrongdoing, right a perceived injustice, or reveal corruption. These individuals are often self-driven to “do the right thing,” and may see their cooperation as a form of whistleblowing or ethical duty.
   - **Characteristics**: They are typically guided by strong ethical principles and are motivated by perceived injustices. Conscience-driven individuals are often idealistic and may express regret or frustration at perceived moral failings around them.
   - **Recruitment Techniques**: Intelligence officers may approach such recruits by framing their cooperation as a moral obligation, offering them a sense of duty or justice. Emphasizing the opportunity to protect others or expose wrongdoing can be powerful motivators.

### **C: Coercion (or Compromise)**
   - **Description**: Coercion involves compelling an individual to cooperate by using force, threats, or exploiting vulnerabilities such as personal secrets, criminal behavior, or other forms of compromise.
   - **Characteristics**: Coerced assets may exhibit anxiety, reluctance, or resentment, as they are often forced into cooperation. They may have compromised backgrounds or unresolved issues that make them vulnerable to pressure.
   - **Recruitment Techniques**: Intelligence officers identify and leverage a person’s vulnerabilities, using threats of exposure, blackmail, or psychological pressure. Although effective, coercion can produce unreliable assets and carries the risk of resentment, so it’s often used sparingly.

### **E: Ego**
   - **Description**: Ego-driven individuals seek validation, recognition, or esteem. They may desire attention, recognition of their talents, or a sense of superiority over others.
   - **Characteristics**: Individuals with strong egos may exhibit narcissism, overconfidence, or a need for admiration. They may feel undervalued in their current roles and crave the opportunity to “prove” themselves or outwit others.
   - **Recruitment Techniques**: Intelligence officers may appeal to an ego-driven individual’s sense of self-importance, offering special treatment, unique responsibilities, or exclusive information. Recognizing their perceived superiority can foster a sense of pride in cooperation.

### **L: Lust**
   - **Description**: Lust motivations involve sexual or romantic entanglements that can be used as leverage, whether through attraction, relationships, or other intimate vulnerabilities. This motivation is less common but can be highly effective in certain circumstances.
   - **Characteristics**: Individuals motivated by lust may engage in risky behavior, secret relationships, or extramarital affairs that make them vulnerable to compromise or manipulation.
   - **Recruitment Techniques**: Intelligence officers might exploit romantic or sexual relationships to influence an individual’s decisions. This could involve direct use of “honey traps” (using a romantic or sexual interest to gather information) or exploiting existing relationships as leverage.

### **S: Social/Status (Injustice)**
   - **Description**: Individuals motivated by social factors or a sense of *injustice* often seek to redress grievances related to perceived inequity, mistreatment, or lack of recognition. Status-motivated individuals may desire higher social standing, respect, or revenge against perceived injustices.
   - **Characteristics**: Social/status-motivated recruits might feel overlooked, unfairly treated, or resentful toward superiors. They may also desire status elevation, often seeking a position or influence within a group or organization.
   - **Recruitment Techniques**: Officers might leverage resentment by appealing to the recruit’s grievances, framing cooperation as an opportunity to “right a wrong” or enhance their status. This could involve emphasizing the recruit’s unique skills or opportunities to surpass competitors.

### Using PICCELS in Intelligence Operations

The **PICCELS** framework offers a more comprehensive tool for understanding complex and multifaceted motivations that drive human behavior. Here's how it’s typically applied:

1. **Enhanced Target Profiling**: With a deeper pool of motivations, officers can build a more complete psychological profile of potential assets, identifying combinations of motivators that might interact (e.g., power and ego, conscience and ideology).
   
2. **Tailored Approaches**: PICCELS allows for a more nuanced approach to recruitment and asset management. If a recruit is motivated by both ego and conscience, an officer might emphasize their unique role in “making a difference” while praising their insights.
   
3. **Improved Asset Reliability**: Understanding the primary motivator(s) for an asset helps maintain cooperation and reduces the risk of defection or betrayal. If a conscience-driven asset starts to feel they’re betraying their values, handlers can reemphasize the ethical dimension of their work to realign motivations.

4. **Risk Mitigation**: Each motivation carries its own risks. For instance, coercion and compromise are high-risk motivators because they can breed resentment, while ego-driven assets may demand more attention or become difficult to manage. Knowing these risks allows handlers to adjust their strategies.

### PICCELS in Practice: Motivational Layering

Often, individuals have **multiple overlapping motivations**. PICCELS allows officers to layer motivational factors and address secondary motivations as needed to keep assets cooperative and engaged. For example:

- A conscience-driven asset might also be motivated by status (social injustice), making it important for the handler to balance appeals to moral duty with acknowledgment of their contributions.
- A money-motivated asset may be reinforced by ego appeals, reminding them of their “critical role” while maintaining financial incentives.

By broadening and refining the understanding of human motivations, **PICCELS** helps intelligence officers create a more adaptable and dynamic approach to asset recruitment and retention, ultimately enhancing the effectiveness of intelligence operations.
