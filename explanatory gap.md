Explanatory Gap

### Explanatory Gap

**Definition:** The explanatory gap refers to the difficulty in explaining how physical processes in the brain give rise to subjective experiences, also known as qualia. This concept highlights the gap between objective scientific descriptions of brain activity and the subjective quality of conscious experience.

### Origin and Development

#### Historical Context

The term "explanatory gap" was popularized by philosopher Joseph Levine in his 1983 paper "Materialism and Qualia: The Explanatory Gap." Levine argued that even if we have a complete physical explanation of the brain, it remains unclear how these physical processes result in the qualitative aspects of experience.

#### Key Components

- **Qualia:** These are the subjective, qualitative aspects of experiences (e.g., what it feels like to see red or taste chocolate).
- **Physical Processes:** These include the neural activities and mechanisms described by neuroscience.
- **The Gap:** The explanatory gap is the challenge of bridging the understanding between these two realms.

### Philosophical Implications

#### The Hard Problem of Consciousness

The explanatory gap is closely related to what philosopher David Chalmers calls the "hard problem of consciousness." This problem distinguishes between:

- **Easy Problems:** These involve explaining cognitive functions and behaviors (e.g., memory, perception) through physical processes.
- **Hard Problem:** This involves explaining why and how physical processes in the brain give rise to subjective experiences.

#### Challenges to Physicalism

Physicalism is the view that everything about the mind can be explained in physical terms. The explanatory gap challenges this view by suggesting that physical explanations may never fully account for subjective experiences.

- **Incompleteness:** Some philosophers argue that the persistent gap indicates a fundamental incompleteness in physicalist theories of the mind.
- **Non-Reductive Approaches:** Others propose non-reductive approaches, suggesting that consciousness cannot be fully reduced to physical processes.

### Responses to the Explanatory Gap

#### Philosophical Theories

1. **Dualism:** Proposes that the mind and body are fundamentally different kinds of substances or properties. This view posits that physical processes cannot fully explain mental phenomena because they belong to different realms.
   
2. **Property Dualism:** Suggests that mental properties are non-physical properties that emerge from physical substrates. Thus, the explanatory gap reflects the difference between these [[emergent properties]] and their physical bases.

3. **Panpsychism:** The idea that consciousness is a fundamental feature of the universe, present to some degree in all things. This approach attempts to integrate consciousness into the basic fabric of reality.

4. **Functionalism:** Proposes that mental states are defined by their functional roles rather than by their physical substrates. This view suggests that understanding these functional roles might help bridge the explanatory gap.

#### Scientific Approaches

1. **Neuroscientific Research:** Ongoing research aims to identify the neural correlates of consciousness (NCCs) to understand which brain processes correspond with specific experiences.

2. **Integrated Information Theory (IIT):** Proposes that consciousness arises from the integration of information within a system. The theory attempts to quantify consciousness and identify the conditions under which it occurs.

3. **Global Workspace Theory (GWT):** Suggests that consciousness results from information being globally accessible in the brain's workspace. This theory focuses on the mechanisms that allow information to be broadcast across different brain regions.

### Examples Illustrating the Explanatory Gap

#### Mary's Room

In the thought experiment "Mary's Room," proposed by Frank Jackson, Mary knows all the physical facts about color vision but has never seen color. When she finally sees color, she gains new knowledgeâ€”what it is like to experience color. This highlights the gap between physical knowledge and subjective experience.

#### Philosophical Zombies

Philosophical zombies are hypothetical beings that are physically identical to humans but lack conscious experience. The possibility of such beings raises questions about the sufficiency of physical explanations for consciousness and highlights the explanatory gap.

### Summary

The explanatory gap underscores the challenge of explaining how physical processes in the brain give rise to subjective experiences. This gap poses significant questions for physicalist theories of the mind and highlights the limits of current scientific and philosophical approaches to understanding consciousness. While various theories and scientific models strive to bridge this gap, it remains one of the most profound and persistent issues in the philosophy of mind and cognitive science.
