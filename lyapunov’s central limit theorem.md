Lyapunov’s Central Limit Theorem


**ASSISTANT**

Lyapunov’s Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is an extension of the classical central limit theorem that applies to sequences of independent, but not necessarily identically distributed, random variables. It provides a set of conditions under which the normalized sum of such variables converges to a normal distribution.

### Statement of Lyapunov’s Central Limit Theorem

Let \(\{X_i\}_{i=1}^n\) be a sequence of independent random variables with means \(E[X_i] = \mu_i\) and variances \(\text{Var}(X_i) = \sigma_i^2\). Define the normalized sum of these random variables as:
$$ S_n = \sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \mu_i), $$
and let \(\sigma_n^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n \sigma_i^2\) be the total variance of the sum \(S_n\).

Lyapunov’s condition involves the third central moments of the \(X_i\). Specifically, the Lyapunov condition states that for some \(\delta > 0\),
$$ \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{\sigma_n^{2+\delta}} \sum_{i=1}^n E\left[|X_i - \mu_i|^{2+\delta}\right] = 0. $$

### Theorem

If the Lyapunov condition is satisfied for some \(\delta > 0\), then the normalized sum \( S_n / \sigma_n \) converges in distribution to a standard normal distribution:
$$ \frac{S_n}{\sigma_n} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \mu_i)}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n \sigma_i^2}} \xrightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}(0,1) \quad \text{as} \quad n \to \infty. $$

### Proof Sketch

The proof of Lyapunov’s CLT involves several steps:

1. **Moment Bound and Standardization**:
   Normalize the variables \(X_i\) by their standard deviations \(\sigma_i\):
   $$ Z_i = \frac{X_i - \mu_i}{\sigma_i}. $$
   Then the sum \( S_n \) can be written as:
   $$ \frac{S_n}{\sigma_n} = \frac{1}{\sigma_n} \sum_{i=1}^n \sigma_i Z_i. $$

2. **Central Limit Theorem for Standardized Variables**:
   Apply the classical CLT to the standardized variables \(Z_i\). The Lyapunov condition ensures that the sum of the higher moments of the \(Z_i\) is small, thus controlling the contribution of large deviations.

3. **Characteristic Functions**:
   Use characteristic functions to show that the sum of the normalized variables converges to the characteristic function of the standard normal distribution. The Lyapunov condition is used to handle the truncation error in the characteristic function approach.

### Applications

Lyapunov’s CLT is particularly useful in situations where the random variables are not identically distributed. Some common applications include:

1. **Sum of Non-Identically Distributed Random Variables**:
   Ensures that the sum of a sequence of independent random variables, even if they have different variances and distributions, converges to a normal distribution under the Lyapunov condition.

2. **Statistical Inference**:
   Provides the theoretical foundation for the asymptotic normality of estimators in non-homogeneous settings, such as in regression analysis with heteroskedastic errors.

3. **Risk Management and Finance**:
   Used in risk management to assess the aggregate risk of a portfolio of diverse assets with different risk characteristics.

### Example

Consider a sequence of independent random variables \(\{X_i\}\) with means \(\mu_i\) and variances \(\sigma_i^2\). Suppose \(X_i\) represents the profit from the \(i\)-th investment, and these investments have different expected returns and variances.

To apply Lyapunov’s CLT, check the Lyapunov condition:
$$ \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{\left(\sum_{i=1}^n \sigma_i^2\right)^{1+\delta/2}} \sum_{i=1}^n E\left[|X_i - \mu_i|^{2+\delta}\right] = 0. $$

If this condition holds for some \(\delta > 0\), then the total profit \( S_n = \sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \mu_i) \) normalized by its standard deviation \(\sigma_n\) will be approximately normally distributed for large \(n\).

### Comparison with Other CLTs

1. **Classical CLT**:
   The classical CLT requires i.i.d. random variables. Lyapunov’s CLT relaxes this to allow for non-identically distributed variables.

2. **Lindeberg-Feller CLT**:
   The Lindeberg-Feller CLT also generalizes the classical CLT and uses the Lindeberg condition, which is weaker than the Lyapunov condition. The Lindeberg condition is often preferred because it applies to a broader class of random variables.
