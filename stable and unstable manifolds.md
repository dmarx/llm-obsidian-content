# Stable and Unstable Manifolds

In [[dynamical systems]] theory, stable and unstable manifolds are fundamental geometric structures that organize the global dynamics around [[equilibrium points]]. These manifolds generalize the notion of [[eigenvectors]] in linear systems to nonlinear contexts.

## Mathematical Definition

Let $\dot{\mathbf{x}} = \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x})$ be a [[smooth dynamical system]] with flow $\phi_t$ and equilibrium point $\mathbf{p}$.

### Stable Manifold

The [[stable manifold]] $W^s(\mathbf{p})$ is defined as:

$W^s(\mathbf{p}) = \{\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n : \lim_{t \to \infty} \phi_t(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{p}\}$

This represents the set of all points whose trajectories approach $\mathbf{p}$ as time moves forward.

### Unstable Manifold

The [[unstable manifold]] $W^u(\mathbf{p})$ is defined as:

$W^u(\mathbf{p}) = \{\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n : \lim_{t \to -\infty} \phi_t(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{p}\}$

This represents the set of all points whose trajectories approach $\mathbf{p}$ as time moves backward.

## Local Manifold Theory

For [[hyperbolic equilibrium points]], the [[Stable Manifold Theorem]] guarantees that:

1. $W^s(\mathbf{p})$ and $W^u(\mathbf{p})$ are [[immersed manifolds]]
2. They are tangent to the stable and unstable eigenspaces of the [[linearization]] at $\mathbf{p}$
3. Their dimensions are equal to the number of eigenvalues with negative and positive real parts, respectively

### Local Stable and Unstable Manifolds

The [[local stable manifold]] $W^s_{loc}(\mathbf{p})$ is the intersection of $W^s(\mathbf{p})$ with a neighborhood of $\mathbf{p}$. Similar definition holds for the [[local unstable manifold]] $W^u_{loc}(\mathbf{p})$.

## Formal Properties

1. **Invariance**: Both manifolds are [[flow-invariant sets]]:
   - $\phi_t(W^s(\mathbf{p})) \subseteq W^s(\mathbf{p})$
   - $\phi_t(W^u(\mathbf{p})) \subseteq W^u(\mathbf{p})$

2. **Smoothness**: Under suitable conditions, both manifolds are as smooth as the vector field $\mathbf{f}$

3. **[[Exponential Dichotomy]]**: Points on $W^s(\mathbf{p})$ approach $\mathbf{p}$ exponentially fast forward in time, while points on $W^u(\mathbf{p})$ approach exponentially in backward time

## Computational Approaches

### Linear Approximation
Near the equilibrium point, the manifolds can be approximated using the [[eigenvectors]] of the [[Jacobian matrix]] $D\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{p})$:

1. Stable manifold ≈ span of eigenvectors with negative real eigenvalues
2. Unstable manifold ≈ span of eigenvectors with positive real eigenvalues

### Numerical Methods

Common techniques include:
- [[Continuation methods]]
- [[Time integration methods]]
- [[Boundary value problem]] approaches
- [[Set-oriented methods]]

## Applications

Stable and unstable manifolds are crucial in:

1. **[[Transport Theory]]**: Understanding how regions of phase space communicate
2. **[[Chaos Theory]]**: [[Homoclinic]] and [[heteroclinic orbits]] arise from manifold intersections
3. **[[Control Theory]]**: Designing controllers to exploit natural dynamics
4. **[[Chemical Reaction Dynamics]]**: Understanding reaction pathways and transition states

## Extensions

### Center Manifolds

When there are eigenvalues with zero real part, a [[center manifold]] $W^c(\mathbf{p})$ exists tangent to the corresponding eigenspace. The [[Center Manifold Theorem]] provides conditions for its existence and properties.

### Normally Hyperbolic Invariant Manifolds

The theory extends to [[normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds]], where stable and unstable manifolds are defined for invariant sets more general than equilibrium points.

## Relationship to Other Concepts

- [[Basin boundaries]] often involve stable manifolds
- [[Lyapunov functions]] provide complementary stability information
- [[Morse decompositions]] are organized by stable and unstable manifolds
- [[Conley index theory]] uses these manifolds to characterize dynamics
