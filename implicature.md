### Implicature

**Implicature** is a concept introduced by philosopher H.P. Grice to explain how speakers often convey more meaning than what is explicitly stated in their utterances. This additional meaning is derived from the context, the assumed cooperation between speakers, and the conversational norms or maxims.

### Types of Implicature

1. **Conventional Implicature**
   - **Definition**: Implicatures that are tied to specific words or phrases and are part of their conventional meaning.
   - **Example**: "John is poor but honest."
     - **Conventional Implicature**: The word "but" implies a contrast between being poor and being honest.

2. **Conversational Implicature**
   - **Definition**: Implicatures that arise from the context of the conversation and the assumption that the speaker is adhering to the Cooperative Principle and its maxims.
   - **Example**:
     - **Statement**: "Can you pass the salt?"
     - **Literal Meaning**: Asking if the listener is capable of passing the salt.
     - **Conversational Implicature**: Requesting the listener to pass the salt.

### Gricean Maxims and Conversational Implicature

Conversational implicatures often arise when speakers flout one or more of the Gricean Maxims. These maxims are:

1. **Maxim of Quantity**: Provide the right amount of information.
   - **Flouting Example**: "Some students passed the exam."
     - **Implicature**: Not all students passed the exam. The speaker is intentionally providing less information to imply that some did not pass.

2. **Maxim of Quality**: Strive to be truthful.
   - **Flouting Example**: "I could eat a horse."
     - **Implicature**: The speaker is very hungry. The literal statement is false, but the exaggeration implies a strong sense of hunger.

3. **Maxim of Relation (Relevance)**: Be relevant.
   - **Flouting Example**: (In response to "How was your day?") "Well, I found a new podcast to listen to."
     - **Implicature**: The speaker might be indicating that the day was uneventful or that this podcast was a highlight.

4. **Maxim of Manner**: Be clear.
   - **Flouting Example**: "The lecture was, uh, you know, interesting."
     - **Implicature**: The speaker might be suggesting that the lecture was boring or not actually interesting, using vagueness to soften the critique.

### Properties of Conversational Implicature

1. **Calculability**: The implicature can be inferred from the literal meaning of the utterance, the context, and the assumption that the speaker is adhering to the Cooperative Principle.
2. **Cancellability**: The implicature can be canceled without contradiction by adding further information.
   - **Example**: "Some students passed the exam. In fact, all of them did."
3. **Non-detachability**: The implicature is tied to the content of the utterance, not the specific wording.
4. **Non-conventionality**: The implicature is not part of the conventional meaning of the words used but arises from the context and the Cooperative Principle.

### Examples of Conversational Implicature

1. **Scalar Implicature**:
   - **Statement**: "Some of the cookies are gone."
   - **Implicature**: Not all the cookies are gone. The use of "some" suggests that only a portion is gone, implying that some remain.

2. **Particularized Conversational Implicature**:
   - **Context**: At a party.
   - **Statement**: "It's getting late."
   - **Implicature**: The speaker is suggesting that it might be time to leave. The lateness of the hour is relevant in this context to imply a suggestion to end the party or conversation.

3. **Generalized Conversational Implicature**:
   - **Statement**: "He is meeting a woman this evening."
   - **Implicature**: The woman is not his wife, mother, or sister. This arises from the general assumption that if it were a close family member, the speaker would specify that relationship.

### Formalizing Implicature

Implicature can be formally represented using logical frameworks and context models:

1. **Representation of Context**: Let \( C \) be the context, which includes the shared knowledge and conversational background.
2. **Literal Meaning**: Let \( L \) be the literal meaning of the utterance.
3. **Implicature**: Let \( I \) be the inferred meaning based on the context and the Cooperative Principle.

The relationship can be expressed as:

$$ I = f(L, C, M) $$

where \( M \) represents the maxims. The function \( f \) captures the inferential process that leads from the literal meaning and context to the implicature.

### Conclusion

Implicature is a key concept in understanding how communication functions beyond literal meaning. It relies on context, shared knowledge, and the Cooperative Principle to convey additional meanings that are not explicitly stated. Grice's theories on implicature have been foundational in the fields of [[pragmatics]], [[linguistics]], and the [[philosophy of language]], providing a framework for analyzing and interpreting the nuances of human communication.
