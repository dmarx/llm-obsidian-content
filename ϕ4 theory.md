ϕ4 Theory


**ASSISTANT**

\(\phi^4\) theory is a fundamental model in quantum field theory and statistical mechanics, often used to study phase transitions and critical phenomena. It provides a simple yet rich framework for understanding spontaneous symmetry breaking and renormalization.

## Overview

### Lagrangian and Action

The Lagrangian density for \(\phi^4\) theory in \(d\)-dimensional spacetime is given by:

$$
\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2} (\partial_\mu \phi)(\partial^\mu \phi) - \frac{1}{2} m^2 \phi^2 - \frac{\lambda}{4!} \phi^4
$$

where:
- \(\phi\) is a real scalar field,
- \(m\) is the mass of the field,
- \(\lambda\) is the coupling constant representing the strength of the self-interaction.

The corresponding action is:

$$
S[\phi] = \int d^d x \, \mathcal{L}
$$

### Equations of Motion

The equations of motion are derived from the Euler-Lagrange equation:

$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \phi} - \partial_\mu \left( \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial (\partial^\mu \phi)} \right) = 0
$$

For the \(\phi^4\) Lagrangian, this gives the Klein-Gordon equation with a \(\phi^3\) term:

$$
\Box \phi + m^2 \phi + \frac{\lambda}{3!} \phi^3 = 0
$$

where \(\Box = \partial^\mu \partial_\mu\) is the d'Alembertian operator.

## Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking

\(\phi^4\) theory exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking depending on the sign of \(m^2\):

1. **Symmetric Phase (\(m^2 > 0\))**: The potential \(V(\phi) = \frac{1}{2} m^2 \phi^2 + \frac{\lambda}{4!} \phi^4\) has a single minimum at \(\phi = 0\).

2. **Broken Symmetry Phase (\(m^2 < 0\))**: The potential becomes \(V(\phi) = -\frac{1}{2} |m^2| \phi^2 + \frac{\lambda}{4!} \phi^4\), resulting in a "Mexican hat" shape with minima at \(\phi = \pm v\), where \(v = \sqrt{\frac{6 |m^2|}{\lambda}}\).

In the broken symmetry phase, the field acquires a nonzero vacuum expectation value (vev), \(\langle \phi \rangle = \pm v\), leading to spontaneous symmetry breaking.

## Renormalization and Divergences

In quantum field theory, \(\phi^4\) theory is not free from divergences. Renormalization is the process of dealing with these infinities by redefining the parameters of the theory. 

### Renormalized Lagrangian

The renormalized Lagrangian includes counterterms to absorb the divergences:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{ren}} = \frac{1}{2} Z_\phi (\partial_\mu \phi)(\partial^\mu \phi) - \frac{1}{2} Z_m m^2 \phi^2 - \frac{Z_\lambda \lambda}{4!} \phi^4
$$

where \(Z_\phi\), \(Z_m\), and \(Z_\lambda\) are renormalization constants.

### Renormalization Group Equations

The renormalization group (RG) equations describe how the parameters of the theory change with the energy scale \(\mu\):

$$
\mu \frac{d \lambda}{d \mu} = \beta(\lambda)
$$

The [[beta function]] \(\beta(\lambda)\) determines the running of the coupling constant. For \(\phi^4\) theory in four dimensions, the one-loop [[beta function]] is:

$$
\beta(\lambda) = \frac{3 \lambda^2}{16 \pi^2}
$$

## Applications

### Critical Phenomena and Phase Transitions

\(\phi^4\) theory is widely used to describe critical phenomena and continuous phase transitions. Near the critical point, the behavior of physical quantities can be captured by \(\phi^4\) theory.

### Higgs Mechanism

In the Standard Model of particle physics, the Higgs field is described by a complex scalar field with a \(\phi^4\) potential. Spontaneous symmetry breaking in this context gives mass to gauge bosons and fermions.

### Statistical Mechanics

In statistical mechanics, \(\phi^4\) theory appears in the Landau-Ginzburg model of phase transitions, describing the behavior of the order parameter near the critical point.

## Mathematical Formalism

### Path Integral Formulation

The path integral formulation provides a framework for calculating correlation functions and generating functionals:

$$
Z = \int \mathcal{D}\phi \, e^{iS[\phi]}
$$

Correlation functions are obtained as functional derivatives of the generating functional \(Z[J]\) with respect to the source term \(J(x)\):

$$
\langle 0 | T\{\phi(x_1) \phi(x_2) \} | 0 \rangle = \frac{1}{Z[0]} \frac{\delta^2 Z[J]}{\delta J(x_1) \delta J(x_2)} \Bigg|_{J=0}
$$

### Feynman Diagrams

Perturbation theory in \(\phi^4\) theory involves Feynman diagrams with vertices corresponding to the \(\phi^4\) interaction. The rules for constructing and interpreting these diagrams provide a systematic way to calculate scattering amplitudes and correlation functions.
