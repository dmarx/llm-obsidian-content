The paper *"An index for unitarizable 𝔰𝔩(m|n)-supermodules"* by Steffen Schmidt and Johannes Walcher develops a mathematical framework for computing character-valued invariants—specifically, superconformal indices—for unitarizable representations of the special linear Lie superalgebras 𝔰𝔩(m|n), where m ≥ 2 and n ≥ 1. These indices are significant in theoretical physics, particularly in the study of supersymmetric quantum field theories, as they remain constant under deformations of physical parameters and capture information about "short" representations that do not recombine into long ones.

The authors provide a self-contained exposition, including background on the structure theory of Lie superalgebras, unitarizable supermodules, the Duflo-Serganova functor, and elements of Harish-Chandra theory. A key result is an "index theorem" that relates the counting of atypical constituents in a unitarizable 𝔰𝔩(m|n)-supermodule to the character-valued Q-Witten index, expressed as a supertrace over the full supermodule. This framework also allows for the formulation of the formal superdimension of holomorphic discrete series 𝔰𝔩(m|n)-supermodules.

While the paper is not yet available on arXiv, related work by Steffen Schmidt on Dirac cohomology and unitarizable supermodules over Lie superalgebras of type A(m|n) can be found in his earlier publication:

This work explores the relationships among the Dirac operator, Dirac cohomology, and unitarizable supermodules, providing insights that may complement the index theorem discussed in the aforementioned paper.
