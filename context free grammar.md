Context free grammar


**ASSISTANT**

A **context-free grammar (CFG)** is a type of formal grammar that is used to generate all possible strings in a given formal language. A CFG consists of a set of production rules that describe how non-terminal symbols can be transformed into terminal symbols. The structure of a CFG is defined by four components, typically denoted as $G = (V, \Sigma, R, S)$ where:

- $V$ is a finite set of non-terminal symbols.
- $\Sigma$ is a finite set of terminal symbols, where $V \cap \Sigma = \emptyset$.
- $R$ is a finite set of production rules, each of the form $A \rightarrow \alpha$ where $A \in V$ and $\alpha \in (V \cup \Sigma)^*$.
- $S \in V$ is the start symbol.

### Components of a CFG

1. **Non-terminal symbols ($V$)**: These are placeholders for patterns of terminal symbols that can be generated. They are also called variables.

2. **Terminal symbols ($\Sigma$)**: These are the actual symbols of the language (the alphabet of the language). They form the strings of the language generated by the grammar.

3. **Production rules ($R$)**: These rules define how non-terminal symbols can be replaced by groups of terminal and/or non-terminal symbols. A rule $A \rightarrow \alpha$ means that the non-terminal $A$ can be replaced by the string $\alpha$.

4. **Start symbol ($S$)**: This is the non-terminal symbol from which the generation of strings begins. It serves as the root of the derivation tree.

### Example of a CFG

Consider a simple CFG that generates balanced parentheses:

- $V = \{S\}$
- $\Sigma = \{(, )\}$
- $R = \{S \rightarrow SS, S \rightarrow (S), S \rightarrow \varepsilon\}$
- $S$ is the start symbol.

In this example, the rules can be interpreted as follows:
- $S \rightarrow SS$: A string derived from $S$ can be split into two substrings, each derived from $S$.
- $S \rightarrow (S)$: A string derived from $S$ can be a pair of parentheses enclosing another string derived from $S$.
- $S \rightarrow \varepsilon$: A string derived from $S$ can be the empty string.

### Formal Definition

A CFG can be formally defined as follows:

$$
G = (V, \Sigma, R, S)
$$

where:
- $V = \{A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n\}$ is a set of non-terminal symbols.
- $\Sigma = \{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_m\}$ is a set of terminal symbols.
- $R$ is a set of production rules of the form $A \rightarrow \alpha$ where $A \in V$ and $\alpha \in (V \cup \Sigma)^*$.
- $S \in V$ is the start symbol.

### Parse Trees and Derivations

A **parse tree** is a tree representation of the syntactic structure of a string according to a CFG. The root of the tree is the start symbol $S$, and each internal node is labeled with a non-terminal. The children of a node correspond to the symbols on the right-hand side of the production rule applied at that node.

### Applications of CFG

- **Programming languages**: CFGs are used to define the syntax of programming languages.
- **Natural language processing (NLP)**: CFGs are used in parsing sentences to understand their grammatical structure.
- **Compiler design**: CFGs are used to create parsers, which check the syntactic correctness of code.
