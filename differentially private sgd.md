Differentially Private SGD


**ASSISTANT**

**Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD)** is a modification of the standard [[Stochastic Gradient Descent]] (SGD) optimization algorithm that ensures [[differential privacy]] during the training of machine learning models. DP-SGD is particularly useful for training models on sensitive data (e.g., medical records or financial data), where it's important to prevent the model from leaking information about any specific individual in the dataset.

The main idea behind DP-SGD is to add carefully calibrated noise to the gradient computations during the training process, ensuring that the influence of any single data point on the final model is limited, and thus providing a [[differential privacy]] guarantee.

### Motivation

In standard SGD, the model's parameters are updated iteratively using gradients computed from mini-batches of training data. However, without modification, these updates can inadvertently reveal information about the individual data points contributing to the gradient. DP-SGD mitigates this by ensuring that the contributions of any single data point to the gradients are both:
1. **Bounded**: Individual gradients are clipped to limit their influence.
2. **Noisy**: Random noise is added to the gradients to mask the exact contribution of any single data point.

This combination ensures that the resulting model satisfies [[differential privacy]].

### Overview of Stochastic Gradient Descent

In standard SGD, the model parameters $\theta$ are updated using gradients of the loss function. For a dataset $D = \{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n\}$, the model is trained by minimizing a loss function $\mathcal{L}(\theta, x_i)$ that measures how well the model with parameters $\theta$ fits the data point $x_i$.

The SGD update rule for a mini-batch $B_t \subseteq D$ at time step $t$ is given by:
$$
\theta_{t+1} = \theta_t - \eta \nabla \mathcal{L}_B(\theta_t)
$$
where:
- $\eta$ is the learning rate,
- $\nabla \mathcal{L}_B(\theta_t)$ is the gradient of the loss function over the mini-batch $B_t$:
  $$
  \nabla \mathcal{L}_B(\theta_t) = \frac{1}{|B_t|} \sum_{x_i \in B_t} \nabla \mathcal{L}(\theta_t, x_i)
  $$

### Differentially Private SGD

To make this process differentially private, DP-SGD modifies the gradient computation step by **clipping** the individual gradients and adding **Gaussian noise** to the sum of the gradients. This ensures that the influence of any single data point is limited and that the final parameter updates are obfuscated by noise.

The main steps of DP-SGD are as follows:

1. **Clipping Gradients**: Each per-example gradient is clipped to have a bounded norm. For each data point $x_i$ in the mini-batch $B_t$, compute the gradient $\nabla \mathcal{L}(\theta_t, x_i)$, and clip it to a maximum norm $C$:
   $$
   \tilde{\nabla} \mathcal{L}(\theta_t, x_i) = \frac{\nabla \mathcal{L}(\theta_t, x_i)}{\max\left(1, \frac{\|\nabla \mathcal{L}(\theta_t, x_i)\|_2}{C}\right)}
   $$
   This ensures that no individual gradient contributes disproportionately to the model update.

2. **Adding Noise**: After computing the clipped gradients for all examples in the mini-batch, the noisy average gradient is computed by adding Gaussian noise:
   $$
   \bar{g}_t = \frac{1}{|B_t|} \sum_{x_i \in B_t} \tilde{\nabla} \mathcal{L}(\theta_t, x_i) + \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 C^2 I)
   $$
   where $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 C^2 I)$ is Gaussian noise with zero mean and standard deviation $\sigma C$, and $I$ is the identity matrix. The noise ensures that the individual gradients cannot be reverse-engineered from the overall update.

3. **Updating the Model Parameters**: The model parameters are then updated using the noisy gradient:
   $$
   \theta_{t+1} = \theta_t - \eta \bar{g}_t
   $$

### Differential Privacy Guarantee

By clipping the gradients and adding noise, DP-SGD ensures that the contributions of individual data points to the model updates are indistinguishable, satisfying [[differential privacy]].

Formally, DP-SGD provides $(\epsilon, \delta)$-[[differential privacy]] over the training process. This means that the model’s output (i.e., the trained parameters $\theta$) is almost as likely to have been generated from a dataset including a particular individual as it would have been from a dataset without that individual, with the privacy loss controlled by the parameters $\epsilon$ and $\delta$. These parameters depend on several factors:
- **Gradient clipping norm** $C$: Limits how much any individual data point can influence the gradient.
- **Noise scale** $\sigma$: Determines how much noise is added relative to the clipped gradient norm.
- **Batch size** $|B_t|$: Affects how many data points are used for each noisy gradient estimate.
- **Number of iterations** $T$: More iterations increase the total privacy loss, which is managed through composition properties of [[differential privacy]].

### Privacy Accounting: Moments Accountant

The **Moments Accountant** is a technique used to track the cumulative privacy loss across multiple iterations of DP-SGD. As each mini-batch contributes to the overall privacy loss, the Moments Accountant keeps track of the privacy guarantees over the course of training, allowing tighter bounds on the $(\epsilon, \delta)$ privacy parameters than simpler composition techniques (such as the basic sequential composition rule).

### Advantages of DP-SGD

1. **Scalable to Large Datasets**: By working with mini-batches, DP-SGD is scalable to large datasets, which is critical for modern machine learning tasks.
2. **Strong Privacy Guarantees**: The [[differential privacy]] guarantee ensures that the trained model does not reveal sensitive information about individuals in the dataset, even when queried repeatedly.
3. **Compatibility with Deep Learning**: DP-SGD can be applied to deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, making it feasible to train differentially private neural networks.
  
### Trade-offs

- **Utility vs. Privacy**: Adding noise to gradients introduces randomness into the training process, which can degrade model performance. The challenge is to find a balance between privacy (smaller $\epsilon$ and larger $\sigma$) and utility (accuracy of the trained model).
  
- **Computational Cost**: DP-SGD introduces additional computation due to gradient clipping and noise addition. Moreover, the noise scale needs to be chosen carefully to ensure sufficient privacy while preserving model performance.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Choosing appropriate values for the clipping norm $C$, noise scale $\sigma$, and batch size $|B_t|$ is crucial for both privacy and model utility. These hyperparameters need to be tuned based on the specific application and dataset.

### Example Use Case

Consider a machine learning model that uses sensitive health data to predict the likelihood of disease. The model is trained using DP-SGD to ensure that the inclusion or exclusion of any individual’s health record does not significantly affect the final model. This means that even though the model learns from sensitive data, an external observer cannot infer any information about specific individuals based on the model's predictions or parameters.

### Conclusion

**Differentially Private SGD (DP-SGD)** is a practical and effective method for training machine learning models with [[differential privacy]] guarantees. By modifying the standard SGD algorithm to clip gradients and add noise, DP-SGD ensures that individual data points have limited influence on the model, protecting the privacy of individuals in the training set. It has become a standard approach for privacy-preserving machine learning, especially in high-stakes applications like healthcare, finance, and social data analysis, where privacy is paramount.
