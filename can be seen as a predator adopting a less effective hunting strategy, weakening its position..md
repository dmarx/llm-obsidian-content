> can be seen as a predator adopting a less effective hunting strategy, weakening its position.

i was thinking more along the lines of treating Boeing simultaneously as an organism in a system in which it was competing with MD, then as an environment within which the former boeing ecological community was forced to compete with the MD ecological community, which ultimately consumed Boeing replacing their successful survival strategies with MD's maladaptive strategies, resulting in the exploitation of the environment to its constituents (executives) detriment

Your interpretation provides a deeper and more nuanced view of the Boeing-McDonnell Douglas scenario through the lens of ecological dynamics, specifically focusing on internal competition and ecosystem exploitation. Here, we can extend the ecological analogy to include concepts such as competitive exclusion, parasitism, and the degradation of a previously balanced ecosystem. Let’s elaborate on this perspective:

### Boeing and McDonnell Douglas: Competitive Exclusion and Internal Ecosystem Shift

**Competitive Exclusion**:
- **Pre-Merger Competition**: Initially, Boeing and McDonnell Douglas were separate entities competing in the same industry ecosystem. Each had its strategies and organizational cultures, akin to different species competing within the same ecological niche.
- **Post-Merger Dynamics**: After the merger, rather than integrating harmoniously, the McDonnell Douglas corporate culture and business strategies began to dominate within the new organizational structure. This can be seen as an invasive species outcompeting and gradually excluding the native species (the original Boeing culture).

**Internal Ecosystem Change**:
- **Dominance of McDonnell Douglas Strategies**: The aggressive cost-cutting and profit-maximizing strategies of McDonnell Douglas, which might have been adaptive under different conditions or within their original context, were maladaptive when imposed on Boeing’s complex product systems and safety-centric culture. This scenario mirrors an invasive species altering an ecosystem’s balance, leading to long-term degradation.

- **Degradation of Boeing’s Ecosystem**: The new dominant corporate culture did not merely coexist; it replaced Boeing’s engineering-driven culture. This is akin to an invasive organism that not only outcompetes but fundamentally changes the environment, reducing biodiversity (in this case, diversity of ideas and approaches) and destabilizing the ecosystem.

### Exploitation and Ecosystem Collapse

**Exploitation of Resources**:
- **Short-Term Gains at Long-Term Costs**: The shift towards aggressive cost management and short-term profitability can be likened to overexploitation of an ecosystem’s resources, where the immediate extraction of value leads to long-term damage to the system’s health and sustainability. In Boeing’s case, this manifested in compromised safety protocols and declining product quality — the natural resources of its ecosystem.

**Impact on Constituents**:
- **Deterioration of System Health**: Just as ecological overexploitation leads to habitat destruction and loss of species, the overemphasis on cost-cutting and efficiency led to a loss of quality and safety, culminating in catastrophic failures such as the 737 MAX incidents. This not only affected the company’s bottom line but also its reputation and stakeholder trust.

### Recovery and Restoration

**Restoration Ecology**:
- **Reintroducing Native Species**: For Boeing, recovery might involve reintroducing and reinforcing the ‘native’ corporate values and strategies that focus on quality, safety, and engineering excellence. This could be seen as akin to reintroducing keystone species into an ecosystem to restore balance.

- **Sustainable Practices**: Moving forward, Boeing would need to adopt sustainable business practices that ensure long-term health and resilience. This includes fostering a culture of innovation, safety, and customer focus, much like sustainable farming practices that enhance soil health and crop yield.

In conclusion, using ecological analogies allows us to view the Boeing-McDonnell Douglas merger and its aftermath in terms of ecological competition, species dominance, and ecosystem exploitation and degradation. This perspective highlights the complex interactions within corporate mergers and the profound impacts of cultural and strategic shifts on corporate health and market position.
