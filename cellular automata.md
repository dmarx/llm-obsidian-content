### Cellular Automata

Cellular automata (CA) are discrete, abstract computational systems that have become fundamental in theoretical computer science, physics, complexity science, and mathematical biology. They consist of a grid of cells, each in one of a finite number of states, such as on or off. The grid can be in any finite number of dimensions, but the most common are one-dimensional and two-dimensional cellular automata.

#### Basic Structure

The setup for cellular automata involves:
- **Cells**: A regular grid of cells, each of which can be in one of a finite number of states.
- **Neighbors**: A defined neighborhood around each cell. Commonly, this might include the adjacent cells in 1D or 2D (e.g., von Neumann or Moore neighborhood in 2D).
- **Rules**: A set of rules that determine how the state of each cell changes in response to the states of its neighbors. These rules are applied simultaneously to all cells in the grid to produce a new generation of states.

#### Evolution

The evolution of a cellular automaton is determined by its rules, which are applied at each time step to all cells simultaneously. This application results in a sequence of states (or generations) that can exhibit complex behaviors, even from simple initial conditions and rules.

#### Examples of Cellular Automata

1. **[[Game of Life|Conway's Game of Life]]**: Perhaps the most famous cellular automaton, developed by John Conway. It is a two-dimensional CA where each cell has two possible states (alive or dead). The evolution rules are based on the number of alive neighbors, leading to complex and often surprising patterns from simple starting configurations.

2. **[[Elementary Cellular Automata|Elementary CA]]**: These are one-dimensional, with two possible states per cell and rules that depend only on the state of a cell and its immediate neighbors. An elementary CA's behavior can be classified into several types, from stable and oscillating structures to chaotic patterns.

3. **[[Langton's Ant|Langtonâ€™s Ant]]**: Another interesting example, where the automaton (the "ant") moves on a grid of cells according to the color of the cell it is currently on, which it then flips (e.g., from white to black or vice versa) as it moves.

#### Properties

- **Deterministic**: Unless explicitly introduced, there is no element of randomness in the rules of cellular automata; the same initial state always leads to the same evolution.
- **Discreteness**: Both space and time are discrete in cellular automata, with changes occurring at fixed time steps and positions.
- **Locality**: The state of each cell at a given time depends only on the states of nearby cells at the previous time step, reflecting a form of local interaction.

#### Applications

- **Simulation**: Cellular automata are used for simulating complex systems where global behavior emerges from the local interaction of components, such as traffic flow, spread of fire, growth of biological organisms, and more.
- **Pattern Generation**: They are employed in computer graphics for generating textures and patterns, owing to their ability to create complex visual outputs from simple rules.
- **Computational Theory**: Cellular automata can simulate a Turing machine and thus are capable of universal computation. This property makes them a subject of interest in the theory of computation and complexity.

#### Theoretical Implications

The study of cellular automata challenges and enriches our understanding of dynamical systems, particularly regarding how complex structures and behaviors emerge from simple and localized interactions. This has philosophical implications for theories about the nature of computation and the universe, suggesting that simple rules, applied uniformly, could potentially explain complex phenomena in systems ranging from the microcosmic to the cosmic scale.

Cellular automata, by embodying simplicity and localism in their operational structure, provide a powerful model for exploring the dynamics of complex systems, computational theory, and [[artificial life]].
