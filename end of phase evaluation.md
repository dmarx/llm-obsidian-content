### **Week 1: Surveillance Theory and Countersurveillance Fundamentals**
#### **Day 1-2: Introduction to Surveillance Operations**

These initial days introduce trainees to the fundamental principles, techniques, and psychology of surveillance, focusing on different types of surveillance and the common tactics used by professional teams. By the end of this section, trainees should understand the mechanics and behaviors of surveillance teams, as well as early indicators of being surveilled. Day 1 emphasizes theoretical knowledge, while Day 2 shifts toward analysis and hands-on exercises.

---

#### **Day 1: Surveillance Fundamentals and Types**

**Objective**: Develop foundational understanding of surveillance operations, including the types, purposes, and tactics of surveillance teams.

---

**Morning Session (3 hours)**

1. **Introduction to Surveillance and its Objectives**
   - **Lecture Content**:
     - **Purpose of Surveillance**: Surveillance as an intelligence-gathering technique and an essential part of counterintelligence, security, and operational tradecraft.
     - **Operational Scenarios**: Examples of contexts in which surveillance is used, including intelligence collection, following high-value targets, and threat assessment.
     - **Desired Outcomes**: Understanding surveillance as a tool to obtain information about a target’s routine, contacts, vulnerabilities, and possible operational intentions.
   - **Discussion**: Real-world examples (e.g., high-profile surveillance cases) that illustrate different surveillance outcomes and objectives.

2. **Types of Surveillance**
   - **Static Surveillance (Fixed-Point)**:
     - Definition: Stationary surveillance, often performed from fixed positions, like buildings or parked vehicles, with a clear line of sight.
     - Examples: Observing a target’s residence or workplace, tracking movements in specific high-risk locations.
     - Techniques: Using cover (e.g., tinted windows, hidden cameras) and blending into the environment without attracting attention.
   - **Mobile Surveillance**:
     - Definition: Following a target who is on the move, either on foot or in a vehicle.
     - Techniques: Relay handoffs, staggered positioning, and “box” formations where multiple surveillance members cover different angles.
   - **Technical Surveillance**:
     - Definition: Use of technical devices like GPS trackers, RF-based audio surveillance, and covert cameras.
     - Techniques: Placement of tracking devices on vehicles, body-worn devices for live audio transmission, and use of long-range lenses.
   - **Combined Surveillance**:
     - Definition: Integrating static, mobile, and technical methods to monitor a target across different environments.
     - Examples: A surveillance team could use a GPS device to track a target vehicle’s movements and deploy foot agents in specific locations to observe any stops or meetings.

3. **Psychology of Surveillance**
   - **Lecture Content**:
     - **Understanding Surveillance Psychology**: Surveillance is based on staying unnoticed, so agents must exhibit behavioral control, patience, and adaptability.
     - **Behavioral Patterns**: Surveillance teams have specific behaviors like maintaining a “neutral appearance,” predictable positioning, and using “natural” movements to avoid detection.
   - **Activity**: Video Analysis of Surveillance Behaviors – Trainees watch footage of controlled surveillance scenarios, identifying signs of typical surveillance techniques and team positioning.

**Afternoon Session (3 hours)**

4. **Building Blocks of Surveillance**
   - **Positioning and Movement Techniques**:
     - **Shadowing**: Following a target discreetly while remaining at an optimal distance.
     - **Parallel Surveillance**: Moving in parallel streets or paths to reduce chances of direct observation.
     - **Leapfrogging**: Alternating agents to avoid detection while covering longer routes.
     - **Overwatch Positions**: Strategic placement in high-traffic locations to maintain visibility over long periods without movement.
   - **Surveillance Formation Techniques**:
     - **Single Agent**: One operative follows the target, using obstacles and keeping significant distance to minimize detection risk.
     - **Two-Person Team**: Two agents alternate tracking and observing from different distances, reducing the likelihood of a target noticing the same individual repeatedly.
     - **Box and Diamond Formations**: Larger teams where members cover various angles (front, side, and rear), creating an invisible perimeter around the target.

5. **Surveillance Tools and Equipment**
   - **Visual Surveillance**:
     - High-power binoculars and optical scopes for distant observation.
     - Cameras with telephoto lenses to capture detail without close approach.
   - **Audio Surveillance**:
     - RF microphones for remote audio, sound triangulation, and laser microphones for picking up vibrations through glass.
   - **Electronic and Technical Tools**:
     - GPS trackers for vehicle tracking and RF detectors to monitor for other surveillance teams in the area.

6. **Group Discussion and Q&A**
   - **Purpose**: Reflect on surveillance techniques and discuss detection challenges from the target’s perspective.
   - **Activity**: Trainees review a case study involving surveillance challenges and successes, emphasizing psychological control and the patience needed in long-duration operations.

#### **Day 2: Analysis of Surveillance Indicators and Initial Detection Techniques**

**Objective**: Equip trainees with basic detection skills by analyzing surveillance behaviors, common indicators, and implementing initial countersurveillance observation techniques.

---

**Morning Session (3 hours)**

1. **Recognizing Indicators of Surveillance**
   - **Lecture Content**:
     - **Behavioral Signs of Surveillance**: Identifying repetitive patterns, individuals maintaining proximity without direct contact, vehicles that seem to follow, and “street watchers” who provide overwatch.
     - **Environmental Clues**: Recognizing patterns such as cars repeatedly parked in the same location, unusual foot traffic, and individuals appearing in multiple locations.
   - **Exercise**: Surveillance Pattern Identification Drill – Trainees observe staged surveillance behaviors in a controlled environment, noting the telltale signs of hostile surveillance teams.
   - **Skills Practiced**: Observational acuity, interpreting behavioral cues, and distinguishing normal from suspicious behavior.

2. **Introduction to Surveillance Detection Routes (SDRs)**
   - **Content**:
     - **Definition and Purpose of SDRs**: Using structured routes to detect surveillance through controlled observation points, directional changes, and irregular movement patterns.
     - **Basic SDR Techniques**:
       - **Loopbacks**: Reversing direction unexpectedly to observe if anyone follows.
       - **Zig-Zagging**: Crossing streets multiple times at varied intervals to observe pursuers.
       - **Timed Pauses**: Stopping at irregular intervals to check surroundings without alerting potential followers.
   - **Exercise**: Practicing Basic SDR Movements – In a simulated urban environment, trainees practice loopbacks, directional changes, and timed pauses, observed by instructors acting as surveillance.

3. **Visual Memory and Surveillance Detection Skills**
   - **Content**:
     - **Building Visual Memory**: Techniques to remember faces, clothing, and distinctive features over short periods without direct observation.
     - **Environmental Awareness**: Techniques for quickly scanning surroundings and mentally recording details in a way that appears natural.
   - **Exercise**: Observation Drill – Trainees are shown a group of people in a controlled setting, instructed to identify and remember key characteristics (clothing, behavior, accessories) within a brief window of time.
   - **Skills Practiced**: Memory reinforcement, detail orientation, and passive scanning techniques.
