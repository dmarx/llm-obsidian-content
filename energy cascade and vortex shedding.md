relate the energy cascade to vortex shedding

### Energy Cascade and Vortex Shedding

**Vortex shedding** and the **energy cascade** are both fundamental concepts in fluid dynamics, particularly in the study of turbulence. While they describe different aspects of fluid behavior, they are interrelated in the context of how energy is distributed and dissipated in a flow.

### Vortex Shedding

**Vortex shedding** occurs when a fluid flows past a bluff body (such as a cylinder or a sphere), leading to the periodic formation and release of vortices from alternate sides of the body. This process creates a pattern known as a **K치rm치n vortex street**, which is a regular array of vortices downstream of the body.

1. **Flow Instability**:
   - **Flow Separation**: As fluid flows over a bluff body, the boundary layer separates from the surface of the object due to adverse pressure gradients. This separation causes the formation of vortices.
   - **Periodic Shedding**: The vortices are shed alternately from either side of the object, resulting in an oscillatory [[wake]]. The frequency of vortex shedding is characterized by the Strouhal number \( \text{St} = \frac{fL}{U} \), where \( f \) is the shedding frequency, \( L \) is a characteristic length (such as the diameter of the cylinder), and \( U \) is the free-stream velocity.

2. **Energy in Vortex Shedding**:
   - **Energy Transfer**: Vortex shedding is a mechanism by which energy is transferred from the mean flow (the steady flow around the body) to unsteady, oscillatory motions. This energy transfer leads to the formation of coherent structures (vortices) in the [[wake]].
   - **Vortex Dynamics**: The energy contained in the shed vortices can further influence the flow downstream, contributing to turbulence and the energy cascade, especially if the Reynolds number is high enough for the flow to transition to turbulence.

### Energy Cascade in Turbulence

The **energy cascade** describes the process by which kinetic energy is transferred from large-scale motions to smaller and smaller scales within a turbulent flow, ultimately leading to energy dissipation at the smallest scales (Kolmogorov scales).

1. **Large-Scale Energy Injection**:
   - **Source of Energy**: In a turbulent flow, energy is typically introduced at large scales, such as through the motion of a large object, like a bluff body in vortex shedding, or through large-scale instabilities in the flow.
   - **Cascade Process**: The energy injected into the flow is transferred to smaller scales through the inertial range of the energy cascade, where inertial forces dominate and viscosity is negligible.

2. **Interaction with Vortex Shedding**:
   - **Vortex Formation as Large-Scale Structures**: The vortices generated by vortex shedding represent large-scale, coherent structures that carry a significant amount of kinetic energy. These vortices are part of the energy input into the turbulent flow and can initiate the energy cascade.
   - **Breaking Down of Vortices**: As these large-scale vortices interact with the surrounding flow, they can become unstable and break down into smaller vortices and eddies. This breakdown process is part of the energy cascade, where energy is transferred from large, coherent vortices to smaller, more chaotic structures.

3. **Turbulent Wake and the Cascade**:
   - **Turbulent Wake Development**: In the [[wake]] of a bluff body, the initial vortex shedding can lead to the development of a turbulent [[wake]], especially at higher Reynolds numbers. The energy in the shed vortices cascades to smaller scales, contributing to the overall turbulence.
   - **Energy Dissipation**: The energy cascade continues until the energy reaches the Kolmogorov scales, where it is dissipated as heat due to viscosity. The process of vortex shedding thus feeds into the broader dynamics of the energy cascade in turbulent flows.

### Linking Vortex Shedding and the Energy Cascade

**Vortex shedding** can be seen as an initial stage in the energy cascade in certain flows, particularly in the [[wake]] of bluff bodies:

1. **Initiation of the Cascade**:
   - Vortex shedding generates large-scale coherent structures that contain a significant portion of the flow's kinetic energy. These structures can then interact with the surrounding flow and break down, initiating the energy cascade that transfers energy to smaller scales.

2. **Contributing to Turbulence**:
   - In flows where vortex shedding leads to a turbulent [[wake]], the energy contained in the shed vortices contributes to the turbulence. The breakdown of these vortices feeds energy into the smaller scales of the turbulence, supporting the cascade process.

3. **Oscillatory Energy Transfer**:
   - The periodic nature of vortex shedding leads to oscillatory energy transfer between the mean flow and the vortex structures. As these vortices break down, the energy cascade distributes this energy across a wide range of scales, eventually leading to dissipation at the smallest scales.

### Example: Cylinder in Crossflow

Consider a cylinder placed in a crossflow:

1. **Vortex Shedding and Energy Injection**:
   - As fluid flows past the cylinder, vortices are shed alternately from either side of the cylinder, creating a K치rm치n vortex street. The energy associated with these vortices represents the energy injected into the [[wake]].

2. **Development of a Turbulent Wake**:
   - At high Reynolds numbers, the [[wake]] behind the cylinder becomes turbulent. The energy in the shed vortices is transferred to smaller scales through the energy cascade, leading to a fully turbulent [[wake]] with a broad range of interacting eddies.

3. **Energy Dissipation**:
   - As the turbulent energy cascades down to smaller and smaller scales, it is eventually dissipated as heat at the Kolmogorov scales. The entire process, from vortex shedding to energy dissipation, exemplifies the connection between vortex shedding and the energy cascade in turbulence.

### Conclusion

**Vortex shedding** and the **energy cascade** are closely linked in turbulent flows, especially in the context of wakes behind bluff bodies. Vortex shedding generates large-scale structures that contribute to the initial stages of the energy cascade, transferring energy from coherent vortices to smaller, more chaotic motions. As these structures break down, they feed energy into the turbulent flow, sustaining the cascade down to the smallest scales where dissipation occurs. Understanding this relationship is crucial for analyzing and predicting the behavior of turbulent wakes and their impact on engineering systems, environmental flows, and natural phenomena.
