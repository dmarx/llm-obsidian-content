### Potential Function and Fisher Information Metric

In the context of information geometry, the concept of a potential function $\psi$ is pivotal for understanding the geometric structure of statistical models, particularly for binary choice models like the logit model. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the geometric intuition:

#### Potential Function $\psi$

1. **Definition**:
   - The potential function $\psi$ is a scalar function from which the Fisher information metric can be derived. It encapsulates the essence of the probability distribution's geometry in parameter space.
   - For a given parameter vector $\theta$, the potential function $\psi(\theta)$ plays a central role in defining the geometry of the manifold.

2. **Role in Dually Flat Manifolds**:
   - In a dually flat manifold, the potential function $\psi(\theta)$ and its Legendre dual $\psi^*(\eta)$ provide a natural framework for the dual coordinate systems (primal coordinates $\theta$ and dual coordinates $\eta$).
   - These functions satisfy the Legendre transformation:
     $$
     \eta_i = \frac{\partial \psi(\theta)}{\partial \theta_i}, \quad \theta_i = \frac{\partial \psi^*(\eta)}{\partial \eta_i}
     $$
   - The Hessian of $\psi(\theta)$ gives the Fisher information metric.

#### Fisher Information Metric

1. **Definition**:
   - The Fisher information metric $g$ is a Riemannian metric that quantifies the amount of information that a random variable carries about an unknown parameter.
   - For a parameter vector $\theta$, the Fisher information matrix $I(\theta)$ is given by:
     $$
     I(\theta) = E \left[ \left( \frac{\partial \log P(y|x,\theta)}{\partial \theta} \right) \left( \frac{\partial \log P(y|x,\theta)}{\partial \theta} \right)^T \right]
     $$

2. **Metric as the Hessian**:
   - The Fisher information metric $g_{ij}(\theta)$ is obtained as the Hessian of the potential function $\psi(\theta)$:
     $$
     g_{ij}(\theta) = \frac{\partial^2 \psi(\theta)}{\partial \theta_i \partial \theta_j}
     $$
   - This relationship implies that the Fisher information metric is a second-order derivative of the potential function, capturing the curvature of the manifold in the parameter space.

#### Application to Binary Choice Models

1. **Logit Model**:
   - In the logit model, the choice probability is given by the logistic function:
     $$
     P(y = 1 | x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\beta^T x}}
     $$
   - The parameter vector $\beta$ corresponds to the primal coordinates $\theta$.
   - The potential function $\psi(\beta)$ can be interpreted as the log-partition function of the logistic distribution.

2. **Fisher Information for the Logit Model**:
   - The Fisher information matrix for the logit model can be derived as the Hessian of the potential function $\psi(\beta)$:
     $$
     g_{ij}(\beta) = \frac{\partial^2 \psi(\beta)}{\partial \beta_i \partial \beta_j}
     $$
   - The specific form of $\psi(\beta)$ ensures that the Fisher information metric aligns with the curvature of the logistic distribution.

### Geometric Intuition

1. **Flatness and Curvature**:
   - The manifold being dually flat means it is flat with respect to the Fisher information metric. The curvature tensor is zero, indicating no intrinsic curvature in the parameter space.

2. **Affine Coordinates and Geodesics**:
   - The affine coordinate systems ($\theta$ and $\eta$) simplify the representation of geodesics, which are straight lines in these coordinates. This flatness makes the geometry analogous to a Euclidean space in terms of information measures.

3. **Equivalence of Divergences**:
   - The equivalence of the canonical divergence and KL divergence in the logit model reflects the special structure of the potential function and the associated Fisher information metric.
   - This equivalence simplifies the interpretation and computation of divergence measures in the logit model, providing clear geometric and statistical insights.

### Conclusion

The potential function $\psi$ and its relationship with the Fisher information metric are foundational in understanding the geometric structure of binary choice models, particularly the logit model. This framework allows for a deep geometric intuition, illustrating why certain models possess desirable properties and simplifying many aspects of statistical analysis and inference.
