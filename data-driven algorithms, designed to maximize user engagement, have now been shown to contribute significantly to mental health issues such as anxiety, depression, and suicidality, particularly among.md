> Data-driven algorithms, designed to maximize user engagement, have now been shown to contribute significantly to mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, and suicidality, particularly among adolescents and young adults.

Certainly! Here is a list of real, published research studies that provide empirical evidence for the impact of data-driven algorithms on mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, and suicidality, particularly among adolescents and young adults:

1. **Twenge, J. M., Joiner, T. E., Rogers, M. L., & Martin, G. N. (2018). Increases in depressive symptoms, suicide-related outcomes, and suicide rates among U.S. adolescents after 2010 and links to increased new media screen time. _Clinical Psychological Science_, 6(1), 3-17.**
   - This study investigates the correlation between increased screen time and rising rates of depression and suicidality among adolescents. It provides a detailed analysis of how new media, especially social media, correlates with mental health issues in youth following the rise in digital engagement.

2. **Lin, L. Y., Sidani, J. E., Shensa, A., Radovic, A., Miller, E., Colditz, J. B., Hoffman, B. L., Giles, L. M., & Primack, B. A. (2016). Association between social media use and depression among U.S. young adults. _Depression and Anxiety_, 33(4), 323-331.**
   - This research assesses the association between social media use and depression in young adults in the U.S. It highlights the relationship between the duration and frequency of social media use and increased symptoms of depression.

3. **Woods, H. C., & Scott, H. (2016). #Sleepyteens: Social media use in adolescence is associated with poor sleep quality, anxiety, depression and low self-esteem. _Journal of Adolescence_, 51, 41-49.**
   - This paper explores how nighttime social media use impacts sleep quality, mood, and self-esteem among adolescents. The findings suggest a significant link between heavy social media engagement at night and increased levels of anxiety and depression.

4. **Hunt, M. G., Marx, R., Lipson, C., & Young, J. (2018). No More FOMO: Limiting Social Media Decreases Loneliness and Depression. _Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology_, 37(10), 751-768.**
   - This study conducts an experimental intervention to reduce social media use and examines its effects on feelings of loneliness and depression. It found that decreasing social media engagement significantly reduced depressive symptoms and feelings of loneliness among participants.

5. **Kelly, Y., Zilanawala, A., Booker, C., & Sacker, A. (2018). Social media use and adolescent mental health: Findings from the UK Millennium Cohort Study. _EClinicalMedicine_, 6, 59-68.**
   - This cohort study investigates the link between social media use and mental health in adolescents. It reports that heavy social media use is associated with poorer mental health outcomes and higher levels of psychological distress.

These studies collectively underline the growing concern about the impacts of digital engagement, driven by algorithms, on the mental health of adolescents and young adults. They provide a solid scientific foundation for advocating regulatory measures to mitigate these effects.
