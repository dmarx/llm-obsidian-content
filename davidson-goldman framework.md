# The Davidson-Goldman Framework

The [[Davidson-Goldman Framework]] represents a foundational approach to action theory that combines Donald Davidson's causal theory of action with Alvin Goldman's theory of action individuation and level-generation. This framework provides a comprehensive account of the nature of action, its causes, and the relationships between different descriptions of the same action.

## Davidson's Causal Theory

### Core Thesis

Davidson's seminal work "Actions, Reasons, and Causes" (1963) established that actions are events caused by the agent's beliefs and desires (which together constitute reasons):

$$\text{Action}(e) \iff \exists r(r \text{ rationalizes } e \land r \text{ causes } e)$$

Where:
- $e$ is an event
- $r$ is a reason (a belief-desire pair)

### Primary Reasons

Davidson introduced the concept of a [[primary reason]], which consists of:

1. A [[pro-attitude]] toward actions with a certain property
2. A [[belief]] that the action in question has that property

Formally:

$$\text{PrimaryReason}(r, a) \iff \exists\phi[\text{ProAttitude}(a, \phi) \land \text{Belief}(a, \text{HasProperty}(a, \phi))]$$

### Anomalous Monism

Davidson's broader philosophy includes [[anomalous monism]], which holds that:

1. Mental events causally interact with physical events
2. Events that causally interact must fall under strict laws
3. There are no strict psychophysical laws

This creates the framework for understanding mental causation without reducing the mental to the physical.

## Goldman's Theory of Action Individuation

### Fine-Grained Individuation

Goldman argued for a fine-grained approach to individuating actions in "A Theory of Human Action" (1970). Unlike Davidson's coarse-grained view (where flipping the switch and turning on the light are the same action under different descriptions), Goldman maintained that these are distinct but related actions:

$$a_1 \neq a_2 \text{ if } \exists P(P(a_1) \land \neg P(a_2))$$

### Level-Generation

Goldman introduced the concept of [[level-generation]] to explain the relationship between these distinct actions:

$$a \text{ level-generates } a' \iff \exists R(R(a, a'))$$

Where $R$ is one of four generation relations:

1. **Causal generation**: Action $a$ causes some event that makes $a'$ an action
   $$\text{CausalGen}(a, a') \iff \text{Effects}(a) \text{ make } a' \text{ the case}$$

2. **Conventional generation**: Action $a$ counts as doing $a'$ by convention
   $$\text{ConventionalGen}(a, a') \iff \exists C(C \text{ is a convention } \land C(a) = a')$$

3. **Simple generation**: Action $a$ constitutes doing $a'$ in the circumstances
   $$\text{SimpleGen}(a, a') \iff \exists c(c \text{ are circumstances } \land \text{In}(c, a \to a'))$$

4. **Augmentation generation**: Action $a$ is doing $a'$ with some added feature
   $$\text{AugmentationGen}(a, a') \iff a' = a + f$$

## Integration of the Two Approaches

The Davidson-Goldman Framework combines these elements:

1. Davidson's account of what makes something an action (mental causation)
2. Goldman's account of how actions relate to one another (level-generation)

This integration provides:

$$\text{Action}(e) \iff \exists r, a_0(r \text{ causes } a_0 \land a_0 \text{ is basic} \land (a_0 = e \lor a_0 \text{ level-generates } e))$$

## Basic Actions

Both theorists engage with the concept of [[basic actions]]:

- Davidson sees basic actions as those not done by doing something else
- Goldman defines them as actions not generated by any other actions

Formally:

$$\text{Basic}(a) \iff \neg\exists b(b \text{ generates } a)$$

These basic actions serve as the foundation for the generation of all other actions.

## Action Explanation

The framework provides a model for explaining actions:

$$\text{Explains}(r, a) \iff r \text{ causes } a \land r \text{ rationalizes } a$$

Where rationalization involves showing how the action makes sense given the agent's beliefs and desires:

$$\text{Rationalizes}(r, a) \iff \text{InLightOf}(r, a \text{ is reasonable})$$

## Intentional vs. Unintentional Action

The framework distinguishes intentional from unintentional actions:

$$\text{Intentional}(a) \iff \exists i(i \text{ is an intention } \land i \text{ appropriately causes } a)$$

$$\text{Unintentional}(a) \iff \text{Action}(a) \land \neg\text{Intentional}(a)$$

Davidson famously argued that an action may be intentional under one description but not under another:

$$\text{IntentionalUnder}(a, d_1) \land \neg\text{IntentionalUnder}(a, d_2)$$

## Philosophical Challenges

### The Logical Connection Argument

The [[logical connection argument]] challenges the causal theory by claiming that reasons cannot be causes because the relationship between reasons and actions is logical rather than causal:

$$\text{LogicallyConnected}(r, a) \stackrel{?}{\implies} \neg\text{CausallyConnected}(r, a)$$

Davidson countered this by arguing that the logical connection is between descriptions, while the causal connection is between events.

### The Deviant Causal Chain Problem

The [[deviant causal chain problem]] arises when the right mental states cause the right bodily movements but in the "wrong way":

$$\text{DeviantCausalChain}(r, a) \iff r \text{ causes } a \land \neg\text{AppropriatelyCauses}(r, a)$$

Neither Davidson nor Goldman fully resolved this problem, which remains a significant challenge.

## Contemporary Extensions

### Causation and Time

Recent work extends the framework to address temporal aspects:

$$\text{DistalIntention}(i, t_1) \xrightarrow{c} \text{ProximalIntention}(i', t_2) \xrightarrow{c} \text{Action}(a, t_3)$$

Where $t_1 < t_2 < t_3$ and $i$ is related to $i'$ through reasoning and memory.

### Mental Causation

The problem of [[mental causation]] remains central:

$$\text{Mental}(m) \land \text{Physical}(p) \land m \neq p \land m \xrightarrow{c} p$$

How can mental states cause physical movements without violating physical causal closure?

## Applications

### Moral Theory

The framework has implications for moral theory, particularly regarding the distinction between:

$$\text{DoingHarm}(a) \text{ vs. } \text{AllowingHarm}(a)$$

And for understanding the role of intention in moral evaluation:

$$\text{MoralWorth}(a) = f(\text{Intention}(a), \text{Consequences}(a))$$

### Philosophy of Mind

The framework connects to broader issues in philosophy of mind:

$$\text{Mental}(m) \xrightarrow{c} \text{Physical}(p) \xrightarrow{c} \text{World}(w)$$

This causal chain is essential for understanding how minds can interact with and change the world.

## Research Frontiers

Current research explores:
- Integration with [[predictive processing]] models
- Connections to [[embodied cognition]]
- The role of [[automaticity]] and [[habit]] in action
- Implications for [[collective agency]]
- Applications to [[artificial intelligence]] and robotics
