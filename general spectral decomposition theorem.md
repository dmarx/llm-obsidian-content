# General Spectral Decomposition Theorem

The [[General Spectral Decomposition Theorem]] provides a fundamental result in [[functional analysis]] that unifies various decomposition techniques across mathematics. It establishes conditions under which operators can be represented as convergent series of simpler operators.

## Formal Statement

Let H be a [[separable Hilbert space]] and T: H → H be a [[compact self-adjoint operator]]. Then there exists:

1. A countable orthonormal sequence {φₙ} of [[eigenvectors]] of T
2. A corresponding sequence of real [[eigenvalues]] {λₙ} converging to 0
3. A decomposition:

T = ∑ₙ λₙ Pₙ

where Pₙ is the [[orthogonal projection]] onto the eigenspace corresponding to λₙ.

## Key Properties

### Spectral Resolution
For any x ∈ H:
```
Tx = ∑ₙ λₙ ⟨x,φₙ⟩ φₙ
```
where ⟨·,·⟩ denotes the [[inner product]] on H.

### Convergence
The series converges in the [[operator norm]]:
```
||T - ∑ₖ₌₁ᴺ λₖ Pₖ|| → 0 as N → ∞
```

### Completeness
The eigenvectors {φₙ} form a complete orthonormal system in H, meaning:
```
x = ∑ₙ ⟨x,φₙ⟩ φₙ  for all x ∈ H
```

## Extensions

### Non-Self-Adjoint Case
For a general compact operator T (not necessarily self-adjoint), we have the [[Singular Value Decomposition]]:
```
T = ∑ₙ σₙ |uₙ⟩⟨vₙ|
```
where:
- σₙ are the [[singular values]] (non-negative real numbers)
- uₙ are the left singular vectors
- vₙ are the right singular vectors

### Unbounded Operators
For [[unbounded self-adjoint operators]], we have the [[Spectral Theorem]]:
```
T = ∫ λ dE(λ)
```
where E(λ) is the [[spectral measure]] associated with T.

## Applications

1. [[Quantum Mechanics]]: Representation of observables and their measurement spectra
2. [[Signal Processing]]: Fourier and wavelet transforms
3. [[Data Analysis]]: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
4. [[Differential Equations]]: Solution of boundary value problems

## Relationship to Other Concepts

The theorem connects to:
- [[Peter-Weyl Theorem]] for compact groups
- [[Stone's Theorem]] for one-parameter unitary groups
- [[Mercer's Theorem]] for integral operators
- [[Sturm-Liouville Theory]] for differential operators

## Mathematical Prerequisites

Understanding requires familiarity with:
- [[Hilbert Space Theory]]
- [[Operator Theory]]
- [[Measure Theory]]
- [[Functional Analysis]]

The theorem represents a cornerstone of modern analysis, providing a bridge between finite-dimensional linear algebra and infinite-dimensional operator theory.
