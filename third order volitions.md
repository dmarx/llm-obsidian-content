third order volitions


**ASSISTANT**

**Third-order volitions** would extend Harry Frankfurt's hierarchical model of desires and volitions one step further, representing a **reflection on second-order volitions**. While Frankfurt’s original model primarily focuses on **first-order desires** (basic urges) and **second-order volitions** (reflective endorsement of desires that should govern our actions), **third-order volitions** would involve reflecting on whether one’s **second-order volitions** are in line with their deeper values, identity, or long-term goals.

Although Frankfurt doesn’t explicitly develop the idea of third-order volitions, expanding his framework in this way could offer a more nuanced understanding of **higher-level autonomy** and **moral self-reflection**.

### 1. **First-Order Desires and Second-Order Volitions: A Recap**

To understand third-order volitions, let’s briefly recap Frankfurt’s core ideas:
- **First-order desires** are the basic urges or wants that move us to act (e.g., the desire to eat, sleep, or engage in addictive behavior).
- **Second-order desires** are desires about first-order desires (e.g., the desire to not want to smoke).
- **Second-order volitions** are a special type of second-order desire: they are desires that a particular first-order desire should be the one that governs your actions (e.g., “I want my desire to quit smoking to guide my behavior”).

Having **free will**, in Frankfurt’s view, means that our **first-order desires** align with our **second-order volitions**—we are free when we act in accordance with the desires that we reflectively endorse as our own.

### 2. **What Are Third-Order Volitions?**

**Third-order volitions** would involve a higher level of self-reflection, where one reflects not just on which **first-order desires** they want to act upon but on **whether their second-order volitions are in line with their overall values or identity**. In other words, third-order volitions involve evaluating whether the process by which we endorse or reject certain desires (second-order volitions) itself aligns with our deeper understanding of who we are or want to become.

#### **Definition**:  
A **third-order volition** is a reflective stance about one's **second-order volitions**. It is the desire that one’s reflective evaluations of their desires (second-order volitions) should align with their **higher values, identity, or life goals**.

- **Example**: 
  - A person might have a **first-order desire** to engage in impulsive shopping.
  - They might have a **second-order volition** to resist this impulse because they want to be financially responsible.
  - But at a higher level, they might have a **third-order volition** where they reflect on whether their desire for financial responsibility is aligned with their **deepest values**—such as living a minimalist lifestyle, contributing to charity, or focusing on sustainability. They might then question whether their second-order volition (financial responsibility) is the right priority in the context of their broader sense of self.

### 3. **Applications and Examples of Third-Order Volitions**

#### **1. Self-Reflection and Identity**
Third-order volitions provide a space for individuals to reflect not just on their immediate choices but on the **process of decision-making** itself in light of **who they are** or **who they want to become**. For example:
- **Career Choices**: 
  - An individual might have a **first-order desire** to pursue a high-paying job.
  - Their **second-order volition** might be to endorse this desire because it aligns with their desire for success.
  - But at the **third-order level**, they might reflect on whether the desire for success aligns with their **broader identity or life goals**—perhaps realizing that they value work-life balance, personal fulfillment, or social impact more than monetary success. In this case, the person might re-evaluate their second-order volition in light of their higher-order reflections.

#### **2. Addiction Recovery**
Third-order volitions might also play a crucial role in the **recovery from addiction** or compulsive behaviors, where individuals must reflect on **why they want to change** and whether their second-order volitions align with their **deeper sense of self**.
- **Example**: 
  - A person struggling with substance abuse may have a **first-order desire** to use drugs.
  - Their **second-order volition** might be to stop using drugs because they want to avoid harm.
  - But their **third-order volition** might involve reflecting on whether their second-order desire to quit drugs aligns with their **higher values**, such as becoming a role model for their children, fulfilling spiritual commitments, or rebuilding their life in a way that reflects their true potential.

By reflecting on third-order volitions, they might strengthen their **commitment to recovery**, seeing it not just as a response to external pressures (e.g., avoiding harm) but as a way to live in alignment with their core identity.

#### **3. Moral Integrity and Ethical Reflection**
In the realm of **ethics**, third-order volitions could involve reflecting on whether your second-order volitions align with your **moral framework**. This deeper reflection could shape your actions in important ways.
- **Example**:
  - A person might have a **first-order desire** to lie to avoid trouble.
  - They might have a **second-order volition** to refrain from lying because they value honesty.
  - At the **third-order level**, they might reflect on whether their commitment to honesty is rooted in a deep sense of **moral integrity**, an ethical framework (such as Kantian duty ethics or utilitarianism), or a religious belief system. By examining their higher-level volitions, they can ensure that their second-order volitions reflect their **most fundamental moral principles**.

### 4. **Third-Order Volitions and Free Will**

Just as **second-order volitions** are essential for **Frankfurt’s conception of free will**, **third-order volitions** could be seen as necessary for a **higher level of autonomy** or **authentic selfhood**. While second-order volitions allow us to decide which first-order desires should govern our actions, third-order volitions allow us to reflect on the **framework of values** and **identity** that guide those decisions.

- **Deep Autonomy**: An individual can be said to have a **deeper form of autonomy** when their second-order volitions (the desires they want to act on) are themselves aligned with their **third-order volitions**, which reflect their highest values, life goals, or moral framework. This higher-order reflection ensures that their actions are not just impulsive but are fully integrated with their **sense of self**.

- **Authenticity and Personal Growth**: Third-order volitions are essential for **personal growth** and **authentic living**. They allow individuals to not only reflect on their current desires but to critically examine whether their **life trajectory** is in line with their **core values**. This could involve reassessing priorities or making major life changes when someone realizes their second-order volitions are not aligned with their deepest self-understanding.

### 5. **Moral Responsibility and Third-Order Volitions**

In terms of **moral responsibility**, third-order volitions could add another layer of reflection about **accountability**:
- **Deeper Responsibility**: A person who acts in alignment with their third-order volitions demonstrates a deeper level of moral responsibility because their actions reflect a considered and coherent set of **values and principles**. If their actions are based on desires that align with their **highest sense of self**, they are more fully **responsible** for those actions.
- **Responsibility and Maturity**: The presence of third-order volitions could also be linked to **maturity** in decision-making. A person who reflects on their second-order volitions in the context of their long-term goals and identity might be seen as **more responsible** than someone who acts based on unexamined second-order volitions.

### 6. **Criticisms and Challenges**

While the concept of third-order volitions adds depth to Frankfurt’s model, it also presents some challenges:
- **Infinite Regress**: One major criticism of extending the hierarchy beyond second-order volitions is the potential for an **infinite regress**. If third-order volitions exist, could there be **fourth-order volitions**, **fifth-order volitions**, and so on? Where does the reflective process stop? While in practice, people typically stop reflecting at some level (often third-order reflection is sufficient), the regress problem remains a philosophical concern.
  
- **Over-Reflection**: Another challenge is the risk of **over-analysis**. Constantly reflecting on one’s desires, second-order volitions, and life goals could lead to **paralysis by analysis**, where individuals become stuck in indecision due to excessive self-scrutiny.

### Conclusion

**Third-order volitions** represent a higher level of self-reflection in which individuals reflect not only on their **desires** but also on whether their **process of endorsing certain desires** (second-order volitions) is in line with their **core values, identity, and long-term goals**. Extending Frankfurt’s model to include third-order volitions provides a richer understanding of **deep autonomy**, **personal integrity**, and **moral responsibility**.

While Harry Frankfurt’s original model of free will focuses on the alignment between **first-order desires** and **second-order volitions**, adding the concept of third-order volitions highlights the importance of reflecting on whether our **values and decision-making processes** themselves align with our overarching vision of the **kind of person we want to be**.
