geometric langlands conjecture


**ASSISTANT**

The Geometric Langlands Conjecture is a central topic in modern mathematics, situated at the crossroads of number theory, representation theory, and algebraic geometry. It is a geometric analog of the Langlands Program, which seeks deep connections between number theory and harmonic analysis. The Geometric Langlands Conjecture translates problems in representation theory into the language of algebraic geometry.

### Background and Context

The Langlands Program, initiated by Robert Langlands in the late 1960s, posits a series of conjectures and theorems connecting Galois groups in number theory to [[automorphic forms]] and representations of reductive algebraic groups. The Geometric Langlands Conjecture adapts these ideas to the realm of algebraic geometry, particularly over function fields.

### Function Fields and Curves

Consider a smooth projective curve $X$ over a finite field $k$. A key object of interest in the Geometric Langlands Program is the category of $\mathcal{D}$-modules on the moduli stack of $G$-bundles over $X$, where $G$ is a reductive algebraic group.

### $\mathcal{D}$-modules and Hecke Eigensheaves

A $\mathcal{D}$-module is a sheaf equipped with a compatible action of differential operators. The Geometric Langlands Conjecture asserts a correspondence between certain $\mathcal{D}$-modules and representations of the fundamental group of the curve $X$.

Specifically, let $\text{Bun}_G(X)$ denote the moduli stack of $G$-bundles over $X$. The conjecture involves the following components:

1. **Automorphic Side**: Consider $\mathcal{D}$-modules on $\text{Bun}_G(X)$. These are the geometric analogs of [[automorphic forms]].
2. **Galois Side**: Consider $\ell$-adic local systems on $X$ with structure group $^L G$, the Langlands dual group of $G$. These local systems are analogous to Galois representations.

The conjecture posits a correspondence:
$$
\{\text{Hecke eigensheaves on } \text{Bun}_G(X)\} \longleftrightarrow \{\text{Local systems on } X \text{ with structure group } ^L G\}.
$$

### Hecke Operators

The concept of Hecke operators in the geometric setting is crucial. These operators act on $\mathcal{D}$-modules, analogous to how classical Hecke operators act on [[automorphic forms]]. A Hecke eigensheaf is a $\mathcal{D}$-module that is an eigenobject for the action of Hecke operators.

### Formalization

To formalize, let $\mathcal{F}$ be a $\mathcal{D}$-module on $\text{Bun}_G(X)$. It is a Hecke eigensheaf if there exists a local system $\mathcal{E}$ on $X$ such that for any point $x \in X$ and any representation $V$ of $^L G$, the action of the Hecke operator $H_x^V$ on $\mathcal{F}$ is given by tensoring with $\mathcal{E}_x \otimes V$.

### Example: $G = GL_n$

For $G = GL_n$, the conjecture can be made more explicit. The moduli stack $\text{Bun}_{GL_n}(X)$ parametrizes vector bundles of rank $n$ over $X$. The Langlands correspondence in this case relates $\mathcal{D}$-modules on $\text{Bun}_{GL_n}(X)$ to rank $n$ local systems on $X$.

### Derived Category and Homological Aspects

Recent advances have extended the conjecture to derived categories and homological algebra. In this context, one considers derived $\mathcal{D}$-modules and derived categories of coherent sheaves. The correspondence is conjecturally an equivalence of derived categories:
$$
D(\mathcal{D}\text{-mod}(\text{Bun}_G(X))) \simeq D(\text{LocSys}_{^L G}(X)),
$$
where $D(\mathcal{D}\text{-mod}(\text{Bun}_G(X)))$ denotes the derived category of $\mathcal{D}$-modules on $\text{Bun}_G(X)$, and $D(\text{LocSys}_{^L G}(X))$ denotes the derived category of $^L G$-local systems on $X$.

### Conclusion

The Geometric Langlands Conjecture is a deep and profound connection between algebraic geometry, representation theory, and number theory. It provides a geometric framework for understanding the representation theory of reductive groups and has connections to mathematical physics, particularly in the study of [[quantum field theory]]. Understanding and proving aspects of this conjecture remains an active area of research with many open questions and significant implications across various fields of mathematics.
