**ASSISTANT**

The **German Criminal Code (Strafgesetzbuch, StGB)** contains several provisions aimed at restricting certain forms of speech and expression to protect public order, individual rights, and historical memory. These laws specifically address issues like **hate speech**, **defamation**, and the dissemination of **unconstitutional propaganda**, reflecting Germany's post-WWII commitment to preventing the spread of extremist ideologies and protecting [[human dignity]]. Several of these laws are central to the **Network Enforcement Act (NetzDG)**, which requires social media platforms to remove illegal content quickly.

### Key Sections of the German Criminal Code

#### 1. **Incitement to Hatred (§ 130 StGB)**

**§ 130 StGB** criminalizes **incitement to hatred** (Volksverhetzung) against groups or individuals based on race, religion, ethnicity, or nationality. The law prohibits speech or acts that may incite violence, hatred, or discrimination and includes specific provisions related to the denial or trivialization of historical atrocities, particularly the Holocaust.

- **Key provisions**:
  - **Incitement of hatred** against segments of the population or groups based on nationality, race, religion, or ethnic origin.
  - **Calling for violent or arbitrary measures** against these groups.
  - **Attacking [[human dignity]]** by insulting or defaming individuals or groups.
  - **Holocaust denial** or the denial of Nazi-era crimes, specifically criminalized under this section to prevent revisionism and protect historical truth.

- **Punishments**: Violations can lead to imprisonment ranging from **three months to five years**.

- **Application in NetzDG**: Platforms are required to remove content that violates § 130 StGB, particularly hate speech targeting specific groups or Holocaust denial.

#### 2. **Defamation and Insult (§§ 185–187 StGB)**

These sections of the StGB criminalize **defamation**, **insult**, and **slander** against individuals, protecting their personal dignity and reputation.

- **§ 185 StGB (Insult)**:
  - Criminalizes general insults (Beleidigung), which include verbal abuse, name-calling, or offensive gestures. This provision covers both public and private insults.
  - **Punishment**: Fines or imprisonment of up to **one year**.

- **§ 186 StGB (Defamation)**:
  - Criminalizes the **dissemination of factual claims** about someone that are **false** and damage their reputation. The key element is that the claim must be **unverifiable** or **provably false**.
  - **Punishment**: Imprisonment for up to **two years** or fines.

- **§ 187 StGB (Slander)**:
  - Similar to § 186, but applies to knowingly **false statements** made with the intention of damaging someone’s reputation.
  - **Punishment**: Imprisonment of up to **five years** or fines.

- **Application in NetzDG**: Social media platforms must remove defamatory or insulting content, including posts that insult individuals or damage reputations through false information.

#### 3. **Dissemination of Propaganda by Unconstitutional Organizations (§ 86 StGB)**

**§ 86 StGB** prohibits the **distribution of propaganda** from organizations that are considered **unconstitutional** or illegal under German law, such as neo-Nazi groups or other extremist organizations.

- **Key provisions**:
  - Bans the production, distribution, or public display of materials (such as leaflets, books, symbols, and flags) associated with **Nazi propaganda** or other organizations that have been banned for opposing the democratic constitutional order.
  - This also includes online dissemination through websites, social media posts, and other digital means.
  
- **Exemptions**:
  - Certain uses are exempt from this prohibition, such as for purposes of **research, teaching, art, or reporting on historical events**, provided there is no intention to promote unconstitutional ideologies.

- **Punishment**: Violations can result in imprisonment for up to **three years** or fines.

- **Application in NetzDG**: Platforms must remove propaganda that violates this section, particularly content related to Nazi symbolism or extremist ideologies.

#### 4. **Violent Content (§ 111 StGB)**

**§ 111 StGB** criminalizes the **public incitement to commit crimes**. This includes encouraging others to engage in violent or criminal acts, either verbally, in writing, or through digital means.

- **Key provisions**:
  - Prohibits any form of **encouragement or solicitation** of a criminal act, whether the criminal act is directed at individuals or the public at large.
  - This could include calls for violence against specific groups, encouraging terrorism, or incitement to riots or other forms of illegal action.

- **Punishment**: Individuals found guilty of incitement can face up to **five years of imprisonment**.

- **Application in NetzDG**: Platforms are required to remove content that encourages or incites violence, including calls for terrorism, violent protests, or attacks on individuals or institutions.

#### 5. **Holocaust Denial (§ 130 StGB)**

**§ 130 StGB** also includes specific provisions against **Holocaust denial**. This was added to Germany’s legal framework as a response to the spread of Nazi revisionism and to preserve the historical record of the atrocities committed during World War II.

- **Key provisions**:
  - Criminalizes the **denial**, **approval**, or **trivialization** of the Holocaust and other crimes committed under the Nazi regime.
  - Holocaust denial is considered a form of **incitement to hatred** and is prosecuted under the same section of the law that deals with hate speech.

- **Punishment**: Violations are punishable by imprisonment for up to **five years**.

- **Application in NetzDG**: Social media platforms are required to take down any content denying or minimizing the Holocaust, which is treated as a serious violation of German law.

### Impact of These Laws

Germany’s criminal code reflects a **zero-tolerance policy** toward hate speech, extremism, and the denial of historical facts like the Holocaust. These laws are particularly strict in comparison to countries with broader free speech protections, such as the United States, where the **First Amendment** shields most forms of speech, including some forms of hate speech.

These provisions have been central to the development of laws like **NetzDG**, which compels platforms to moderate content actively. Social media platforms operating in Germany must ensure compliance with these sections of the criminal code by swiftly removing any content that violates these laws or risk facing significant fines.

### Global Influence

Germany’s stringent approach to regulating harmful content has influenced other countries seeking to combat the spread of extremism and hate speech online. Laws like NetzDG and the underlying criminal code provisions have inspired similar legislation, particularly in Europe, where there is a greater willingness to **balance free speech with protections against harmful content**.
