# Post-normal Science

Post-normal science (PNS) represents a philosophical framework and methodological approach for addressing complex societal issues where facts are uncertain, values are in dispute, stakes are high, and decisions are urgent. Developed by [[Silvio Funtowicz]] and [[Jerome Ravetz]] in the 1990s, PNS expands beyond traditional scientific paradigms to accommodate the challenges of contemporary problems like [[climate change]], [[genetic engineering]], and [[pandemic management]].

## Theoretical Foundations

### Core Conditions

Post-normal science emerges when problems exhibit the following characteristics:

1. **[[Epistemic uncertainty]]**: Facts are uncertain or incomplete
2. **[[Value plurality]]**: Multiple legitimate value perspectives exist
3. **[[High stakes]]**: Significant consequences for various stakeholders
4. **[[Decision urgency]]**: Delay is not a viable option

These conditions can be formalized as a four-dimensional problem space:

$$\mathcal{P} = \{\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{s}, \mathbf{t}\}$$

Where:
- $\mathbf{u} \in [0,1]$ represents the degree of uncertainty
- $\mathbf{v} \in [0,1]$ represents the degree of value disputation
- $\mathbf{s} \in [0,1]$ represents the stakes involved
- $\mathbf{t} \in [0,1]$ represents the urgency of decision-making

A problem becomes increasingly "post-normal" as these parameters approach 1.

### Historical Context

PNS emerged as a response to limitations in:

1. **[[Normal science]]**: Kuhn's concept of puzzle-solving within established paradigms
2. **[[Professional consultancy]]**: Expert-driven problem-solving approaches
3. **[[Applied science]]**: The direct application of scientific knowledge to practical problems

## The Epistemological Framework

### Extended Peer Communities

Central to PNS is the concept of [[extended peer communities]] that include diverse stakeholders beyond traditional scientific experts. This can be represented as:

$$\mathcal{C} = \mathcal{S} \cup \mathcal{T} \cup \mathcal{P} \cup \mathcal{L}$$

Where:
- $\mathcal{S}$ represents scientific experts
- $\mathcal{T}$ represents technical practitioners
- $\mathcal{P}$ represents policy makers
- $\mathcal{L}$ represents laypeople affected by the issue

### Extended Facts

PNS incorporates [[extended facts]] beyond traditional scientific data, including:

1. **[[Anecdotal evidence]]**: Personal experiences and observations
2. **[[Local knowledge]]**: Context-specific expertise
3. **[[Traditional ecological knowledge]]**: Indigenous ways of knowing
4. **[[Ethical considerations]]**: Moral dimensions of problems
5. **[[Cultural narratives]]**: Collective meanings and stories

### Quality Assurance

PNS replaces traditional peer review with [[extended quality assurance]] characterized by:

1. The [[NUSAP system]] (Numeral, Unit, Spread, Assessment, Pedigree) for evaluating knowledge claims
2. [[Sensitivity analysis]] for understanding how conclusions depend on assumptions
3. [[Multi-criteria mapping]] for exploring diverse problem framings

## Mathematical Formalization

### Uncertainty Quantification

PNS distinguishes between different types of uncertainty:

1. **[[Technical uncertainty]]**: Measurable probabilities
2. **[[Methodological uncertainty]]**: Related to model choices
3. **[[Epistemological uncertainty]]**: Concerning knowledge gaps
4. **[[Ethical uncertainty]]**: About value judgments

These can be formalized as a nested hierarchy:

$$U_{\text{technical}} \subset U_{\text{methodological}} \subset U_{\text{epistemological}} \subset U_{\text{ethical}}$$

### The NUSAP System

The [[NUSAP framework]] evaluates knowledge claims with five dimensions:

1. **Numeral** ($N$): The quantitative value
2. **Unit** ($U$): The measurement standard
3. **Spread** ($S$): Statistical variation, expressible as:
   $$S = \{\sigma, CI, [min, max]\}$$
   Where $\sigma$ is standard deviation, $CI$ is confidence interval
4. **Assessment** ($A$): Qualitative evaluation, typically on a scale:
   $$A \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$$
   Where higher values indicate greater reliability
5. **Pedigree** ($P$): Multi-criteria evaluation of knowledge production:
   $$P = \{p_1, p_2, ..., p_n\}$$
   Where each $p_i$ represents criteria like theoretical foundation, methodological rigor, peer acceptance, etc.

### Value Mapping

PNS acknowledges multiple value perspectives, which can be represented as:

$$V = \{v_1, v_2, ..., v_n\}$$

Where each $v_i$ is a value perspective with its own utility function:

$$u_i: O \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$$

Where $O$ is the set of possible outcomes.

## Methodological Approaches

### Problem Framing

PNS emphasizes that problem framing is value-laden and politically significant. The space of possible problem framings can be represented as:

$$\mathcal{F} = \{f_1, f_2, ..., f_n\}$$

Where each framing $f_i$ determines:
- What counts as relevant knowledge
- Which stakeholders have legitimate interests
- What solutions are considered viable

### Dialogical Methods

Key methodologies include:

1. **[[Consensus conferences]]**: Structured dialogues between experts and citizens
2. **[[Scenario workshops]]**: Collaborative exploration of future possibilities
3. **[[Pedigree assessment]]**: Evaluating knowledge claims through multi-criteria analysis
4. **[[Participatory modeling]]**: Co-constructing models with diverse stakeholders

### Policy Tools

PNS advocates for policy approaches that acknowledge deep uncertainty:

1. **[[Precautionary principle]]**: Taking preventive action despite uncertainty when potential harm is severe
2. **[[Robust decision-making]]**: Favoring options that perform adequately across multiple scenarios
3. **[[Adaptive management]]**: Treating policies as experiments with continuous monitoring and adjustment

## Applications and Case Studies

PNS has been applied to numerous domains including:

1. **[[Climate science]]**: Addressing the complex interplay of scientific uncertainty and sociopolitical factors
2. **[[Ecosystem management]]**: Incorporating diverse knowledge systems in natural resource governance
3. **[[Risk assessment]]**: Expanding traditional probabilistic approaches to include qualitative dimensions
4. **[[Health policy]]**: Managing uncertainties in public health interventions
5. **[[Emerging technologies]]**: Governing innovations with unpredictable consequences

## Critiques and Limitations

### Epistemological Critiques

1. **[[Relativism concerns]]**: Questions about whether PNS leads to epistemological relativism
2. **[[Boundary problems]]**: Challenges in determining when normal science remains appropriate
3. **[[Scientific authority]]**: Tensions with traditional scientific norms and practices

### Practical Challenges

1. **[[Implementation difficulties]]**: Institutional barriers to extended participation
2. **[[Power asymmetries]]**: Persistent inequalities in participatory processes
3. **[[Efficiency concerns]]**: Questions about timeliness of decision-making
4. **[[Scale problems]]**: Challenges in applying PNS to global issues

## Future Directions

### Theoretical Developments

1. **[[Integration with systems thinking]]**: Combining PNS with complex systems approaches
2. **[[Global epistemology]]**: Addressing cross-cultural dimensions of knowledge production
3. **[[Digital democracy]]**: Leveraging technology for extended participation

### Emerging Applications

1. **[[Artificial intelligence governance]]**: Managing uncertainties in autonomous systems
2. **[[Synthetic biology]]**: Addressing novel ethical questions in genetic engineering
3. **[[Sustainability transitions]]**: Navigating complex socio-technical changes

## Mathematical Representation of PNS Decision Processes

A formalization of PNS decision-making can be represented as a tuple:

$$\langle \Omega, \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{S}, \mathcal{V}, \mathcal{U}, D \rangle$$

Where:
- $\Omega$ is the set of possible states of the world
- $\mathcal{A}$ is the set of available actions
- $\mathcal{S}$ is the set of stakeholders
- $\mathcal{V}$ is the set of values held by stakeholders
- $\mathcal{U}$ is the set of utility functions mapping actions and states to outcomes for stakeholders
- $D$ is a decision function that aggregates stakeholder preferences under conditions of uncertainty

Unlike traditional decision theory, PNS acknowledges that $\Omega$, $\mathcal{A}$, $\mathcal{S}$, and $\mathcal{V}$ are themselves contested and subject to framing effects, creating a meta-decision problem about how to structure the decision itself.
