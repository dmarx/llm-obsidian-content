# Causal Theory of Agency

The [[Causal Theory of Agency]] (CTA) provides a framework for understanding the relationship between agents and their actions by appealing to distinctive causal patterns. This theory attempts to distinguish events that are genuine [[actions]] from those that are mere [[happenings]] by examining the causal chain leading to the event.

## Formal Characterization

At its core, the Causal Theory of Agency holds that:

$$\text{Action}(e) \iff \exists a, m, r \text{ such that } (a \text{ is an agent} \land m \text{ is a mental state of } a \land r \text{ is a reason} \land m \xrightarrow{c} e)$$

Where:
- $e$ represents an event
- $a$ represents an agent
- $m$ represents a mental state (typically beliefs, desires, and intentions)
- $r$ represents a reason
- $\xrightarrow{c}$ represents the appropriate causal relation

## The Davidson-Goldman Framework

Donald Davidson's seminal work "Actions, Reasons, and Causes" (1963) established the modern foundation for causal theories. Davidson proposed that:

$$\text{Action}(e) \iff \exists b, d \text{ such that } ((b \text{ is a belief} \land d \text{ is a desire}) \land (b, d) \text{ rationalize } e \land (b, d) \xrightarrow{c} e)$$

Alvin Goldman further developed this view with a more fine-grained account of action types, proposing a level-generation relation:

$$a \text{ level-generates } a' \iff \exists f \text{ such that } a' = f(a)$$

Where $f$ is a function mapping basic actions to higher-level action descriptions.

## Psychological Components

### Primary Reason

A [[primary reason]] consists of a pro-attitude toward actions of a certain kind and a belief that the action in question is of that kind:

$$\text{PrimaryReason}(r, a) \iff \exists \phi, \psi (\text{ProAttitude}(r, \phi) \land \text{Belief}(r, \psi) \land \phi(a) \land \psi(a))$$

### Intention Formation

The causal chain typically involves intention formation:

$$\text{Belief}(p) \land \text{Desire}(q) \land \text{Belief}(p \rightarrow q) \xrightarrow{c} \text{Intention}(a) \xrightarrow{c} \text{Action}(a)$$

This captures the practical reasoning process that leads from beliefs and desires to intentional action.

## The Deviant Causal Chain Problem

A major challenge to the causal theory is the [[deviant causal chain]] problem. A deviant causal chain occurs when the appropriate mental states cause the intended bodily movement, but in the "wrong way":

$$\text{DeviantCausalChain}(m, e) \iff m \xrightarrow{c} e \land \neg \text{ActionProduction}(m, e)$$

For example, a climber might intend to let go of a rope to save a fellow climber, but this intention causes such nervousness that they inadvertently let go. The intended outcome occurs, but not in the way that would make it an action.

### Proposed Solutions

Various solutions to the deviant causal chain problem have been proposed:

1. **Guidance Theory**: The mental state must guide the behavior throughout its execution:
   
   $$\text{Action}(e) \iff \exists m (m \xrightarrow{c} e \land \text{Guides}(m, e))$$

2. **Non-Basic Action Theory**: Limit the causal theory to non-basic actions:
   
   $$\text{NonBasicAction}(a) \iff \exists b (\text{BasicAction}(b) \land a \text{ level-generated by } b)$$

3. **Tracking Theory**: The causal process must track the content of the intention:
   
   $$\text{Tracking}(i, e) \iff \forall t \in [t_i, t_e](\text{Progress}(e, t) \approx \text{Plan}(i, t))$$

## Control and Self-Determination

The causal theory emphasizes the agent's [[control]] over their actions:

$$\text{Control}(a, e) \iff \text{MentalStates}(a) \xrightarrow{c} e \land \text{ResponseSensitive}(e, \text{MentalStates}(a))$$

This control element distinguishes actions from mere bodily movements and connects to questions of [[autonomy]] and [[self-determination]].

## Agent Causation vs. Event Causation

The causal theory generally employs [[event causation]] rather than [[agent causation]]:

$$\text{EventCausation}: m \xrightarrow{c} e$$
$$\text{AgentCausation}: a \xrightarrow{c} e$$

While some philosophers (e.g., Roderick Chisholm, Timothy O'Connor) argue that irreducible agent causation is necessary for genuine agency, CTA proponents maintain that event causation involving the appropriate mental states is sufficient.

## Extensions and Applications

### Extended Causal Chains

The theory can be extended to account for [[long-term agency]] and [[distal intentions]]:

$$\text{DistalIntention}(i, a, t_1, t_2) \iff \text{Forms}(a, i, t_1) \land \text{Executes}(a, i, t_2) \land t_1 < t_2 \land \text{Persists}(i, [t_1, t_2])$$

### Mental Action

The theory can be applied to [[mental actions]] such as deliberation or calculation:

$$\text{MentalAction}(m) \iff \exists i (\text{Intention}(i) \land i \xrightarrow{c} m \land \text{Mental}(m))$$

## Philosophical Implications

### For Free Will

The causal theory has implications for debates about [[free will]] and [[determinism]]:

$$\text{FreeAction}(a) \stackrel{?}{\iff} \text{DeterminedByAgent'sMentalStates}(a)$$

This formula captures the compatibilist position that free actions are those determined by the agent's own mental states.

### For Moral Responsibility

Similarly, the theory connects to [[moral responsibility]]:

$$\text{MorallyResponsible}(a, e) \iff \text{RelevantMentalStates}(a) \xrightarrow{c} e \land \text{Aware}(a, \text{Consequences}(e))$$

## Critiques and Alternatives

### Non-Causal Theories

Non-causal theories reject the central claim that causation is necessary for action:

$$\text{Action}(e) \iff \text{AgentOrigin}(e) \land \neg \text{Necessary}(\text{Causation}(m, e))$$

### Teleological Theories

[[Teleological theories]] emphasize the goal-directedness of action rather than its causal history:

$$\text{Action}(e) \iff \exists g (\text{Goal}(g) \land \text{For-the-sake-of}(e, g))$$

### Knowledge-First Approaches

Some contemporary approaches prioritize knowledge over causation:

$$\text{IntentionalAction}(a) \iff \text{KnowsWhat}(\text{Agent}, a) \land \text{KnowsWhy}(\text{Agent}, a)$$

## Research Frontiers

Current research explores:
- Integration with [[predictive processing]] models
- Connections to [[embodied cognition]]
- Implications for [[artificial agency]]
- The role of [[unconscious processes]] in action causation
- Reconciliation with [[situated agency]] perspectives
