title: let's think through what a minimal collection of subreddits might look like
  to model a simple person, and then implement with simple python llm agents

**ASSISTANT**

The **central executive (/r/mods)** coordinates system-wide tasks and resolves conflicts between subreddits, mirroring how the brain allocates attention and resources across different types of cognitive tasks.

For **AI systems**, this framework can be adapted to handle complex information processing in a distributed, scalable manner, where **specialized modules** (subreddits) process domain-specific tasks and **global decision-making** emerges from the interaction between these modules.


**USER**

let's think through what a minimal collection of subreddits might look like to model a simple "person", and then implement with simple python llm agents


**ASSISTANT**

To model a simple "person" using subreddits in a **pub-sub architecture** (akin to the **Global Workspace Theory** combined with **Working Memory**), we'll need to define a minimal collection of cognitive subreddits that handle fundamental types of information processing. These subreddits will correspond to different cognitive modules and perform basic tasks like managing sensory input, processing language, coordinating attention, and making decisions.

### **Step 1: Define Minimal Collection of Subreddits for Cognitive Functions**

We'll break down a basic "person" into a few critical cognitive functions, each represented by a subreddit. These subreddits will interact via a publish-subscribe system and handle the basic workings of cognition, such as sensory input, memory, decision-making, and action.

#### **Core Subreddits**

1. **/r/all – Firehose (Sensory Input)**
   - **Function**: The unfiltered stream of raw data, representing all sensory input and external/internal stimuli.
   - **Posts**: Represent raw sensory data (e.g., visual, auditory, tactile information).
   - **Filter**: Only the most relevant information is allowed to pass through to other cognitive subreddits.

2. **/r/phonological_loop – Verbal Information Buffer**
   - **Function**: Holds and processes verbal/auditory information in working memory.
   - **Posts**: Represent short-term memory for words, phrases, and other language-related content (e.g., repeating instructions).
   - **Rehearsal**: Posts are repeated to keep them active, or they decay if not rehearsed.

3. **/r/visuospatial_sketchpad – Visual and Spatial Information Buffer**
   - **Function**: Holds and processes visual and spatial information (e.g., mental images, spatial layouts).
   - **Posts**: Represent images or mental maps (e.g., a picture of an object, the layout of a room).

4. **/r/episodic_buffer – Integrated Multi-Modal Content**
   - **Function**: Integrates verbal, visual, and other types of content into a coherent episode (e.g., remembering directions that combine visual and verbal data).
   - **Posts**: Represent integrated "episodes" that synthesize multiple types of information.

5. **/r/mods – Central Executive (Decision-Making)**
   - **Function**: Oversees cognitive processes and makes decisions about where to allocate attention and resources.
   - **Posts**: Represent system-wide tasks, such as directing attention to a specific subreddit (e.g., prioritizing the phonological loop during a conversation).

6. **/r/memory – Long-Term Memory Archive**
   - **Function**: Stores important information that can be recalled when needed.
   - **Posts**: Archived information from subreddits like **/r/phonological_loop** or **/r/visuospatial_sketchpad**, representing long-term memory.
   - **Search**: Information retrieval via a search function (i.e., recall).

7. **/r/action – Motor Control**
   - **Function**: Executes decisions and translates cognitive outputs into action.
   - **Posts**: Represent specific actions to be carried out (e.g., move forward, speak a phrase).

### **Step 2: Design Simple Python Agents to Simulate Subreddit Behavior**

We can implement these subreddits using **Python agents**. Each agent will represent a subreddit, handling posts and simulating cognitive processes like filtering, rehearsal, and decision-making. The agents will communicate via a basic pub-sub mechanism (e.g., using **queues** or **event loops**).

Here's a basic outline of the Python implementation:

#### **Step 2.1: Define the Subreddit Class**

Each **Subreddit** will be an agent that processes posts, applying filters or other cognitive operations.

```python
import queue
import random

class Subreddit:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.posts = queue.Queue()
        self.active = []  # Active posts (working memory)
        self.capacity = 5  # Max posts the subreddit can hold (capacity limit)
    
    def add_post(self, post):
        if len(self.active) < self.capacity:
            self.active.append(post)
            print(f"{self.name}: Post added to active memory: {post}")
        else:
            print(f"{self.name}: Capacity full. Post dropped: {post}")
    
    def clear_posts(self):
        print(f"{self.name}: Clearing active posts.")
        self.active = []

    def process(self):
        # Example process: simulate decaying memory or rehearsing
        if random.random() < 0.5:
            self.active = [post for post in self.active if random.random() < 0.7]
        if len(self.active) == 0:
            print(f"{self.name}: No active posts left, memory cleared.")
    
    def display(self):
        print(f"{self.name}: Active posts: {self.active}")
```

This simple **Subreddit** class has:
- A **queue** to hold incoming posts.
- A list of **active posts** representing short-term memory for that module.
- A **process()** method to simulate memory decay or processing, where posts may decay or remain active based on a random probability.
- A **capacity limit** for how many posts it can handle at once (to simulate working memory limits).

#### **Step 2.2: Define the Pub-Sub System**

We will now define the basic mechanism for posting to and subscribing between subreddits.

```python
class PubSubSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.subreddits = {}
    
    def add_subreddit(self, subreddit):
        self.subreddits[subreddit.name] = subreddit
    
    def post_to_subreddit(self, subreddit_name, post):
        if subreddit_name in self.subreddits:
            subreddit = self.subreddits[subreddit_name]
            subreddit.add_post(post)
        else:
            print(f"Subreddit {subreddit_name} not found!")
    
    def process_all(self):
        for subreddit in self.subreddits.values():
            subreddit.process()
    
    def display_all(self):
        for subreddit in self.subreddits.values():
            subreddit.display()
```

This **PubSubSystem** class manages multiple subreddits, allowing posts to be sent to individual subreddits and processing each one.

#### **Step 2.3: Create Subreddits and Simulate a Cognitive System**

Now, we instantiate the subreddits representing cognitive functions and simulate their behavior.

```python
# Instantiate the system
system = PubSubSystem()

# Create subreddits for key cognitive modules
phonological_loop = Subreddit("r/phonological_loop")
visuospatial_sketchpad = Subreddit("r/visuospatial_sketchpad")
episodic_buffer = Subreddit("r/episodic_buffer")
central_executive = Subreddit("r/mods")
long_term_memory = Subreddit("r/memory")
action_module = Subreddit("r/action")

# Add subreddits to the system
system.add_subreddit(phonological_loop)
system.add_subreddit(visuospatial_sketchpad)
system.add_subreddit(episodic_buffer)
system.add_subreddit(central_executive)
system.add_subreddit(long_term_memory)
system.add_subreddit(action_module)

# Simulate posting to subreddits
system.post_to_subreddit("r/phonological_loop", "Repeat 'go to the store'")
system.post_to_subreddit("r/visuospatial_sketchpad", "Visualize the layout of the store")
system.post_to_subreddit("r/episodic_buffer", "Integrating memory of store layout and instructions")
system.post_to_subreddit("r/mods", "Central Executive: prioritize navigation task")

# Simulate processing
system.process_all()

# Display the current state of each subreddit
system.display_all()
```

### **Step 3: Run and Expand the Model**

The above Python script creates a basic model of how the **/r/me** system might work:
- **Posts** simulate cognitive inputs, such as instructions or visualizations.
- Each subreddit processes posts based on its function (e.g., verbal, visual, integrated multi-modal content).
- The **central executive (/r/mods)** can coordinate across subreddits, shifting priorities based on system-wide tasks.
- Posts decay or are removed when they are no longer relevant, simulating short-term memory limits.

### **Next Steps for Expansion**
- **Search and Long-Term Memory**: Implement a **search function** in the **long-term memory** subreddit, allowing it to store and recall information from other subreddits.
- **Attention Mechanism**: Add a more complex attention model that controls which subreddits are prioritized based on current cognitive tasks (e.g., focus on /r/phonological_loop when processing language).
- **Learning**: Extend this model by adding feedback loops that allow subreddits to “learn” or adapt based on past posts (e.g., repeated actions increase retrieval speed).
- **Higher Complexity**: Create more subreddits for specialized tasks like emotional processing, abstract reasoning, and decision-making, reflecting more complex cognitive architectures.

This basic implementation simulates a minimal, pub-sub cognitive system with a few key working memory components, decision-making via the central executive, and sensory input filtering, providing a foundation for more complex cognitive simulations.
