**USER**

the Galilean Transformation


**ASSISTANT**

The **Galilean Transformation** is a set of equations used in classical mechanics to relate the coordinates and time between two reference frames that are in uniform relative motion. It provides a way to convert the position and velocity of a particle as observed from one inertial frame to another, assuming that the speed of light is infinite (or, equivalently, that time is absolute and universal across all reference frames). 

### 1. General Setup
Consider two inertial reference frames:
- Frame $S$: The "stationary" frame with coordinates $(x, y, z, t)$.
- Frame $S'$$: A second frame moving at a constant velocity $v$ along the $x$-axis relative to $S$. The coordinates in this frame are $(x', y', z', t')$.

We assume:
- The two frames share the same origin at $t = t' = 0$.
- The velocity $v$ is constant, meaning the relative acceleration between the two frames is zero.

### 2. Galilean Transformation Equations
Under the assumption of **absolute time** and no relativistic effects, the Galilean transformation from frame $S$ to $S'$ is given by:

\[
\begin{aligned}
    x' &= x - vt, \\
    y' &= y, \\
    z' &= z, \\
    t' &= t.
\end{aligned}
\]
  
### 3. Inverse Galilean Transformation
The inverse transformation (i.e., converting from $S'$ back to $S$) is straightforward, simply solving for the unprimed coordinates:

\[
\begin{aligned}
    x &= x' + vt', \\
    y &= y', \\
    z &= z', \\
    t &= t'.
\end{aligned}
\]

### 4. Implications of Galilean Transformations

- **Absolute Time**: Time is invariant under the Galilean transformation, meaning $t' = t$. This reflects the classical notion that all observers experience the same "universal" time, regardless of their relative motion.
  
- **Non-relativistic Limit**: The Galilean transformation assumes that velocities involved are much smaller than the speed of light, $c$. In fact, this transformation becomes inaccurate for objects moving at speeds comparable to $c$, where relativistic effects dominate. In such cases, the [[Lorentz Transformation]] replaces the Galilean transformation.

- **Velocity Transformation**: The velocities in the two frames are related by:
\[
v_x' = v_x - v, \quad v_y' = v_y, \quad v_z' = v_z.
\]
This shows that velocities simply subtract linearly along the direction of motion (in this case, the $x$-axis), while remaining unchanged in perpendicular directions.

### 5. Example
Suppose a particle is moving in frame $S$ with velocity components $v_x = 5 \, \text{m/s}$, $v_y = 2 \, \text{m/s}$, and $v_z = 0 \, \text{m/s}$. If the second frame $S'$ is moving with velocity $v = 3 \, \text{m/s}$ relative to $S$ in the $x$-direction, the velocity components in $S'$ are given by:
\[
v_x' = v_x - v = 5 - 3 = 2 \, \text{m/s}, \quad v_y' = 2 \, \text{m/s}, \quad v_z' = 0 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

Thus, the particle's velocity in $S'$ is $(2 \, \text{m/s}, 2 \, \text{m/s}, 0 \, \text{m/s})$.

### 6. Breakdown of Galilean Invariance
In the context of **Newtonian mechanics**, the Galilean transformation ensures that the laws of motion are invariant under transformations between inertial frames. For instance, Newton's second law, $F = ma$, retains the same form in both frames $S$ and $S'$.

However, when velocities approach the speed of light, the Galilean transformation breaks down because it doesn't account for the fact that time and space are interrelated at relativistic speeds. This discrepancy led to the development of the [[Special Theory of Relativity]], which replaces the Galilean transformations with the [[Lorentz Transformation]] to correctly describe spacetime in such regimes.

### 7. Formal Representation of Galilean Group
The **Galilean transformations** form a Lie group, known as the **Galilean group**. This group includes:
- Spatial translations.
- Temporal translations (shifts in time).
- Rotations in space.
- Boosts, which are the transformations between frames moving at constant velocity relative to each other (i.e., the transformations we've described above).

Each of these transformations can be represented by matrices that act on vectors in the four-dimensional space of coordinates $(x, y, z, t)$.

In summary, the Galilean transformation is fundamental to classical mechanics and describes how positions and velocities transform between inertial reference frames when relativistic effects are negligible. It rests on the assumption of absolute time and the independence of spatial coordinates from the observerâ€™s state of motion.
