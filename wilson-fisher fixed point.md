Wilson-Fisher Fixed Point


**ASSISTANT**

The Wilson-Fisher fixed point is a critical fixed point in the renormalization group (RG) analysis of phase transitions, particularly in systems described by the \(\phi^4\) [[scalar field theory]] in dimensions less than four. It is named after Kenneth Wilson and Michael Fisher, who developed the concept. This fixed point is crucial for understanding the universal behavior of second-order phase transitions in three dimensions.

## Overview

### \(\phi^4\) Theory

The \(\phi^4\) theory, also known as the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson model, is described by the following Lagrangian density (or Hamiltonian density in statistical mechanics):

$$
\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2} (\partial_\mu \phi)(\partial^\mu \phi) + \frac{1}{2} r \phi^2 + \frac{u}{4!} \phi^4
$$

where \(\phi\) is the scalar field, \(r\) is a parameter related to the temperature \(T\), and \(u\) is the coupling constant representing the strength of the \(\phi^4\) interaction.

### Renormalization Group and Fixed Points

In the RG approach, one studies how the parameters of the theory change as the system is observed at different length scales. The beta functions describe the flow of these parameters:

$$
\beta_r(r, u) = \mu \frac{d r}{d \mu}, \quad \beta_u(r, u) = \mu \frac{d u}{d \mu}
$$

A fixed point \((r^*, u^*)\) is defined by the conditions:

$$
\beta_r(r^*, u^*) = 0, \quad \beta_u(r^*, u^*) = 0
$$

### Wilson-Fisher Fixed Point

For \(\phi^4\) theory in dimensions \(d < 4\), the Wilson-Fisher fixed point is a non-trivial fixed point (i.e., \(u^* \neq 0\)). It describes the critical behavior of the system at the phase transition.

## Calculation and Dimensional Regularization

### Dimensional Regularization

Dimensional regularization is a technique used to handle divergences in quantum field theory calculations by working in \(d = 4 - \epsilon\) dimensions, where \(\epsilon\) is a small parameter. This approach allows the identification of the fixed points and the calculation of critical exponents.

### Beta Functions

To one-loop order, the beta functions for the \(\phi^4\) theory in \(d = 4 - \epsilon\) dimensions are:

$$
\beta_r(r, u) = -2r + \frac{u}{16\pi^2} (N+2) \frac{r}{\epsilon}
$$

$$
\beta_u(u) = -\epsilon u + \frac{3(N+8)}{16\pi^2} u^2
$$

where \(N\) is the number of components of the field \(\phi\).

### Fixed Points

The Gaussian fixed point corresponds to \(u^* = 0\) and \(r^* = 0\), describing the behavior of the system in the absence of interactions.

The Wilson-Fisher fixed point is obtained by solving \(\beta_u(u^*) = 0\):

$$
u^* = \frac{16\pi^2 \epsilon}{3(N+8)}
$$

For this fixed point, \(\beta_r(r^*, u^*) = 0\) is automatically satisfied since \(r\) flows to zero at the critical point.

## Critical Exponents

The critical exponents describe how physical quantities behave near the critical point. At the Wilson-Fisher fixed point, these exponents can be calculated using the RG approach.

### Anomalous Dimension \(\eta\)

The anomalous dimension \(\eta\) of the field \(\phi\) at the fixed point is related to the scaling behavior of the two-point correlation function. To one-loop order:

$$
\eta = \frac{(N+2)}{2(N+8)^2} \epsilon^2
$$

### Correlation Length Exponent \(\nu\)

The correlation length \(\xi\) diverges near the critical point as \(\xi \sim |t|^{-\nu}\), where \(t\) is the reduced temperature. The exponent \(\nu\) is related to the eigenvalue of the stability matrix at the fixed point:

$$
\nu^{-1} = 2 - \epsilon \frac{N+2}{N+8}
$$

To one-loop order:

$$
\nu = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\epsilon}{4(N+8)}
$$

### Other Exponents

Other critical exponents, such as \(\alpha\), \(\beta\), and \(\gamma\), can be derived from \(\nu\) and \(\eta\) using scaling relations. For instance:

- \(\alpha = 2 - d\nu\)
- \(\beta = \frac{1}{2}(d-2+\eta)\nu\)
- \(\gamma = (2 - \eta)\nu\)

### Universality Classes

The Wilson-Fisher fixed point describes the universal critical behavior of a wide variety of systems, including:
- The Ising model (\(N=1\)),
- The XY model (\(N=2\)),
- The Heisenberg model (\(N=3\)).

These systems, despite having different microscopic details, share the same critical exponents and scaling behavior near their respective critical points.

## Applications

### Condensed Matter Physics

The Wilson-Fisher fixed point is used to understand phase transitions in condensed matter systems, such as magnets, superfluids, and liquid crystals.

### High Energy Physics

In high-energy physics, the techniques developed to study the Wilson-Fisher fixed point are applied to analyze the behavior of quantum field theories at different energy scales.

### Statistical Mechanics

In statistical mechanics, the Wilson-Fisher fixed point provides a framework for understanding the critical behavior of systems undergoing second-order phase transitions.
