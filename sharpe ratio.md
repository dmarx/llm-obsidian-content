### Sharpe Ratio

The Sharpe Ratio is a widely used measure in [[finance]] that helps investors understand the risk-adjusted return of an investment or a portfolio. It quantifies how much excess return you receive for the extra volatility you endure for holding a riskier asset. The higher the Sharpe Ratio, the better the risk-adjusted performance of the investment.

#### Definition

The Sharpe Ratio is defined as:

$$ \text{Sharpe Ratio} = \frac{E[R_p] - R_f}{\sigma_p} $$

where:
- \( E[R_p] \) is the expected return of the portfolio or investment.
- \( R_f \) is the risk-free rate of return.
- \( \sigma_p \) is the standard deviation of the portfolio's or investment's excess return (a measure of its risk).

#### Interpretation

- **High Sharpe Ratio**: Indicates that the investment has a high return for its risk. Generally, a higher Sharpe Ratio is better.
- **Low Sharpe Ratio**: Indicates that the investment has a low return for its risk. A negative Sharpe Ratio indicates that the risk-free rate is higher than the portfolio’s return.

#### Steps to Calculate the Sharpe Ratio

1. **Determine the Expected Return of the Portfolio (\( E[R_p] \))**:
   - This can be historical average return or an expected future return based on financial models.
   
2. **Determine the Risk-Free Rate (\( R_f \))**:
   - The risk-free rate is typically the return on government bonds such as U.S. Treasury bills. It represents the return on an investment with no risk of financial loss.
   
3. **Calculate the Excess Return**:
   - Excess return is the return of the portfolio above the risk-free rate: \( E[R_p] - R_f \).
   
4. **Calculate the Standard Deviation of the Portfolio’s Return (\( \sigma_p \))**:
   - This represents the volatility or risk of the portfolio.

5. **Compute the Sharpe Ratio**:
   - Divide the excess return by the standard deviation of the portfolio's return: \( \frac{E[R_p] - R_f}{\sigma_p} \).

#### Example Calculation

Suppose an investor wants to evaluate the performance of a mutual fund over the past year. The relevant data is:
- **Expected Return of the Fund (\( E[R_p] \))**: 12%
- **Risk-Free Rate (\( R_f \))**: 2%
- **Standard Deviation of the Fund’s Return (\( \sigma_p \))**: 15%

Using the Sharpe Ratio formula:

$$ \text{Sharpe Ratio} = \frac{12\% - 2\%}{15\%} = \frac{10\%}{15\%} = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.67 $$

A Sharpe Ratio of 0.67 means that for every unit of risk, the fund provides a return of 0.67 units above the risk-free rate.

#### Uses of the Sharpe Ratio

1. **Comparing Investments**: Investors use the Sharpe Ratio to compare the risk-adjusted returns of different investments or portfolios. The investment with the higher Sharpe Ratio is generally preferred.
2. **Performance Evaluation**: It helps in evaluating the performance of a portfolio manager by considering both return and risk.
3. **Optimization**: Portfolio managers use the Sharpe Ratio in the optimization process to construct portfolios that maximize risk-adjusted returns.

#### Limitations

1. **Assumes Normal Distribution**: The Sharpe Ratio assumes that returns are normally distributed, which may not be true for all investments, especially those with skewed or fat-tailed distributions.
2. **Ignores Skewness and Kurtosis**: It does not account for skewness (asymmetry of returns) and kurtosis (fat tails) in the return distribution.
3. **Static Measure**: It does not adjust for changes in risk over time and may not be suitable for dynamic strategies.
4. **Historical Dependence**: The ratio is often calculated based on historical data, which may not predict future performance accurately.

#### Adjusted Sharpe Ratio

To address some of these limitations, adjustments to the Sharpe Ratio, such as the Modified Sharpe Ratio, take into account higher moments of the return distribution like skewness and kurtosis.

### Summary

The Sharpe Ratio is a crucial tool in [[finance]] for assessing the risk-adjusted return of an investment or portfolio. By comparing the excess return over the risk-free rate to the volatility of returns, it provides a standardized way to evaluate investment performance. Despite its limitations, it remains a popular metric for investors and portfolio managers to compare and optimize investments based on their risk and return characteristics.
