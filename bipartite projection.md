title: bipartite projection

**USER**

bipartite projection


**ASSISTANT**

A bipartite projection is a method used in network science to transform a bipartite graph (also known as a two-mode network) into a one-mode (unipartite) network. In a bipartite graph, nodes are divided into two distinct sets, and edges can only connect nodes from different sets. This type of network is common in scenarios where there are two types of entities, and connections only exist between unlike entities, such as authors and publications, actors and movies, or customers and products.

The projection of a bipartite graph onto one of its sets creates a new network consisting only of nodes from that set, with edges between them based on their shared connections to nodes in the other set in the original bipartite graph. This process results in a unipartite network that highlights the relationships between entities of the same type based on their common relationships with entities of the other type.

### Steps in Bipartite Projection

1. **Select the Node Set for Projection:** Choose one of the two sets of nodes in the bipartite graph as the basis for the projection. This set will form the nodes of the resulting unipartite network.

2. **Establish Connections Based on Shared Partners:** In the resulting unipartite network, create an edge between two nodes if they have at least one shared neighbor (i.e., a common connection) in the other set of the original bipartite graph.

3. **Weight the Edges (Optional):** In some applications, it may be useful to weight the edges in the projected network based on the number of shared neighbors or some other metric that reflects the strength or intensity of the relationship.

### Example

Consider a simple bipartite network of actors and movies. The two sets of nodes are actors and the movies in which they have appeared. In the projected network based on the set of actors, there would be an edge between any two actors who have appeared in at least one movie together. The weight of an edge could represent the number of movies shared between the two actors, indicating the strength of their professional collaboration.

### Applications

Bipartite projections are widely used in various fields to uncover hidden patterns and relationships:

- **Social Network Analysis:** Revealing connections between individuals based on shared affiliations, events, or collaborations.
  
- **Collaboration Networks:** Identifying collaborations among scientists or authors by projecting their co-authorship of papers or projects.
  
- **Recommendation Systems:** Generating product recommendation networks by projecting the connections between customers and products they have purchased.

### Considerations and Challenges

- **Loss of Information:** The projection process may result in the loss of some information about the original bipartite relationships, as it only retains information about shared connections.

- **Edge Density:** Projected networks can become very dense, especially if many nodes in the original bipartite graph share connections. This can make analysis and visualization challenging.

- **Interpretation:** The meaning of edges in the projected network is different from that in the original bipartite network. In the projected network, edges represent indirect connections through the bipartite network's other set.

Bipartite projection is a powerful tool for simplifying and analyzing complex networks by focusing on the relationships within a single set of nodes. However, the method's utility and the interpretation of results depend heavily on the context of the bipartite network and the objectives of the analysis.

bipartite projection


**ASSISTANT**

A bipartite projection is a process used to simplify the structure of bipartite graphs, which are a specific type of graph where nodes can be divided into two disjoint sets such that edges only connect nodes from different sets. The bipartite projection onto one of these sets creates a new graph consisting only of nodes from that set, with edges between nodes that were connected through nodes in the other set in the original bipartite graph.

### Original Bipartite Graph

Consider a bipartite graph \(G=(U,V,E)\), where:
- \(U\) and \(V\) are the two disjoint sets of nodes.
- \(E\) is the set of edges, and each edge connects a node in \(U\) to a node in \(V\).

This structure is common in scenarios like authorship networks (where \(U\) could be authors, \(V\) could be papers, and edges represent authorship), or in customer-product networks (where \(U\) could be customers, \(V\) could be products, and edges indicate purchases).

### Bipartite Projection

The projection of \(G\) onto the set \(U\) is a new graph \(G_U=(U,E_U)\) where:
- \(U\) is the same set of nodes from the original graph.
- \(E_U\) is the set of edges formed between nodes in \(U\) based on their shared connections to nodes in \(V\) in the original graph. Specifically, an edge is placed between \(u_1\) and \(u_2\) in \(G_U\) if and only if there exists at least one node \(v\) in \(V\) such that both \(u_1\) and \(u_2\) are connected to \(v\) in the original graph \(G\).

### Characteristics and Applications

- **Information Loss:** The projection process can lead to information loss regarding the original bipartite structure since the distinction between the two sets of nodes and the specifics of their connections through \(V\) are not retained in the projection.

- **Increased Density:** Bipartite projections often result in denser graphs, especially if many nodes in \(U\) share connections to common nodes in \(V\). This can sometimes lead to challenges in analysis due to the increased complexity of the resulting network.

- **Community Detection:** Projections are particularly useful for revealing hidden patterns or communities within one set of nodes, based on their shared relationships with the other set.

- **Simplification for Analysis:** While some information is lost, the simplification can make certain types of analysis more feasible, particularly when the focus is on understanding the relationships and interactions within one set of nodes.

### Example

In a simple authorship network:
- Let \(U = \{\text{Alice, Bob, Charlie}\}\) be authors.
- Let \(V = \{\text{Paper 1, Paper 2}\}\) be papers.
- Edges represent authorship, e.g., Alice and Bob wrote Paper 1, while Bob and Charlie wrote Paper 2.

The projection onto \(U\) yields a graph where:
- Nodes are authors: \(\{\text{Alice, Bob, Charlie}\}\).
- Edges are formed between all pairs of authors who co-authored at least one paper, resulting in a fully connected graph among Alice, Bob, and Charlie, indicating their collaboration network.

Bipartite projections thus provide a powerful tool for analyzing the inherent structures and relationships within one category of nodes, based on their interactions with another category, across various fields like social network analysis, biology, and more.
