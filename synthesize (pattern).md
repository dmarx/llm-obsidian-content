# Synthesize (Pattern)

In [[functional programming]] and [[category theory]], synthesis represents a systematic approach to combining simpler components into more complex structures while preserving desirable properties. The term has crucial applications across [[type theory]], [[program synthesis]], and [[automated reasoning]].

## Mathematical Formalization

### Category Theoretic Definition
Let C be a category and A,B ∈ Ob(C). The synthesis of A and B, denoted A⊕B, is defined through the following [[universal construction]]:

```
∃S ∈ Ob(C), ∃f:A→S, g:B→S such that
∀X ∈ Ob(C), ∀h:A→X, k:B→X
∃!m:S→X where h = m∘f ∧ k = m∘g
```

### Type Theoretic View
In typed lambda calculus:
```
Γ ⊢ e₁:τ₁   Γ ⊢ e₂:τ₂
-------------------------
Γ ⊢ synth(e₁,e₂):τ₁⊕τ₂
```

## Key Properties

### Compositionality
For synthesis operator ⊕:
```
(A⊕B)⊕C ≅ A⊕(B⊕C)  // Associativity
A⊕B ≅ B⊕A           // Commutativity (when applicable)
```

### Preservation Properties
Let P be a property and ⊨ denote satisfaction:
```
A ⊨ P ∧ B ⊨ P ⟹ (A⊕B) ⊨ P  // Property preservation
```

## Applications

### Program Synthesis
In [[automated programming]]:
```
spec ⊢ ∃p₁,p₂. (p₁⊕p₂ satisfies spec) ∧
               (∀q₁,q₂. size(p₁⊕p₂) ≤ size(q₁⊕q₂))
```

### Knowledge Synthesis
In [[knowledge representation]]:
```
KB₁ ∪ KB₂ ⊢ φ ⟺ ∃ψ₁,ψ₂. (KB₁ ⊢ ψ₁) ∧ (KB₂ ⊢ ψ₂) ∧ (ψ₁∧ψ₂ ⊢ φ)
```
