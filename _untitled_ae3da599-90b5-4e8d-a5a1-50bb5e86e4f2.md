**ASSISTANT**

**/r/mods** (to influence decisions and prioritize reward-seeking actions).

---

### **Higher-Order Cognitive Agents**
These agents are responsible for reasoning, planning, and complex decision-making.

#### **16. Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex Agent (Goal-Oriented Planning)**
- **Role**: Handles reasoning, long-term planning, and problem-solving.
- **Subscribes to**:
  - **/r/mods** (for high-level goal management).
  - **/r/memory** (to retrieve past experiences or knowledge relevant to goals).
  - **/r/episodic_buffer** (for integrating multiple types of information when solving complex problems).
- **Posts to**:
  - **/r/mods** (to issue commands for goal-directed actions).
  - **/r/action** (to execute complex motor plans based on goals).

### **Summary of Agents and Their Subscriptions**

- **Sensory Processing Agents**: Subscribe to **/r/all** for raw input, then post to **/r/phonological_loop**, **/r/visuospatial_sketchpad**, etc.
- **Working Memory Agents**: Subscribe to sensory subreddits and **/r/memory**, posting to relevant working memory subreddits.
- **Executive Control Agents**: Subscribe to all working memory subreddits and **/r/memory**, posting to **/r/mods** and **/r/action**.
- **Memory Agents**: Subscribe to working memory subreddits and **/r/episodic_buffer**, posting back to working memory or **/r/mods** for decision-making.
- **Action Agents**: Subscribe to **/r/mods** and relevant sensory subreddits, posting to **/r/action** to control movement.
- **Emotional and Reward Agents**: Subscribe to sensory subreddits, **/r/memory**, and **/r/mods**, influencing behavior based on emotion and reward signals.

By defining these agents and their roles, we can create a dynamic, modular system where cognitive and neurological components interact through subreddits, simulating the complex interactions of a cognitive system.
