frechet derivatives


**ASSISTANT**

The Fréchet derivative is a generalization of the concept of a derivative to functions between Banach spaces (or more generally, normed vector spaces). It extends the idea of differentiability from finite-dimensional spaces to infinite-dimensional spaces, and is essential in functional analysis and applications involving infinite-dimensional function spaces.

### Definition

Let \( X \) and \( Y \) be Banach spaces, and let \( f: X \to Y \) be a function. The Fréchet derivative of \( f \) at a point \( x \in X \) is a bounded linear operator \( A: X \to Y \) such that

$$
\lim_{\| h \|_X \to 0} \frac{\| f(x + h) - f(x) - A(h) \|_Y}{\| h \|_X} = 0.
$$

If such an operator \( A \) exists, it is unique and is denoted by \( Df(x) \) or \( f'(x) \).

### Intuition

The Fréchet derivative \( Df(x) \) can be thought of as the best linear approximation to \( f \) at the point \( x \). In finite-dimensional spaces, it reduces to the Jacobian matrix. In infinite-dimensional spaces, it generalizes to a bounded linear operator.

### Example

Consider a simple example in \( \mathbb{R}^n \):

Let \( f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R} \) be given by \( f(x) = \| x \|^2 \). To find the Fréchet derivative at a point \( x \), we compute:

$$
f(x + h) = \| x + h \|^2 = \| x \|^2 + 2 \langle x, h \rangle + \| h \|^2,
$$
where \( \langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle \) denotes the inner product in \( \mathbb{R}^n \).

The linear part of the increment \( f(x + h) - f(x) \) is \( 2 \langle x, h \rangle \). Hence, the Fréchet derivative at \( x \) is the linear operator \( A(h) = 2 \langle x, h \rangle \), which can be represented by the gradient \( \nabla f(x) = 2x \).

### Properties

1. **Linearity:** The Fréchet derivative \( Df(x) \) is a bounded linear operator.
2. **Uniqueness:** If \( f \) is Fréchet differentiable at \( x \), then the operator \( Df(x) \) is unique.
3. **Continuity:** If \( f \) is Fréchet differentiable at \( x \), then \( f \) is continuous at \( x \).
4. **Chain Rule:** If \( f: X \to Y \) and \( g: Y \to Z \) are Fréchet differentiable at \( x \) and \( f(x) \) respectively, then the composition \( g \circ f \) is Fréchet differentiable at \( x \), and
   $$
   D(g \circ f)(x) = Dg(f(x)) \circ Df(x).
   $$

### Higher-Order Fréchet Derivatives

The Fréchet derivative can be extended to higher-order derivatives. The second Fréchet derivative \( D^2f(x) \) at \( x \) is a bilinear map such that:

$$
\lim_{\| h \|_X, \| k \|_X \to 0} \frac{\| f(x + h + k) - f(x + h) - f(x + k) + f(x) - D^2f(x)(h, k) \|_Y}{\| h \|_X \| k \|_X} = 0.
$$

In general, the \( n \)-th Fréchet derivative \( D^n f(x) \) is an \( n \)-linear map.

### Application: Variational Calculus

In variational calculus, Fréchet derivatives are used to find extrema of functionals. Consider a functional \( J: V \to \mathbb{R} \), where \( V \) is a Banach space of functions. The Fréchet derivative of \( J \) at \( u \in V \) is a linear operator \( DJ(u): V \to \mathbb{R} \). A necessary condition for \( u \) to be an extremum of \( J \) is \( DJ(u) = 0 \).

### Conclusion

The Fréchet derivative is a powerful generalization of the derivative concept to infinite-dimensional spaces, providing a foundation for advanced analysis in functional analysis, partial differential equations, and optimization.
