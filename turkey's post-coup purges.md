Turkey's Post-Coup Purges


**ASSISTANT**

Turkey's post-coup purges represent a significant example of political repression and state-sanctioned persecution following a failed coup attempt. This section will detail the background, implementation, and impact of these purges.

## Background

On July 15, 2016, elements within the Turkish military attempted a coup d'état against the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. The coup was quickly suppressed, but it resulted in significant casualties and widespread chaos. In the aftermath, the Turkish government launched extensive purges, targeting individuals and institutions suspected of involvement in the coup or association with the Gülen movement, which it blamed for orchestrating the coup.

## Implementation

### State of Emergency

Immediately following the coup attempt, the Turkish government declared a state of emergency, which lasted for two years until July 2018. This state of emergency granted the government extraordinary powers to bypass the usual legislative process and issue decrees with the force of law. 

### Mass Arrests and Dismissals

The purges were implemented through a series of decrees and actions that targeted various sectors:

- **Military**: Tens of thousands of military personnel were dismissed, including high-ranking officers. Many were arrested and tried for their alleged involvement in the coup.
- **Civil Service**: Approximately 130,000 civil servants, including judges, prosecutors, police officers, and teachers, were dismissed or suspended.
- **Education**: Thousands of academics were dismissed, and many universities were shut down. The government also took over numerous private schools and educational institutions linked to the Gülen movement.
- **Media**: Hundreds of media outlets, including newspapers, television stations, and websites, were shut down. Numerous journalists were arrested, leading to a significant crackdown on press freedom.
- **Business**: Assets of companies and individuals suspected of financing or supporting the coup plotters were seized.

### Legal Proceedings and Human Rights Violations

- **Detentions**: Over 77,000 people were formally arrested, and many more were detained for extended periods without trial.
- **Torture and Ill-Treatment**: Reports from international human rights organizations, such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, documented instances of torture, ill-treatment, and forced disappearances of detainees.
- **Lack of Due Process**: Many of the accused were denied access to legal representation, faced prolonged pre-trial detention, and were tried in courts that lacked independence from executive influence.

## Impact

### Political Repression

- **Consolidation of Power**: The purges allowed President Erdoğan and the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) to consolidate power by removing potential rivals and critics. This led to a significant weakening of political opposition and dissent.
- **Erosion of Rule of Law**: The extensive use of emergency decrees and the undermining of judicial independence eroded the rule of law and democratic norms in Turkey.
- **Chilling Effect**: The widespread arrests and dismissals created a climate of fear and self-censorship among civil servants, academics, journalists, and activists.

### Social and Economic Disruption

- **Disruption of Services**: The dismissal of a large number of public servants and professionals disrupted public services, including education, healthcare, and judicial processes.
- **Economic Impact**: The seizure of businesses and assets, combined with the loss of skilled professionals, had a negative impact on the Turkish economy.

### International Response

- **Condemnation**: The purges drew widespread condemnation from international human rights organizations, the European Union, and various governments, who criticized the Turkish government for human rights abuses and the undermining of democratic principles.
- **Strained Relations**: Turkey's relations with the EU and the United States were strained, particularly due to concerns over human rights and the rule of law.

### Legacy

The legacy of the post-coup purges is a deeply polarized society, with significant segments of the population feeling disenfranchised and oppressed. The purges have left lasting scars on Turkey's political, social, and economic fabric, raising concerns about the future of democracy and human rights in the country.
