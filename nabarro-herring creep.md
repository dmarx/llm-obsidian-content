# Nabarro-Herring Creep

Nabarro-Herring creep is a mechanism of creep deformation that occurs at high temperatures and low to moderate stresses, predominantly in polycrystalline materials. It is driven by the diffusion of atoms through the bulk of grains (Nabarro-Herring creep) or along [[grain boundaries]] (Coble creep) in response to applied stress. This diffusion causes the grains to elongate in the direction of the applied stress and shrink perpendicular to it.

## Mechanism of Nabarro-Herring Creep

Nabarro-Herring creep involves the diffusion of atoms from [[grain boundaries]] experiencing compressive stress to those experiencing tensile stress. This atomic movement leads to a net deformation of the material. The process can be summarized as follows:

1. **Stress Distribution**: Under an applied stress, atoms move from regions of high compressive stress to regions of high tensile stress within a grain.
2. **Atomic Diffusion**: Atoms diffuse through the crystal lattice (volume diffusion) from areas of high chemical potential (compressive regions) to areas of low chemical potential (tensile regions).
3. **Grain Deformation**: As atoms move, grains elongate along the direction of the applied stress and contract perpendicular to it, resulting in macroscopic creep deformation.

## Mathematical Formulation

The steady-state creep rate (\(\dot{\epsilon}_{\text{ss}}\)) due to Nabarro-Herring creep can be expressed as:

$$
\dot{\epsilon}_{\text{ss}} = \frac{A D_v \sigma \Omega}{kT d^2}
$$

where:
- \(\dot{\epsilon}_{\text{ss}}\) is the steady-state creep rate.
- \(A\) is a dimensionless constant.
- \(D_v\) is the volume diffusion coefficient.
- \(\sigma\) is the applied stress.
- \(\Omega\) is the atomic volume.
- \(k\) is the Boltzmann constant.
- \(T\) is the absolute temperature.
- \(d\) is the average grain diameter.

### Volume Diffusion Coefficient (\(D_v\))

The volume diffusion coefficient \(D_v\) follows an Arrhenius-type temperature dependence:

$$
D_v = D_{v0} \exp\left(-\frac{Q_v}{RT}\right)
$$

where:
- \(D_{v0}\) is the pre-exponential factor.
- \(Q_v\) is the activation energy for volume diffusion.
- \(R\) is the universal gas constant.

### Factors Influencing Nabarro-Herring Creep

#### Temperature

- Higher temperatures increase atomic mobility, enhancing diffusion rates and thus increasing the creep rate.

#### Grain Size

- Smaller grain sizes lead to higher creep rates because the diffusion distance for atoms is shorter, facilitating easier deformation.

#### Applied Stress

- Higher applied stresses increase the chemical potential gradient, driving a faster diffusion process and increasing the creep rate.

## Comparison with Other Creep Mechanisms

### Coble Creep

- **Mechanism**: Coble creep involves diffusion along [[grain boundaries]] rather than through the grain interior. It is more significant in materials with very fine grains or at lower temperatures where grain boundary diffusion dominates.
- **Rate Equation**: The steady-state creep rate for Coble creep can be expressed as:

  $$
  \dot{\epsilon}_{\text{ss}} = \frac{B D_b \sigma \Omega}{kT d^3}
  $$

  where \(D_b\) is the grain boundary diffusion coefficient and \(B\) is a dimensionless constant.

### Dislocation Creep

- **Mechanism**: Dislocation creep involves the motion of dislocations through the crystal lattice, which is significant at higher stresses and lower temperatures compared to Nabarro-Herring creep.
- **Rate Equation**: The steady-state creep rate for [[dislocation creep]] can be described by the Norton-Bailey law:

  $$
  \dot{\epsilon}_{\text{ss}} = A \sigma^n \exp\left(-\frac{Q}{RT}\right)
  $$

  where \(n\) typically ranges from 3 to 8 for metals.

## Applications and Examples

### High-Temperature Alloys

- **Nickel-Based Superalloys**: Used in turbine blades and jet engines, these materials operate at high temperatures where Nabarro-Herring creep can be significant.

### Structural Components

- **Boiler Tubes and Heat Exchangers**: Components subjected to high temperatures for prolonged periods, where Nabarro-Herring creep can contribute to deformation and failure.

### Polycrystalline Metals

- **Aluminum and Copper**: Common polycrystalline metals where Nabarro-Herring creep can be observed at elevated temperatures.

## Experimental Techniques for Studying Nabarro-Herring Creep

### Creep Testing

- **Constant Load and Temperature**: Specimens are subjected to a constant load at a constant temperature while measuring the strain over time to determine the steady-state creep rate.

### Grain Size Control

- **Heat Treatment**: Grain size can be controlled through heat treatment processes, allowing for the study of its effect on creep behavior.

### Microscopy

- **Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)**: TEM can be used to observe atomic diffusion and grain boundary movements directly, providing insights into the mechanisms of Nabarro-Herring creep.

### Diffusion Measurements

- **Tracer Diffusion Studies**: Using isotopic tracers to measure diffusion rates in the material, which can then be correlated with creep rates.

## Conclusion

Nabarro-Herring creep is a fundamental mechanism of high-temperature deformation in polycrystalline materials, driven by atomic diffusion through the bulk of grains. Understanding this mechanism is crucial for predicting the long-term behavior of materials used in high-temperature applications. By considering factors such as temperature, grain size, and applied stress, engineers can design materials and components that are more resistant to creep deformation.
