## 6. **Estimate Process**

### Overview

The **Estimate Process** is a structured framework used to evaluate a situation, develop options, and make decisions based on a systematic analysis of factors affecting the operation. The Estimate Process is often used in strategic and operational planning and involves a thorough assessment of the mission, enemy, terrain, troops, time, and civil considerations (METT-TC).

### Steps of the Estimate Process

1. **Define the Problem**: Clearly articulate the problem or challenge that needs to be addressed. This involves understanding the mission, objectives, and the operational environment.

2. **Gather and Analyze Information**: Collect and analyze relevant information, including intelligence on enemy forces, terrain, weather, and other factors that could impact the operation.

3. **Develop COAs**: Develop multiple COAs based on the information gathered and analyzed. Each COA should represent a different approach to solving the problem or achieving the mission.

4. **Analyze COAs**: Evaluate each COA using criteria such as feasibility, acceptability, suitability, and risk. The analysis should consider the advantages and disadvantages of each option.

5. **Compare COAs**: Compare the COAs against each other based on the established criteria to determine which one is most likely to achieve the desired outcome.

6. **Make a Decision**: Select the COA that best addresses the problem and aligns with the commander’s intent. The decision should be based on a thorough analysis and comparison of the options.

### Key Features

- **Comprehensive Analysis**: The Estimate Process involves a thorough analysis of all relevant factors, ensuring that decisions are based on a comprehensive understanding of the situation.
- **Structured and Systematic**: The process follows a structured approach to decision-making, providing a clear framework for evaluating options and making informed choices.
- **Focus on METT-TC**: Emphasizes the analysis of mission, enemy, terrain, troops, time, and civil considerations, ensuring that all critical factors are considered.

## Conclusion

Structured frameworks are essential tools in military operations for coordinating and prioritizing decision-making. These frameworks, such as the **Military Decision-Making Process (MDMP)**, **Operations Process**, **Joint Planning Process (JPP)**, **Rapid Decision-Making and Synchronization Process (RDSP)**, **OODA Loop**, and the **Estimate Process**, provide systematic approaches to analyze situations, evaluate options, and make informed decisions under complex and dynamic conditions. By providing clear, structured methods for planning and decision-making, these frameworks enhance the effectiveness, adaptability, and resilience of military operations, ensuring that commanders and their staff can respond effectively to the challenges they face.

Military Decision-Making Process (MDMP)


**ASSISTANT**

The **Military Decision-Making Process (MDMP)** is a structured, analytical process used by military commanders and their staffs to make informed decisions and develop detailed plans for military operations. The MDMP provides a standardized framework for analyzing complex situations, developing multiple [[courses of action]] (COAs), and selecting the most appropriate COA to achieve mission objectives. This process is designed to be comprehensive, ensuring that all relevant factors are considered, and is typically used at the battalion level and above.

## Objectives of the Military Decision-Making Process (MDMP)

1. **Ensure Thorough Analysis**: MDMP provides a systematic approach to analyze the mission, the operational environment, and all relevant factors to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the situation.
2. **Develop and Evaluate COAs**: Create multiple COAs that are feasible, acceptable, and suitable, allowing commanders to evaluate different options for achieving the mission.
3. **Support Commander's Decision-Making**: Provide the commander with detailed analysis and recommendations to support decision-making and ensure alignment with the commander’s intent.
4. **Enhance Coordination and Synchronization**: Ensure that all elements of the force are coordinated and synchronized to achieve unity of effort and maximize operational effectiveness.
5. **Facilitate Flexibility and Adaptability**: Allow for adjustments and modifications based on changing conditions or new information, ensuring that plans remain relevant and effective.

## Steps of the MDMP

The MDMP consists of seven key steps, each involving specific tasks and outputs that contribute to the overall planning process. Here is an overview of each step:

### 1. **Receipt of Mission**

- **Purpose**: To alert the staff and subordinate units to a new mission and initiate the planning process.
- **Tasks**:
  - Receive the initial mission or order from higher headquarters.
  - Conduct a quick assessment of the time available for planning, preparation, and execution.
  - Issue a warning order (WARNO) to alert subordinate units and staff to the upcoming operation, including initial information about the mission, timeline, and key tasks.
  - Assemble the planning team and begin preparing for the [[mission analysis]].

- **Outputs**:
  - Initial WARNO issued to subordinate units and staff.
  - Planning timeline established.
  - Commander’s initial guidance provided to staff.

### 2. **Mission Analysis**

- **Purpose**: To develop a thorough understanding of the mission, identify specified, implied, and essential tasks, and assess the operational environment.
- **Tasks**:
  - Analyze the higher headquarters’ order, intent, and [[concept of operations]].
  - Identify specified tasks (explicitly stated in the order), implied tasks (not stated but necessary to accomplish the mission), and essential tasks (critical for mission success).
  - Assess the operational environment, including enemy forces, terrain, weather, and civil considerations (using the METT-TC framework: Mission, Enemy, Terrain and Weather, Troops and Support Available, Time Available, and Civil Considerations).
  - Identify constraints and limitations (restrictions that must be adhered to or actions that are prohibited).
  - Develop an initial risk assessment and identify potential risks to mission accomplishment.
  - Determine the commander’s critical information requirements (CCIRs) and essential elements of friendly information (EEFI).

- **Outputs**:
  - Mission statement refined and clarified.
  - Initial commander’s intent and planning guidance developed.
  - Updated WARNO issued with additional details and tasking guidance.
  - List of specified, implied, and essential tasks.
  - CCIRs and EEFI identified.

### 3. **Course of Action (COA) Development**

- **Purpose**: To develop multiple COAs that provide different options for achieving the mission objectives.
- **Tasks**:
  - Develop at least two or more feasible, acceptable, and suitable COAs that can accomplish the mission within the commander’s intent and constraints.
  - Each COA should clearly outline the “who, what, when, where, why, and how” of the operation, detailing the scheme of maneuver, task organization, and supporting efforts.
  - Ensure that each COA is distinguishable (different enough from other COAs to provide a valid choice).
  - Consider the use of deception, surprise, and indirect approaches where appropriate.

- **Outputs**:
  - A set of developed COAs, each with a narrative description, sketch, and synchronization matrix.
  - Updated risk assessment for each COA.

### 4. **Course of Action (COA) Analysis (Wargaming)**

- **Purpose**: To analyze each COA in detail by simulating its execution against a thinking enemy and identify potential strengths, weaknesses, risks, and opportunities.
- **Tasks**:
  - Conduct a wargame for each COA by simulating friendly and enemy actions and reactions in a turn-by-turn fashion, using various methods (e.g., belt, avenue-in-depth, or box).
  - Evaluate the effectiveness of each COA by assessing the interaction between friendly and enemy forces, the terrain, and other operational factors.
  - Identify decision points, critical events, potential branches (alternative plans to address potential changes), and sequels (follow-on operations).
  - Record the results of the wargame, including any modifications to the COAs, identified risks, and potential contingencies.
