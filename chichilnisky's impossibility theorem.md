Chichilnisky's impossibility theorem


**ASSISTANT**

Chichilnisky's impossibility theorem is a significant result in social choice theory, extending Arrow's impossibility theorem. It addresses the aggregation of preferences and the existence of social welfare functions in the context of a continuous and infinite set of choices, typically relevant in economics and environmental decision-making.

### The Theorem

The formal statement of Chichilnisky's impossibility theorem can be articulated as follows:

**Theorem**: No social choice rule can satisfy the following three conditions simultaneously:
1. **Unanimity (Pareto Efficiency)**: If every individual prefers one option over another, then the social choice should reflect this preference.
2. **Non-dictatorship**: There is no single individual whose preferences always determine the social choice, regardless of others' preferences.
3. **Continuity**: The social choice function is continuous, meaning small changes in individual preferences result in small changes in the social choice.

### Proof Outline

Chichilnisky's theorem hinges on the topological properties of the set of preferences and the social welfare function. The crux of the proof involves demonstrating that the continuity requirement imposes severe restrictions on the social welfare function that are incompatible with unanimity and non-dictatorship.

1. **Preference Representation**: Assume each individual's preferences can be represented by a continuous utility function \( u_i: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \), where \( X \) is a compact metric space (representing the set of all possible social states or outcomes).

2. **Unanimity**: Formally, for any two social states \( x, y \in X \), if \( u_i(x) > u_i(y) \) for all individuals \( i \), then the social welfare function \( W \) must satisfy \( W(x) > W(y) \).

3. **Non-dictatorship**: There is no single individual \( i \) such that for all \( x, y \in X \), \( u_i(x) > u_i(y) \) implies \( W(x) > W(y) \).

4. **Continuity**: The social welfare function \( W: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) is continuous. This means for any sequence \( \{x_n\} \) converging to \( x \), \( W(x_n) \) converges to \( W(x) \).

### Implications

The proof uses topological arguments, often involving fixed-point theorems like Brouwer's or Kakutani's, to show that these conditions cannot be satisfied simultaneously. Essentially, the continuity requirement imposes a constraint that forces the social welfare function to behave in a way that either violates unanimity or non-dictatorship.

### Comparison with Arrow's Theorem

While Arrow's impossibility theorem considers a finite set of alternatives and focuses on the non-existence of a social welfare function that satisfies:
- Unrestricted domain
- Pareto efficiency
- Non-dictatorship
- Independence of irrelevant alternatives

Chichilnisky's theorem extends this by considering an infinite and continuous set of alternatives, replacing the independence of irrelevant alternatives with continuity.

### Applications

Chichilnisky's theorem has profound implications in environmental economics, where choices often lie in a continuum (e.g., levels of pollution, temperature changes). It suggests that creating a fair and efficient aggregation of preferences in such contexts may be fundamentally impossible without sacrificing continuity, which is crucial for stability and predictability in decision-making processes.
