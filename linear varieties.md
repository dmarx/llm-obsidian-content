linear varieties


**ASSISTANT**

In algebraic geometry, a **linear variety** refers to a subset of an affine or projective space that can be described as the solution set of a system of linear equations. These varieties include objects like points, lines, planes, and higher-dimensional hyperplanes. They are among the simplest examples of algebraic varieties and are fundamental to understanding more complex geometric structures.

### Definition and Basic Properties

**Linear Varieties in Affine Spaces**:
- In the context of affine space \( \mathbb{A}^n(k) \) over a field \( k \), a linear variety (or affine linear variety) is defined by a set of linear equations:
  $$
  a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + \ldots + a_{1n}x_n = b_1,
  $$
  $$
  a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + \ldots + a_{2n}x_n = b_2,
  $$
  $$
  \ldots,
  $$
  $$
  a_{m1}x_1 + a_{m2}x_2 + \ldots + a_{mn}x_n = b_m.
  $$
- These equations form a system that can be represented in matrix form as \( A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b} \), where \( A \) is a matrix of coefficients, \( \mathbf{x} \) is the vector of variables, and \( \mathbf{b} \) is the vector of constants.

**Linear Varieties in Projective Spaces**:
- In projective space \( \mathbb{P}^n(k) \), a linear variety (or projective linear variety) is similarly defined by homogeneous linear equations:
  $$
  a_{11}x_0 + a_{12}x_1 + \ldots + a_{1n}x_n = 0,
  $$
  $$
  \ldots,
  $$
  $$
  a_{m1}x_0 + a_{m2}x_1 + \ldots + a_{mn}x_n = 0.
  $$
- These equations must be homogeneous to ensure that the solutions are well-defined in projective space, where points are equivalent up to scalar multiples.

### Examples

1. **Points**:
   - In \( \mathbb{A}^n(k) \), a single point can be defined by the equations \( x_i = c_i \) for \( i = 1, 2, \ldots, n \), specifying the coordinates of the point.
   - In \( \mathbb{P}^n(k) \), a point is typically defined by setting all coordinates but one to zero, scaled appropriately.

2. **Lines**:
   - In \( \mathbb{A}^2(k) \), a line can be described by a single linear equation \( ax + by = c \).
   - In \( \mathbb{P}^2(k) \), a projective line is described by a single homogeneous equation \( ax + by + cz = 0 \).

3. **Planes and Higher-Dimensional Hyperplanes**:
   - In \( \mathbb{A}^3(k) \), a plane might be defined by an equation like \( ax + by + cz = d \).
   - In \( \mathbb{P}^n(k) \), a hyperplane in \( n \)-dimensional projective space is defined by a single equation of the form \( a_0x_0 + a_1x_1 + \ldots + a_nx_n = 0 \).

### Geometric and Algebraic Properties

- **Dimension**: The dimension of a linear variety is given by the difference between the total number of variables and the rank of the matrix of coefficients \( A \) in the system defining the variety.
- **Intersections**: The intersection of linear varieties can itself be a linear variety, defined by combining the systems of equations of the intersecting varieties.
- **Singularities**: Linear varieties do not contain singularities as long as they are nonempty and properly defined, making them smooth varieties.

Linear varieties serve as the building blocks for more complex algebraic constructions and provide a geometric intuition for many algebraic concepts. They are also crucial in applications spanning computational geometry, computer graphics, and optimization.
