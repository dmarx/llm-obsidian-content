### State Feedback Control

State feedback control is a method used in control theory to design controllers by directly using the state variables of the system. This approach is particularly effective in linear time-invariant (LTI) systems and is often used in modern control systems to achieve desired performance and stability.

### Key Concepts

1. **State-Space Representation**: Describes the system dynamics using a set of first-order differential equations in matrix form.
2. **State Feedback**: Involves using the system's state variables to compute the control input.
3. **Pole Placement**: Technique to place the closed-loop poles in desired locations to achieve specific performance criteria.
4. **Controllability**: A property that determines whether it is possible to move the system from any initial state to any desired final state within finite time using appropriate control inputs.

### State-Space Representation

The [[state-space representation]] of an LTI system is given by:

$$
\dot{x}(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t),
$$

$$
y(t) = Cx(t) + Du(t),
$$

where:
- \( x(t) \) is the state vector.
- \( u(t) \) is the control input.
- \( y(t) \) is the output.
- \( A \) is the state matrix.
- \( B \) is the input matrix.
- \( C \) is the output matrix.
- \( D \) is the feedthrough (or direct transmission) matrix.

### State Feedback Control Law

In state feedback control, the control input \( u(t) \) is designed as a linear combination of the state variables:

$$
u(t) = -Kx(t) + r(t),
$$

where:
- \( K \) is the state feedback gain matrix.
- \( r(t) \) is the reference input.

### Designing State Feedback Controller

#### Step 1: Check Controllability

The controllability matrix \( \mathcal{C} \) is given by:

$$
\mathcal{C} = [B \ AB \ A^2B \ \ldots \ A^{n-1}B],
$$

where \( n \) is the number of states. The system is controllable if \( \mathcal{C} \) has full rank (i.e., rank \( n \)).

#### Step 2: Determine Desired Pole Locations

Choose the desired locations for the closed-loop poles based on the performance specifications (e.g., stability, damping ratio, natural frequency).

#### Step 3: Compute Feedback Gain Matrix \( K \)

Use pole placement techniques to determine the state feedback gain matrix \( K \) that places the closed-loop poles at the desired locations.

### Example: State Feedback Design

Consider a system with the [[state-space representation]]:

$$
\dot{x}(t) = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -2 & -3 \end{bmatrix} x(t) + \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} u(t),
$$

$$
y(t) = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} x(t).
$$

#### Step 1: Check Controllability

The controllability matrix is:

$$
\mathcal{C} = \begin{bmatrix} B & AB \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & -3 \end{bmatrix}.
$$

Since \( \det(\mathcal{C}) = -1 \neq 0 \), the system is controllable.

#### Step 2: Determine Desired Pole Locations

Assume we want the closed-loop poles to be at \( -2 \) and \( -3 \).

#### Step 3: Compute Feedback Gain Matrix \( K \)

The characteristic polynomial of the desired closed-loop system is:

$$
(s + 2)(s + 3) = s^2 + 5s + 6.
$$

The characteristic polynomial of the closed-loop system with state feedback is:

$$
\det(sI - (A - BK)) = s^2 + (a_{11} + a_{22} - k_1)s + (a_{11}a_{22} - a_{12}a_{21} - a_{22}k_1 + b_{2}k_2).
$$

For the given system:

$$
\dot{x}(t) = (A - BK)x(t),
$$

where \( K = \begin{bmatrix} k_1 & k_2 \end{bmatrix} \).

Substitute \( A \) and \( B \) and match coefficients with the desired characteristic polynomial:

$$
A - BK = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -2 & -3 \end{bmatrix} - \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} k_1 & k_2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -2 - k_1 & -3 - k_2 \end{bmatrix}.
$$

The characteristic equation is:

$$
s^2 + (3 + k_2)s + (2 + k_1) = s^2 + 5s + 6.
$$

Matching coefficients:

$$
3 + k_2 = 5 \implies k_2 = 2,
$$

$$
2 + k_1 = 6 \implies k_1 = 4.
$$

So, the state feedback gain matrix is:

$$
K = \begin{bmatrix} 4 & 2 \end{bmatrix}.
$$

### Full-State Feedback Controller

For the given system:

$$
u(t) = -Kx(t) + r(t) = -\begin{bmatrix} 4 & 2 \end{bmatrix} x(t) + r(t).
$$

### Observer Design (Optional)

If not all state variables are measurable, an observer (state estimator) can be designed to estimate the state variables. The observer uses the system output \( y(t) \) to reconstruct the state vector \( x(t) \).

### Conclusion

State feedback control is a powerful method for designing controllers for linear systems. By using the state variables directly and placing the closed-loop poles in desired locations, engineers can achieve specific performance criteria.
