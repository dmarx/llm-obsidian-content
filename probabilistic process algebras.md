# Probabilistic Process Algebras

[[Probabilistic process algebras]] extend classical [[process algebras]] by incorporating quantitative information about the likelihood of different behaviors. These formalisms enable reasoning about both functional and probabilistic properties of concurrent systems.

## Mathematical Foundation

A probabilistic process algebra operates over a [[probability space]] (Ω, F, P) where:
- Ω is the sample space of possible behaviors
- F is a σ-algebra over Ω
- P: F → [0,1] is a probability measure

### Core Concepts

1. [[Probabilistic Transition Systems]]
   A tuple (S, Act, →, μ) where:
   - S is a set of states
   - Act is a set of actions
   - → ⊆ S × Act × Dist(S) is the transition relation
   - μ: S → Dist(S) is the probabilistic transition function
   where Dist(S) represents the set of discrete probability distributions over S

2. [[Probabilistic Bisimulation]]
   For states s, t ∈ S, s ∼p t if there exists an equivalence relation R such that:
   ∀(s,t) ∈ R, ∀α ∈ Act: μ(s,α,C) = μ(t,α,C) for all equivalence classes C of R

## Major Frameworks

### [[PCCS]] (Probabilistic CCS)
Extends [[CCS]] with probabilistic choice operator:

p ::= 0 | α.p | p +p p | p || p | p\L | x | rec x.p

where +p represents probabilistic choice with:
p +p q = p with probability p, q with probability (1-p)

### [[PEPA]] (Performance Evaluation Process Algebra)
Combines [[exponential distributions]] with process algebra:

Syntax:
P ::= (α,r).P | P + P | P ⊕p P | P ∥L P | P/L | X

where:
- (α,r) represents action α with rate r
- ⊕p represents probabilistic choice with probability p
- ∥L represents cooperation over action set L

### [[pACP]] (probabilistic Algebra of Communicating Processes)
Extends [[ACP]] with probabilistic operators:

[[Probabilistic Sequential Composition]]:
(x ⊕p y) · z = (x · z) ⊕p (y · z)

[[Probabilistic Parallel Composition]]:
(x ⊕p y) ∥ z = (x ∥ z) ⊕p (y ∥ z)

## Analysis Techniques

### [[Probabilistic Model Checking]]
Formula: P≥p[φ]
- Verifies that property φ holds with probability at least p

### [[Quantitative Analysis]]
1. [[Expected Time Analysis]]:
   E[T] = Σi pi · ti where:
   - pi is the probability of path i
   - ti is the time along path i

2. [[Steady State Analysis]]:
   π = πP where:
   - π is the steady state distribution
   - P is the transition probability matrix

## Applications

1. [[Performance Evaluation]]
   - [[Throughput Analysis]]
   - [[Response Time Prediction]]
   - [[Resource Utilization]]

2. [[Reliability Analysis]]
   - [[Fault Tolerance]]
   - [[System Availability]]
   - [[Mean Time To Failure]]

3. [[Security Analysis]]
   - [[Protocol Security]]
   - [[Information Flow]]
   - [[Attack Probability]]

## Advanced Topics

### [[Continuous Time]]
Incorporates [[exponential distributions]] for timing:
rate(α,P) = r means action α occurs with rate r in process P

### [[Hybrid Systems]]
Combines probabilistic behavior with [[continuous dynamics]]:
- [[Stochastic Differential Equations]]
- [[Hybrid Automata]]

### [[Compositional Reasoning]]
Properties of subsystems combine to yield system properties:
P(φ1 ∧ φ2) = P(φ1) · P(φ2) for independent properties

## Semantic Models

1. [[Probabilistic Labeled Transition Systems]]
   (S, Act, →, μ0) where μ0 is initial distribution

2. [[Markov Decision Processes]]
   (S, Act, P, R) where:
   - P: S × Act × S → [0,1] transition probabilities
   - R: S × Act → ℝ rewards

3. [[Continuous Time Markov Chains]]
   Q-matrix representation:
   qij = rate of transition from state i to j

## Verification Properties

1. [[Probabilistic Safety]]
   P≤p[□ φ] - bad event φ occurs with probability ≤p

2. [[Probabilistic Liveness]]
   P≥p[◇ φ] - good event φ occurs with probability ≥p

3. [[Expected Rewards]]
   E[◇ φ] - expected reward until φ occurs
