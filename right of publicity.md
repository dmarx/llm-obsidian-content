**USER**

right of publicity


**ASSISTANT**

The **right of publicity** refers to an individual's right to control and profit from the commercial use of their name, image, likeness, or other unequivocal aspects of their identity. This legal concept is particularly significant in contexts involving celebrities and public figures, but it can apply to any individual whose identity holds commercial value. Here is a detailed breakdown:

## Key Aspects of Right of Publicity

### Definition
The right of publicity protects against the unauthorized exploitation of an individual's persona. This right typically includes:
- **Name**: Both full names and recognizable nicknames.
- **Image**: Photographs, paintings, or other depictions.
- **Likeness**: Anything that invokes the image of the person, including look-alikes.
- **Voice**: Distinctive vocal characteristics or recordings.
- **Signature**: Personal signatures used in a commercial context.
- **Distinctive Phrases or Mannerisms**: Unique elements that are closely associated with the individual.

### Legal Basis
The right of publicity is rooted in common law and statutory law, with its foundations differing by jurisdiction:
- **United States**: Varies significantly between states, with some states like California and New York having robust statutory protections.
- **Internationally**: Protection varies widely, with some countries offering explicit statutory protection and others addressing it under broader privacy or intellectual property laws.

### Duration and Transferability
The duration of the right of publicity can extend beyond an individual's lifetime, creating post-mortem rights:
- **Duration**: Varies by jurisdiction; for example, in California, the right extends for 70 years post-mortem.
- **Transferability**: Rights can be transferred or inherited, allowing heirs to control and profit from the deceased's persona.

### Infringement and Remedies
Unauthorized use of someone's persona can result in legal actions, with potential remedies including:
- **Injunctions**: Court orders to cease the unauthorized use.
- **Damages**: Compensation for any economic loss suffered due to the unauthorized use.
- **Profits**: Disgorgement of profits made from the unauthorized use.

### Balancing Interests
The right of publicity often needs to be balanced against other legal principles, such as:
- **First Amendment**: In the U.S., freedom of speech may conflict with the right of publicity, particularly in cases involving news reporting, commentary, or creative works.
- **Fair Use**: Certain uses may be exempt from infringement claims under doctrines such as [[fair use]].

## Mathematical Formalism

From an economic perspective, the valuation of the right of publicity can be modeled using various approaches, such as:
- **Market Valuation**: Estimating the market value of the individual's persona by examining endorsement deals, licensing agreements, and similar contracts.
- **Income Approach**: Projecting the future income that can be generated from the individual's persona, then discounting it to present value.

Let \( V \) represent the value of the right of publicity. Using the income approach, we can define:

$$
V = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{R_t}{(1 + r)^t}
$$

where:
- \( R_t \) is the revenue expected in year \( t \),
- \( r \) is the discount rate,
- \( n \) is the number of years for which the income is projected.

This formula helps quantify the economic worth of an individual's right of publicity over time, providing a structured method for assessing damages or negotiating licensing agreements.
