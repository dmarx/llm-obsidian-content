title: users may not be equivalently related just by being part of subreddits.

**USER**

>Users may not be equivalently related just by being part of subreddits. 
my goal here is actually to identify or develop notation I can utilize to discuss emergent behavior from large complex collectives, so although individual users are not equivalent *above some critical threshold of complexity we no longer care about the individual users and the behaviors of the collective are better explained by considering only how the subreddits interact with each other*, functionally "integrating out" the user-level non-equivalences in favor of the abstractions we would get if we treated subreddits as equivalence classes. we're zooming out, similar to a renormalization group operation


**ASSISTANT**

Given your goal of developing notation to discuss emergent behavior in large complex collectives and treating subreddits as equivalence classes, we can consider alternative mathematical frameworks that abstract away individual user-level details. Here, the goal is to capture the macro-level interactions between subreddits. In this context, your idea aligns well with concepts from statistical mechanics, network theory, and coarse-graining techniques.

### Coarse-Graining and Equivalence Classes

Coarse-graining involves grouping micro-level entities (users) into macro-level entities (subreddits) and focusing on the interactions between these macro-level entities. This is similar to the renormalization group approach in physics, where one "integrates out" short-range details to focus on long-range interactions.

### Notation and Framework

1. **Set of Users (\(X\))**:
   - Let \(X\) denote the set of all users.

2. **Set of Subreddits (\(Y\))**:
   - Let \(Y\) denote the set of all subreddits.

3. **User-Subreddit Membership**:
   - Define a relation \(R \subseteq X \times Y\) where \((x, y) \in R\) if user \(x\) is a member of subreddit \(y\).

### Induced Graph Structures

#### Bipartite Graph \(G = (X, Y, E)\)

- **Nodes**: The set \(X \cup Y\), where \(X\) are users and \(Y\) are subreddits.
- **Edges**: An edge \((x, y) \in E\) exists if user \(x \in X\) is a member of subreddit \(y \in Y\).

#### Projected Graph on Subreddits

To capture the emergent behavior by focusing on subreddits and their interactions:

1. **Inter-Subreddit Connectivity Graph \(G' = (Y, E')\)**:
   - **Nodes**: The set \(Y\) representing subreddits.
   - **Edges**: An edge \((y_1, y_2) \in E'\) exists if there is at least one user who is a member of both subreddits \(y_1\) and \(y_2\).

2. **Weighted Graph**:
   - The edge weight \(w(y_1, y_2)\) can be defined as the number of users common to both subreddits \(y_1\) and \(y_2\).

### Quotient-Like Notation

While the traditional quotient notation \(X/Y\) is not directly applicable, we can introduce a notation that conveys the idea of coarse-graining:

1. **Aggregated Subreddit Graph**:
   - Denote the aggregated or coarse-grained graph as \(X \downarrow Y\), indicating the projection from the user level \(X\) to the subreddit level \(Y\).

2. **Interaction Matrix**:
   - Define an interaction matrix \(M\) for the subreddits, where the entry \(M_{ij}\) represents the strength of interaction between subreddit \(i\) and subreddit \(j\).

### Summary

To summarize, you want to abstract away from the individual user level and focus on the collective behavior of subreddits. The notation \(X \downarrow Y\) (or similar) indicates this coarse-graining process, where interactions at the user level are integrated out to reveal emergent behaviors at the subreddit level. The inter-subreddit connectivity graph \(G' = (Y, E')\) and the interaction matrix \(M\) provide concrete tools to analyze these macro-level interactions.

### Proposed Notation

- **Aggregated Graph**: \(G' = (Y, E')\)
- **Interaction Matrix**: \(M\)
- **Coarse-Graining Process**: \(X \downarrow Y\)

By using these tools and notation, you can effectively discuss the emergent behaviors and interactions within the large complex collective of Reddit, focusing on how subreddits interact while abstracting away the complexities at the individual user level.
