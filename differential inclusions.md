### Differential Inclusions

**Differential inclusions** generalize ordinary differential equations (ODEs) by allowing the derivative of a system’s state to belong to a set of possible values rather than being determined by a single function. This framework is particularly useful for modeling systems with uncertainty, non-determinism, or constraints, where the evolution of the state is not uniquely specified.

---

### Formal Definition

A **differential inclusion** is expressed as:
$$
\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) \in F(\mathbf{x}(t)),
$$
where:
- \( \mathbf{x}(t) \in \mathbb{R}^n \): State vector of the system at time \( t \).
- \( F: \mathbb{R}^n \to 2^{\mathbb{R}^n} \): A set-valued map that assigns to each state \( \mathbf{x} \) a set \( F(\mathbf{x}) \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n \).

In contrast to ODEs, where the derivative \( \dot{\mathbf{x}} \) is a single-valued function, here it is an element of the set \( F(\mathbf{x}) \).

---

### Solutions to Differential Inclusions

A function \( \mathbf{x}(t) \) is a solution to the differential inclusion if:
1. \( \mathbf{x}(t) \) is absolutely continuous (i.e., differentiable almost everywhere).
2. At almost every \( t \), the derivative satisfies \( \dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) \in F(\mathbf{x}(t)) \).

---

### Examples of Differential Inclusions

1. **Set-Valued Control Systems:**
   In control theory, the dynamics of a system may depend on a control input \( \mathbf{u}(t) \) belonging to a set \( U \):
   $$
   \dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) \in \{ f(\mathbf{x}(t), \mathbf{u}) : \mathbf{u} \in U \}.
   $$

2. **Non-Smooth Systems:**
   A bouncing ball may be modeled using a differential inclusion to account for the discontinuity at impact:
   $$
   \dot{\mathbf{x}} \in 
   \begin{cases} 
   f_1(\mathbf{x}) & \text{if above the surface}, \\ 
   f_2(\mathbf{x}) & \text{during contact}.
   \end{cases}
   $$

3. **Uncertainty and Robust Control:**
   Systems with uncertain dynamics can use differential inclusions to represent ranges of possible derivatives:
   $$
   \dot{\mathbf{x}} \in [f_1(\mathbf{x}), f_2(\mathbf{x})].
   $$

---

### Properties of Differential Inclusions

#### 1. **Existence of Solutions**
The existence of solutions to a differential inclusion is guaranteed under conditions like:
- \( F(\mathbf{x}) \) is **non-empty**, **closed**, and **convex**.
- \( F(\mathbf{x}) \) satisfies a **Lipschitz-type growth condition**:
  $$
  \| F(\mathbf{x}) - F(\mathbf{y}) \| \leq L \| \mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y} \|.
  $$

#### 2. **Uniqueness of Solutions**
Unlike ODEs, differential inclusions may have multiple solutions, depending on the structure of \( F(\mathbf{x}) \). Uniqueness is typically not guaranteed unless \( F \) has special properties (e.g., single-valued or contractive behavior).

---

### Geometric Interpretation

In a differential inclusion, the map \( F(\mathbf{x}) \) defines a **field of sets** rather than a vector field:
- At each point \( \mathbf{x} \), the derivative \( \dot{\mathbf{x}} \) can point in any direction within the set \( F(\mathbf{x}) \).
- Solutions trace trajectories that "follow" the sets \( F(\mathbf{x}) \) over time.

---

### Applications of Differential Inclusions

1. **Control Theory**
   - [[Viability Theory]]: Used to model systems constrained to stay within certain regions of the state space.
   - Robust control: Captures uncertain dynamics and control constraints.

2. **Optimization**
   - Time-dependent systems where constraints define possible trajectories.
   - Applications in transportation, energy systems, and logistics.

3. **Mechanical Systems**
   - Non-smooth dynamics like friction or impacts (e.g., Coulomb friction or rigid-body collisions).

4. **Epidemiology and Biology**
   - Systems with population dynamics where growth rates are bounded within intervals.

5. **Game Theory**
   - Modeling players' strategies in systems with multiple feasible actions at each time step.

---

### Mathematical Tools for Differential Inclusions

#### 1. **Set-Valued Analysis**
Differential inclusions rely heavily on the theory of set-valued maps, which generalize functions to maps assigning sets to inputs.

#### 2. **Filippov Solutions**
Filippov regularization extends differential inclusions to discontinuous systems, smoothing out jumps in the dynamics.

#### 3. **Viability Kernels**
For systems with constraints, the viability kernel identifies states from which solutions can remain within the desired region.

---

### Example Problem

Suppose a system is modeled as:
$$
\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) \in \{ \mathbf{v} : \|\mathbf{v}\| \leq 1 \}.
$$

This describes a system where the state moves at most with unit speed. The trajectories will stay within the unit ball of velocities at any given point, allowing for a family of potential solutions.

### Differential Inclusions

Differential inclusions generalize ordinary differential equations (ODEs) by allowing the derivative of a function to belong to a set of possible values. This framework is particularly useful for modeling systems with nonsmooth dynamics, discontinuities, or when there is uncertainty in the model.

### Definition

A differential inclusion is an expression of the form:
$$
\dot{x}(t) \in F(t, x(t))
$$
where \( x(t) \in \mathbb{R}^n \) is the state vector, \( t \) is the time variable, and \( F: \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^n \to 2^{\mathbb{R}^n} \) is a set-valued map that assigns to each \((t, x)\) a set \( F(t, x) \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n \).

### Examples

1. **Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)**:
   If \( F(t, x) = \{f(t, x)\} \) where \( f: \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n \) is a single-valued function, the differential inclusion reduces to an ODE:
   $$
   \dot{x}(t) = f(t, x(t))
   $$

2. **Set-Valued Dynamics**:
   If \( F(t, x) = \{v \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid \|v\| \leq 1\} \), the differential inclusion describes a system where the derivative \( \dot{x}(t) \) is constrained to lie within a unit ball.

3. **Control Systems**:
   In control theory, a differential inclusion can model the set of possible control actions. For example, \( F(t, x) = \{Ax + Bu \mid u \in U\} \), where \( U \) is a set of admissible controls.

### Solution Concepts

#### Filippov Solution

A Filippov solution generalizes the concept of a classical solution to handle discontinuities and non-uniqueness. The differential inclusion \( \dot{x}(t) \in F(t, x(t)) \) is interpreted using the Filippov set-valued map:
$$
\mathcal{F}[F](t, x) = \bigcap_{\delta > 0} \bigcap_{\mu(S) = 0} \overline{\text{conv}}\left\{ F(t, y) \mid y \in B(x, \delta) \setminus S \right\}
$$
where \( B(x, \delta) \) is a ball of radius \( \delta \) around \( x \) and \( S \) is a set of measure zero.

#### Carathéodory Solution

A function \( x(t) \) is a Carathéodory solution if:
1. \( x(t) \) is absolutely continuous.
2. For almost all \( t \), \( \dot{x}(t) \in F(t, x(t)) \).

### Existence and Uniqueness Theorems

1. **Filippov’s Existence Theorem**:
   If \( F(t, x) \) is upper semicontinuous in \( x \) and measurable in \( t \), and \( F(t, x) \) is non-empty, compact, and convex for all \((t, x)\), then there exists at least one Filippov solution.

2. **Peano’s Existence Theorem for Differential Inclusions**:
   If \( F(t, x) \) is upper semicontinuous and compact-valued, and there exists \( L \in \mathbb{R} \) such that \( \|v\| \leq L(1 + \|x\|) \) for all \( v \in F(t, x) \), then there exists at least one solution.

### Applications

#### Optimal Control

In optimal control, differential inclusions are used to model systems where the control variable can take values in a set. This approach allows for the formulation of control problems with state constraints and control constraints.

#### Mechanical Systems with Impacts

Systems with impacts, such as a bouncing ball, are naturally modeled using differential inclusions. The set-valued map accounts for the instantaneous change in velocity upon impact.

#### Robust Control

In robust control, differential inclusions model uncertainties in the system dynamics. The set-valued map represents all possible system behaviors under uncertainty.

### Example: Linear Differential Inclusion

Consider the linear differential inclusion:
$$
\dot{x}(t) \in Ax(t) + B(t)U
$$
where \( A \) is a constant matrix, \( B(t) \) is a time-dependent matrix, and \( U \) is a set of admissible controls. The solution \( x(t) \) must satisfy the inclusion for almost all \( t \).

### Conclusion

Differential inclusions provide a powerful framework for modeling and analyzing systems with nonsmooth dynamics, discontinuities, and uncertainties. They extend classical differential equations to accommodate set-valued mappings, offering a rich theory and broad applications in fields like control theory, optimal control, and dynamical systems.
