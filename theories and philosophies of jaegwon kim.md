theories and philosophies of Jaegwon Kim


**ASSISTANT**

Jaegwon Kim was a prominent philosopher in the philosophy of mind and metaphysics, known for his influential work on mental causation, supervenience, and the mind-body problem. Kim's theories address some of the most pressing issues in the philosophy of mind, particularly the relationship between mental and physical properties and the causal efficacy of mental states.

### Key Theories and Philosophies of Jaegwon Kim

#### 1. Supervenience

Supervenience is a central concept in Kim's philosophy, particularly in understanding the relationship between mental and physical properties.

- **Definition**: Mental properties supervene on physical properties if there cannot be a change in mental properties without a corresponding change in physical properties.
- **Weak Supervenience**: If A-properties (e.g., mental properties) supervene on B-properties (e.g., physical properties), then any two individuals that are identical in their B-properties are identical in their A-properties within the same possible world.
- **Strong Supervenience**: This extends weak supervenience to all possible worlds, not just within the same world.
- **Global Supervenience**: The distribution of A-properties in the world depends on the distribution of B-properties globally.

Kim used supervenience to argue for a dependence relationship between mental and physical properties, suggesting that mental properties are not ontologically independent of physical properties.

#### 2. The Mind-Body Problem and Reductionism

Kim is well-known for his work on the mind-body problem, especially his arguments concerning the reducibility of mental states to physical states.

- **Reductionism**: Kim argues for a form of reductionism where mental properties can be reduced to physical properties. He believes that if mental properties are to have causal powers, they must be reducible to physical properties.
- **Local Reduction**: Kim advocates for local reduction, where specific mental phenomena are reduced to specific physical phenomena, rather than a global reduction of all mental phenomena to physical phenomena.

#### 3. The Problem of Mental Causation

Kim extensively addressed the problem of mental causation, which concerns how mental states can cause physical events in a world that seems to be causally closed under physical laws.

- **Causal Exclusion Argument**: Kim argues that if every physical event that has a cause has a sufficient physical cause, then there seems to be no room for mental causes to exert any additional causal influence. This leads to the problem of causal exclusion, where mental causation seems redundant or excluded by physical causation.
- **Overdetermination**: Kim rejects the idea that mental and physical causes can overdetermine their effects because this would lead to an implausible scenario where every event is causally overdetermined.

#### 4. Non-Reductive Physicalism and Its Challenges

Kim has critically examined [[non-reductive physicalism]], a position that tries to maintain the causal efficacy of mental states without reducing them to physical states.

- **Supervenience and Non-Reduction**: While supervenience supports a dependency relationship between mental and physical properties, Kim argues that it does not explain how mental properties can have causal powers without being reducible to physical properties.
- **Exclusion Problem for Non-Reductive Physicalism**: Kim argues that [[non-reductive physicalism]] faces the exclusion problem, where if physical causation is sufficient, it is unclear how mental causation can be anything other than epiphenomenal (i.e., causally inert).

#### 5. Supervenient Causation

Kim proposes the idea of supervenient causation to address some of the issues related to mental causation.

- **Supervenient Causation**: Mental properties can have causal effects if they supervene on physical properties that have causal powers. However, this view still faces challenges in explaining how supervenient properties can exert causal influence independently of their base properties.

#### 6. Functional Reduction

Kim's notion of functional reduction attempts to provide a framework where mental properties can be reduced to physical properties based on their functional roles.

- **Functional Reduction**: Mental properties are identified by their causal roles, and these roles can be realized by physical properties. This allows for the reduction of mental properties to physical properties based on their functional realization.

### Conclusion

Jaegwon Kim's work significantly shapes contemporary debates in the philosophy of mind. His concepts of supervenience, reductionism, and the problem of mental causation address the complex relationship between mental and physical properties. By critically examining [[non-reductive physicalism]] and proposing solutions like supervenient causation and functional reduction, Kim provides a rigorous framework for understanding how mental states can be causally efficacious in a physical world. His contributions continue to influence discussions on the nature of mind, consciousness, and their place in the physical universe.
