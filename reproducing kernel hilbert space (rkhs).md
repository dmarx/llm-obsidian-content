## Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS)

A [[Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space]] (RKHS) is a Hilbert space of functions where evaluation at any point can be performed using an inner product with a special function called a reproducing kernel. RKHS theory combines elements of functional analysis and probability, and it is particularly significant in machine learning, especially in kernel methods and Gaussian processes.

### Definition

Let \( \mathcal{H} \) be a Hilbert space of functions defined on a set \( \mathcal{X} \). \( \mathcal{H} \) is a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space if there exists a function \( k: \mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R} \) (or \( \mathbb{C} \)) such that:

1. **Reproducing Property**:
   For all \( x \in \mathcal{X} \) and all \( f \in \mathcal{H} \),
   $$
   f(x) = \langle f, k(\cdot, x) \rangle_{\mathcal{H}}
   $$

2. **Kernel Property**:
   The function \( k(x, y) \) has the property that for all \( x, y \in \mathcal{X} \),
   $$
   k(x, y) = \overline{k(y, x)}
   $$
   and \( k(\cdot, x) \in \mathcal{H} \) for all \( x \in \mathcal{X} \).

### Properties

#### Positive Definite Kernel

The function \( k \) is called a **positive definite kernel** if for any finite set of points \( \{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\} \subset \mathcal{X} \), the Gram matrix \( K \) defined by \( K_{ij} = k(x_i, x_j) \) is positive semidefinite. This means that for any \( \alpha \in \mathbb{R}^n \),
$$
\alpha^T K \alpha = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n \alpha_i \alpha_j k(x_i, x_j) \geq 0.
$$

#### Moore-Aronszajn Theorem

The Moore-Aronszajn Theorem guarantees that for any positive definite kernel \( k \), there exists a unique RKHS \( \mathcal{H} \) of functions on \( \mathcal{X} \) for which \( k \) is the reproducing kernel.

### Examples

1. **Gaussian (RBF) Kernel**:
   $$ k(x, y) = \exp\left(-\frac{\|x - y\|^2}{2\sigma^2}\right) $$
   This kernel is widely used in machine learning, particularly in Support Vector Machines and Gaussian Processes.

2. **Linear Kernel**:
   $$ k(x, y) = \langle x, y \rangle $$
   This kernel corresponds to the standard inner product in the feature space and is used in linear regression and linear SVM.

3. **Polynomial Kernel**:
   $$ k(x, y) = (\langle x, y \rangle + c)^d $$
   This kernel allows polynomial regression in higher-dimensional spaces.

### Applications

1. **Machine Learning**:
   - **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)**: Kernel methods enable SVMs to find non-linear decision boundaries by mapping input data into a higher-dimensional space where it is easier to separate using a linear hyperplane.
   - **Kernel PCA**: Kernel Principal Component Analysis generalizes PCA to nonlinear dimensionality reduction using kernel functions.

2. **Gaussian Processes**:
   Gaussian Processes use kernels to define the covariance function of the process, allowing flexible, non-parametric regression models.

3. **Function Approximation**:
   RKHS is used in various interpolation and approximation problems where functions are approximated based on their values at given points.

### Mathematical Formalism

#### Inner Product and Norm

The inner product in an RKHS \( \mathcal{H} \) is denoted \( \langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle_{\mathcal{H}} \), and the associated norm is \( \|f\|_{\mathcal{H}} = \sqrt{\langle f, f \rangle_{\mathcal{H}}} \).

#### Constructing RKHS from a Kernel

Given a positive definite kernel \( k \), the RKHS \( \mathcal{H} \) can be constructed as the completion of the space of finite linear combinations of the form \( \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i k(\cdot, x_i) \) with respect to the inner product:

$$
\left\langle \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i k(\cdot, x_i), \sum_{j=1}^m \beta_j k(\cdot, y_j) \right\rangle_{\mathcal{H}} = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^m \alpha_i \beta_j k(x_i, y_j).
$$
