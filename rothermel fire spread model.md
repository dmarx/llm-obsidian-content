Rothermel fire spread model


**ASSISTANT**

The **Rothermel fire spread model** is a semi-empirical mathematical framework used to estimate the rate of spread of wildfires based on fuel properties, topography, and environmental conditions like wind and moisture. It was developed by Richard Rothermel in 1972 and remains one of the foundational tools in wildfire behavior modeling.

## General Equation

The rate of fire spread (\(R\)) in the Rothermel model is expressed as:

$$
R = \frac{I \cdot \xi}{\rho_b \cdot \epsilon}
$$

Where:

- **\(R\)**: Forward rate of fire spread (m/s or ft/min)
- **\(I\)**: Fireline intensity or the rate of energy release per unit length of fire front (kW/m)
- **\(\xi\)**: Propagating flux ratio, representing the fraction of energy contributing to preheating and ignition of unburned fuel
- **\(\rho_b\)**: Bulk density of the fuel bed (kg/m³)
- **\(\epsilon\)**: Effective heat of pre-ignition (J/kg), which is the amount of energy required to raise the unburned fuel to ignition temperature

---

## Components of the Model

### 1. **Fireline Intensity (\(I\))**
The fireline intensity is proportional to the energy output of the fire and is influenced by the heat content of the fuel, its mass, and the rate of spread. It is given by:

$$
I = h \cdot w \cdot R
$$

Where:
- **\(h\)**: Heat content of the fuel (J/kg or BTU/lb)
- **\(w\)**: Fuel loading (mass of fuel per unit area, kg/m² or lb/ft²)
- **\(R\)**: Rate of spread (m/s or ft/min)

### 2. **Fuel Properties**
The fuel characteristics significantly influence fire behavior:
- **Surface area-to-volume ratio (\(\sigma\))**: Determines how quickly the fuel heats and ignites.
- **Moisture content**: Affects fuel flammability and combustion efficiency.
- **Packing ratio (\(\beta\))**: Ratio of fuel bulk density to its maximum possible density, influencing oxygen availability and heat transfer.

### 3. **Wind and Slope Effects**
The model incorporates the influence of wind and slope on the fire's spread. These effects increase the forward rate of spread by enhancing heat transfer and pre-ignition heating.

#### Wind Adjustment
The contribution of wind is modeled using an empirical adjustment factor:

$$
R_w = R_0 \cdot \exp(k_w \cdot U)
$$

Where:
- **\(R_w\)**: Wind-adjusted rate of spread
- **\(R_0\)**: No-wind rate of spread
- **\(k_w\)**: Empirical wind constant based on fuel type
- **\(U\)**: Wind speed (m/s)

#### Slope Adjustment
Slope accelerates fire spread because heat rises uphill, preheating fuel above the fire:

$$
R_s = R_0 \cdot \exp(k_s \cdot \tan\theta)
$$

Where:
- **\(R_s\)**: Slope-adjusted rate of spread
- **\(k_s\)**: Empirical slope constant
- **\(\theta\)**: Slope angle (radians)

---

## Final Rate of Spread

The final rate of spread combines the no-wind/no-slope rate (\(R_0\)) with the wind (\(R_w\)) and slope (\(R_s\)) components:

$$
R = R_0 + R_w + R_s
$$

This simplified summation assumes that wind and slope effects are additive. In some cases, more complex formulations might apply to account for interaction effects.

## Applications

1. **Fire Behavior Prediction**:
   - Widely used in wildfire management tools like BEHAVE and FARSITE.
   - Helps estimate fire spread rate, intensity, and potential impact areas.

2. **Fuel Treatment Planning**:
   - Determines the effectiveness of fuel reduction strategies (e.g., controlled burns, thinning).

3. **Incident Management**:
   - Provides real-time guidance for firefighting operations.

The Rothermel model is foundational but has limitations, including its focus on steady-state conditions and exclusion of dynamic processes like spotting and atmospheric feedback. Modern extensions and computational tools incorporate these complexities for enhanced accuracy.
