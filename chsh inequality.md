CHSH inequality


**ASSISTANT**

The CHSH inequality, named after John Clauser, Michael Horne, Abner Shimony, and Richard Holt, is a fundamental result in quantum mechanics that tests the concept of local hidden variables in quantum systems. This inequality is a specific instance of Bell's inequalities, which were designed to distinguish between quantum mechanics and classical physics theories that are based on local realism.

## Background and Setup

Consider two observers, Alice and Bob, who perform measurements on a pair of entangled particles. Each observer can choose between two measurement settings. Let \( A_1 \) and \( A_2 \) represent Alice's possible measurements, and \( B_1 \) and \( B_2 \) represent Bob's possible measurements. The outcomes of these measurements are binary, typically taken as \( \pm 1 \).

### Classical Expectation

In a local hidden variable theory, the results of measurements are determined by some hidden variable \( \lambda \), with the outcomes for Alice and Bob given by functions \( A_i(\lambda) \) and \( B_j(\lambda) \) respectively. The key assumption of local realism is that the outcome of Alice's measurement depends only on her setting and the hidden variable, and similarly for Bob.

The correlation function in this classical framework is given by:

$$
E(A_i, B_j) = \int_{\Lambda} \rho(\lambda) A_i(\lambda) B_j(\lambda) d\lambda
$$

where \( \rho(\lambda) \) is the probability distribution over the hidden variables.

### CHSH Inequality

The CHSH inequality combines these correlations to form an expression that must satisfy:

$$
|E(A_1, B_1) + E(A_1, B_2) + E(A_2, B_1) - E(A_2, B_2)| \leq 2
$$

### Quantum Mechanical Expectation

In quantum mechanics, the measurement outcomes are determined by the state of the system and the measurement operators. Suppose the system is in a state \( |\psi\rangle \). Alice's and Bob's measurement settings correspond to operators \( \hat{A}_1, \hat{A}_2 \) and \( \hat{B}_1, \hat{B}_2 \) respectively. The correlation function is given by the expectation value:

$$
E(A_i, B_j) = \langle \psi | \hat{A}_i \otimes \hat{B}_j | \psi \rangle
$$

### Violating the CHSH Inequality

Quantum mechanics predicts that there are states and measurement settings for which the CHSH inequality is violated. For example, consider the maximally entangled state (Bell state):

$$
|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|00\rangle + |11\rangle)
$$

If Alice and Bob choose their measurement operators as:

$$
\hat{A}_1 = \sigma_x, \quad \hat{A}_2 = \sigma_z, \quad \hat{B}_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (\sigma_x + \sigma_z), \quad \hat{B}_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (\sigma_x - \sigma_z)
$$

where \( \sigma_x \) and \( \sigma_z \) are the Pauli matrices, then the quantum correlation functions can be computed, leading to:

$$
|E(A_1, B_1) + E(A_1, B_2) + E(A_2, B_1) - E(A_2, B_2)| = 2\sqrt{2}
$$

This exceeds the classical bound of 2, demonstrating the non-classical nature of quantum correlations.

## Implications

The violation of the CHSH inequality by quantum mechanics implies that no local hidden variable theory can fully describe the predictions of quantum mechanics. This result is a cornerstone of quantum information theory and has profound implications for our understanding of reality, locality, and entanglement.
