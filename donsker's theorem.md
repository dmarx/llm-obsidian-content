Donsker's Theorem


**ASSISTANT**

Donsker's Theorem, also known as the Invariance Principle, is a fundamental result in the theory of empirical processes and [[functional central limit theorems]]. It establishes that the empirical process, which is the scaled difference between the empirical distribution function and the true distribution function, converges in distribution to a Brownian bridge.

### Statement of Donsker's Theorem

Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots$ be i.i.d. random variables with cumulative distribution function $F$. The empirical distribution function $F_n$ is defined as:
$$ F_n(x) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \mathbf{1}_{(-\infty, x]}(X_i). $$

The empirical process $\mathbb{G}_n$ is defined by:
$$ \mathbb{G}_n(x) = \sqrt{n} \left( F_n(x) - F(x) \right). $$

Donsker's Theorem states that the empirical process $\mathbb{G}_n$ converges in distribution to a Brownian bridge $B_F$ in the space of cadlag functions with the uniform topology:
$$ \mathbb{G}_n \rightsquiggle B_F \quad \text{in} \quad l^\infty(-\infty, \infty), $$

where $B_F$ is the Brownian bridge defined by:
$$ B_F(x) = W(F(x)) - F(x) W(1), $$

and $W$ is a standard Brownian motion on $[0,1]$.

### Key Concepts

#### 1. **Brownian Bridge**

The Brownian bridge $B(t)$ is a Gaussian process with mean 0 and covariance function:
$$ \text{Cov}(B(s), B(t)) = s(1 - t) \quad \text{for} \quad 0 \leq s \leq t \leq 1. $$

In terms of standard Brownian motion $W(t)$, the Brownian bridge can be expressed as:
$$ B(t) = W(t) - t W(1). $$

#### 2. **Empirical Process**

The empirical process $\mathbb{G}_n(x) = \sqrt{n} (F_n(x) - F(x))$ measures the scaled deviation of the empirical distribution function from the true distribution function.

#### 3. **Functional Central Limit Theorem**

Donsker's Theorem is a type of Functional Central Limit Theorem (FCLT) that extends the classical central limit theorem to stochastic processes.

### Proof Sketch

The proof of Donsker's Theorem involves several key steps and techniques from [[empirical process theory]] and functional analysis.

1. **Finite-Dimensional Convergence**:
   Show that for any finite set of points $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_k$, the finite-dimensional distributions of $\mathbb{G}_n$ converge to those of the Brownian bridge.

2. **Tightness**:
   Prove tightness of the sequence of empirical processes $\{\mathbb{G}_n\}$ in the space of cadlag functions with the uniform topology. Tightness ensures that any subsequence has a further subsequence that converges in distribution.

3. **Application of Prokhorov's Theorem**:
   Use Prokhorov's Theorem to argue that the sequence $\{\mathbb{G}_n\}$ has a weakly convergent subsequence.

4. **Characterization of the Limit**:
   Identify the limit process as the Brownian bridge by verifying that it satisfies the same finite-dimensional distributions and covariance structure.

### Applications

#### 1. **Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test**

The Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic is based on the supremum of the empirical process:
$$ D_n = \sup_x |\mathbb{G}_n(x)|. $$
Donsker's Theorem implies that under the null hypothesis, $D_n$ converges in distribution to the supremum of a Brownian bridge:
$$ D_n \rightsquiggle \sup_{0 \leq t \leq 1} |B(t)|. $$

#### 2. **Consistency of Empirical Processes**

Donsker's Theorem provides a theoretical foundation for the uniform convergence of empirical processes, which is essential in the consistency analysis of nonparametric estimators and hypothesis tests.

#### 3. **Bootstrap Methods**

In the bootstrap method, resampling from the empirical distribution approximates the sampling distribution of a statistic. Donsker's Theorem justifies the use of the empirical process to derive asymptotic properties of bootstrap estimates.

### Extensions and Generalizations

#### 1. **Multivariate Empirical Processes**

Donsker's Theorem has been extended to multivariate settings, where the empirical process is defined for multivariate data and converges to a multivariate Brownian bridge.

#### 2. **Functional Donsker's Theorem**

For more general classes of functions, the empirical process indexed by a class of functions $\mathcal{F}$ can be studied. If $\mathcal{F}$ satisfies certain entropy conditions, the empirical process $\mathbb{G}_n(f)$ converges to a Gaussian process $\mathbb{G}(f)$.
