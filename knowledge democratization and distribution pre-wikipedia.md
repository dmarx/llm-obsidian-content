**ASSISTANT**

The democratization and distribution of knowledge before Wikipedia involved several key phases and innovations throughout history. Here's an overview of how knowledge was shared and made accessible prior to the advent of Wikipedia:

### Ancient and Medieval Periods

1. **Oral Traditions:**
   - **Scope:** Knowledge was passed down orally through stories, songs, and oral teachings.
   - **Examples:** Greek philosophers like Socrates taught orally; epic poems like Homer's *Iliad* and *Odyssey* were memorized and recited.

2. **Manuscripts and Scrolls:**
   - **Scope:** Written records on papyrus, parchment, and vellum.
   - **Examples:** The Library of Alexandria housed numerous scrolls; medieval monasteries meticulously copied manuscripts.

### Renaissance and Enlightenment

1. **Printing Press:**
   - **Invention:** Introduced by Johannes Gutenberg in the mid-15th century.
   - **Impact:** Mass production of books, pamphlets, and other printed materials.
   - **Examples:** Gutenberg Bible; widespread dissemination of Martin Luther's theses.

2. **Academies and Universities:**
   - **Establishment:** Formal institutions for higher learning and research.
   - **Examples:** University of Bologna (founded in 1088), University of Oxford (12th century), Royal Society (founded in 1660).

### 18th and 19th Centuries

1. **Encyclopedias and Reference Works:**
   - **Creation:** Comprehensive compilations of knowledge.
   - **Examples:** Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert’s *Encyclopédie* (1751-1772), Encyclopædia Britannica (first published in 1768).

2. **Public Libraries:**
   - **Development:** Institutions that provided public access to books and other resources.
   - **Examples:** Boston Public Library (founded in 1848), the Library of Congress (established in 1800).

### 20th Century

1. **Radio and Television:**
   - **Scope:** Mass media that broadcasted educational programs and news.
   - **Examples:** BBC, National Public Radio (NPR), educational TV programs like PBS's *Nova*.

2. **Early Digital Databases:**
   - **Development:** Digital archives and databases began to appear.
   - **Examples:** Project Gutenberg (1971), an early effort to digitize and make freely available classic literature; electronic journal databases like JSTOR (founded in 1995).

### Pre-Wikipedia Digital Knowledge Sharing

1. **Usenet and Bulletin Board Systems (BBS):**
   - **Usenet:** Established in 1980, it allowed users to post and read messages in newsgroups.
   - **BBS:** Provided a way for users to connect and share files and messages over dial-up connections.

2. **Early Web Directories and Encyclopedias:**
   - **Directories:** Sites like Yahoo! Directory (1994) categorized and linked to various web resources.
   - **Digital Encyclopedias:** Britannica Online (1994), Encarta by Microsoft (1993).

### Conclusion

The journey towards the democratization and distribution of knowledge has been marked by significant milestones, each contributing to the accessibility and dissemination of information. The advent of the printing press, the establishment of public libraries and universities, the emergence of mass media, and the development of digital databases laid the groundwork for the eventual creation of Wikipedia. Each innovation played a crucial role in making knowledge more accessible to a broader audience, culminating in the comprehensive and collaborative platform that Wikipedia represents today.
