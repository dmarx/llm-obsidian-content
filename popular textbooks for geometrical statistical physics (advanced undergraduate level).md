## Recommended Study Approach

For advanced undergraduates approaching geometrical statistical physics:

1. **Foundation Stage**: 
   - Begin with Sethna for statistical physics concepts with geometric intuition
   - Simultaneously study McCleary to develop differential geometry foundations
   - Work through computational examples to build intuition

2. **Core Development**:
   - Progress to Amari's "Information Geometry and Its Applications"
   - Study Tarrida's "Thermodynamics: A Geometrical Approach"
   - Focus on understanding the connection between thermodynamic potentials and geometry

3. **Specialization**:
   - Choose specialized texts based on interest (field theory, inference, etc.)
   - Implement geometrical algorithms (e.g., [[natural gradient descent]], [[Hamiltonian Monte Carlo]]) computationally

4. **Advanced Integration**:
   - Tackle more mathematically demanding texts like Amari & Nagaoka
   - Connect to research topics like [[spin glasses]], [[neural networks]], or [[quantum information]]

The ideal approach combines theoretical study with computational implementation, using software packages like [[JAX]], [[PyTorch]], or specialized libraries for geometric sampling and inference.
