**ASSISTANT**

Homotopy is a central concept in topology, a branch of mathematics concerned with the properties of space that are preserved under continuous transformations. The notion of homotopy provides a formal way to understand when two mathematical objects can be considered "equivalent" or "the same" in a topological sense, by allowing one object to be continuously deformed into another. This concept is foundational not only in topology but also in areas of mathematics and physics where the idea of continuous deformation is relevant, such as in the study of [[Homotopy Type Theory]] and [[algebraic topology]].

### Formal Definition

Two continuous functions $f, g: X \rightarrow Y$ between topological spaces $X$ and $Y$ are said to be **homotopic** if there is a continuous function $H: X \times [0, 1] \rightarrow Y$ (called a homotopy) such that for every point $x \in X$:
- $H(x, 0) = f(x)$
- $H(x, 1) = g(x)$

The function $H$ provides a continuous path of points in $Y$ for each point in $X$, showing how $f(x)$ can be continuously transformed into $g(x)$. The parameter in $[0, 1]$ often represents "time," with $H(x, t)$ showing the intermediate stages of the transformation from $f$ to $g$.

### Importance and Applications

- **Topological Invariance**: Homotopy is a way of classifying spaces and maps up to deformation, which is more flexible than rigid geometric shapes. Two spaces that are homotopy equivalent (there exist continuous maps between them that are homotopic to the identity map) share many topological properties, such as their fundamental groups and higher homotopy groups.

- **Fundamental Group**: The set of all loops (closed paths) at a point in a space, modulo homotopy, forms a group structure known as the fundamental group. This group captures information about the space's "holes" or loops that cannot be contracted to a point.

- **Higher Homotopy Groups**: While the fundamental group deals with loops, higher homotopy groups generalize this idea to spheres of higher dimensions, providing further information about the space's structure.

- **[[Homotopy Type Theory]]**: In HoTT, homotopy is a key idea, where types are viewed as spaces and equalities as paths. This leads to a rich interplay between logic, mathematics, and computer science, offering new ways to think about proofs, programs, and constructions in mathematics.

### Homotopy vs. Isotopy

It's worth noting the distinction between homotopy and isotopy, another concept of equivalence. Isotopy is a stricter form of equivalence applicable in differential topology and geometry, where the deformation between objects must preserve not just the continuity but also the smooth structure of the space. In contrast, homotopy requires only continuity, making it a more general notion.

Homotopy provides a powerful lens through which to understand and classify spaces based on their essential shape, rather than their precise geometric details, reflecting the core idea in topology that sometimes, being "essentially the same" is more significant than being "exactly the same."

**ASSISTANT**

Homotopy groups are fundamental concepts in algebraic topology, providing a powerful algebraic tool to study and classify topological spaces based on their higher-dimensional loop structures. These groups encapsulate information about how spaces can be continuously deformed, offering insights into the spaces' intrinsic topological properties.

### Fundamental Group (First Homotopy Group)

The **fundamental group** or the first homotopy group, denoted as $\pi_1(X, x_0)$, is the group of loops based at a point $x_0$ in a space $X$, where two loops are considered equivalent if one can be continuously deformed into the other (homotopy). This group captures information about the space's 1-dimensional hole structures. For example, the fundamental group of a circle $S^1$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}$, the set of integers, reflecting the fact that loops around the circle can wind around any number of times in either direction.

### Higher Homotopy Groups

Higher homotopy groups, denoted $\pi_n(X, x_0)$ for $n > 1$, generalize the concept of the fundamental group to $n$-dimensional spheres. $\pi_n(X, x_0)$ consists of the equivalence classes of maps from the $n$-dimensional sphere $S^n$ into $X$ that fix a base point $x_0$. Like the fundamental group, two such maps are considered equivalent if there exists a continuous family of maps between them, keeping the base point fixed.

- **Second Homotopy Group $\pi_2(X, x_0)$**: This group captures information about "holes" that can trap 2-dimensional spheres. For instance, $\pi_2(S^2) \cong \mathbb{Z}$, indicating that the 2-sphere has a single type of "hole" that can be wrapped around itself in a quantifiable way.

- **Higher Groups $\pi_n(X, x_0)$ for $n > 2$**: These explore the space's structure concerning $n$-dimensional spheres. The higher the value of $n$, the more subtle and complex the captured features of $X$.

### Properties and Applications

- **Abelian Groups**: While the fundamental group $\pi_1$ may be non-Abelian, all higher homotopy groups $\pi_n$ for $n > 1$ are Abelian. This reflects the fact that, in higher dimensions, the way loops (or spheres) wrap around each other doesn't matter in terms of the group operation.

- **Topological Invariants**: Homotopy groups are topological invariants, meaning they are preserved under homeomorphisms (continuous deformations with continuous inverses). They provide a way to classify spaces up to homotopy equivalence, a weaker condition than homeomorphism that still preserves much of the spaces' qualitative structure.

- **Calculating Homotopy Groups**: Computing these groups can be highly nontrivial, especially for higher $n$. The fundamental group $\pi_1$ is often the easiest to determine. For certain spaces like spheres, some homotopy groups are known, but for others, the groups remain a subject of active research.

- **Applications**: Homotopy groups have applications across mathematics and physics. In topology, they are used to prove important theorems like the Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem and the Poincaré Conjecture (for $\pi_2$). In physics, they help in the study of topological defects in materials and the classification of phases of matter in condensed matter physics.

Homotopy groups offer a window into the "shape" of spaces beyond the reach of intuition, revealing the deep and often surprising structure underlying seemingly simple spaces.
