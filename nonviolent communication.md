## Nonviolent Communication

Nonviolent Communication (NVC) is a communication and conflict-resolution process developed by the psychologist Marshall Rosenberg. The method is also referred to as compassionate communication or collaborative communication. Its core premise revolves around fostering empathetic understanding and effective communication to resolve conflicts and enhance relationships. The foundation of NVC lies in its model that focuses on expressing honestly through four components and listening empathetically through four corresponding components.

### The Four Components of NVC

1. **Observations**: The first step in NVC involves making clear observations free of evaluation or judgment. Observations are specific to time and context and are distinguished from interpretations or evaluations. For instance, saying "You did not complete the report on time" rather than "You are always late."

2. **Feelings**: After stating observations, the communicator expresses how they feel about what was observed. This expression of feeling should be a direct emotional response rather than a thought or interpretation. For example, "I feel concerned" instead of "I think you donâ€™t care."

3. **Needs**: This component involves expressing the needs, values, or desires that underlie the feelings. NVC posits that all human actions are attempts to meet universal human needs. Clear articulation of these needs can help prevent misunderstandings. For example, "I need to maintain a predictable schedule."

4. **Requests**: The final component of NVC is making a request for concrete actions that would enrich life without demanding or implying a threat. These requests should be clear, specific, and actionable. For example, "Could you please submit your report by 10 AM tomorrow?"

### Empathetic Listening in NVC

Empathetic listening in NVC mirrors the four components of expression. When listening empathetically, the listener focuses on:

- **Observations** of the other person
- **Feelings** expressed by the other person
- **Needs** underlying these feelings
- **Requests** being made by the speaker

### Application and Philosophy

NVC is applied in various contexts including personal relationships, education, mediation, business, and therapeutic settings. Its underlying philosophy is that human beings are capable of empathy and that conflicts arise when strategies for meeting needs clash. NVC encourages moving away from habitual, automatic responses that stem from cultural conditioning toward responses based on awareness of what is alive in oneself and others. It emphasizes that all human beings share the same basic needs, and our actions are aimed at meeting these needs.

The philosophy of NVC also strongly aligns with certain ethical and philosophical views that emphasize compassion, cooperation, and the intrinsic value of maintaining and nurturing interpersonal connections.

### Mathematical Formalization

While NVC itself does not directly involve mathematical formalization, it aligns with systems theory and game theory in its recognition of interdependent variables (needs, feelings) influencing outcomes in dynamic systems (interpersonal interactions). A game-theoretical analysis might, for example, model communication strategies as cooperative games where the payoff is relational satisfaction or conflict resolution.

NVC can be an invaluable tool for improving interpersonal communication and resolving conflicts, promoting not only the expression of honest feelings and needs but also fostering respect and empathetic engagement.
