**USER**

pure functions


**ASSISTANT**

**Pure functions** are a fundamental concept in [[Functional Programming]] and play a critical role in many programming paradigms due to their predictability, reusability, and testability. A function is considered pure if it satisfies two primary conditions:

1. **Deterministic Output:** The output of a pure function is determined solely by its input values, without observable side effects. Given the same inputs, a pure function will always produce the same output.

2. **No Side Effects:** A pure function does not cause any observable changes in the state of the system or external environment. It does not alter any global variables, perform I/O operations, or modify its input arguments.

### Characteristics of Pure Functions

- **Immutability:** Pure functions often operate on immutable data. Once data is created, it cannot be changed, ensuring that functions cannot alter any external state.

- **Referential Transparency:** A pure function can be replaced with its output value without changing the behavior of the program. This property is known as referential transparency and is a direct result of function purity.

- **Isolation from External Systems:** Since pure functions must not interact with databases, file systems, networks, or perform any other I/O operations, they are isolated from external systems. This isolation makes them highly predictable and stable.

### Advantages of Pure Functions

- **Ease of Testing and Debugging:** Testing pure functions is straightforward since they do not require any setup or cleanup related to external state, and their output can be easily predicted from the input. Debugging is also more manageable because you only need to consider the function's parameters and its code.

- **Enhanced Parallelization:** Pure functions can be executed in parallel without worrying about race conditions or deadlocks since they do not share state with other functions.

- **Reusability and Modularity:** Pure functions increase reusability due to their independence from the program's state. They can be thought of as self-contained modules that can be plugged into different parts of a program or even different programs.

- **Simplification of Code Reasoning:** The absence of side effects and the deterministic nature of pure functions simplify reasoning about code. This clarity benefits long-term maintenance and understanding of the codebase.

### Examples

Hereâ€™s a simple example in Haskell, which emphasizes pure functions:

```haskell
-- A pure function that computes the square of a number
square :: Int -> Int
square x = x * x

-- A pure function that calculates the sum of squares of two numbers
sumOfSquares :: Int -> Int -> Int
sumOfSquares a b = square a + square b
```

In these examples, both `square` and `sumOfSquares` are pure functions. They depend only on their inputs to compute the outputs and do not modify any external state.

### Use in Larger Contexts

While pure functions are a cornerstone of functional programming, their benefits are recognized in other programming paradigms as well. Many modern languages encourage the use of pure functions to some degree. In imperative languages like JavaScript, adopting a more functional style with pure functions can lead to clearer and more maintainable code:

```javascript
// JavaScript pure function example
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

### Conclusion

Pure functions form the backbone of functional programming and bring substantial benefits to software development by enhancing reliability, maintainability, and scalability of code. Their properties make them an essential tool for constructing robust applications, particularly in environments that demand high concurrency or where deterministic behavior is critical.
