Zeeman Effect


**ASSISTANT**

The Zeeman effect describes the splitting of atomic energy levels in the presence of an external magnetic field. This phenomenon provides important insights into the interaction between magnetic fields and atomic structures and is used extensively in spectroscopy, quantum mechanics, and various applications in physics and engineering.

### Key Concepts

1. **Magnetic Moment and Angular Momentum**:
   The magnetic moment \(\vec{\mu}\) of an electron in an atom is related to its angular momentum \(\vec{J}\) by:
   $$
   \vec{\mu} = -g_J \mu_B \vec{J}
   $$
   where \(g_J\) is the Landé g-factor, \(\mu_B\) is the Bohr magneton, and \(\vec{J}\) is the total angular momentum operator.

2. **Hamiltonian in a Magnetic Field**:
   When an atom is placed in an external magnetic field \(\vec{B}\), the interaction energy (Zeeman Hamiltonian) is given by:
   $$
   \hat{H}_{\text{Zeeman}} = -\vec{\mu} \cdot \vec{B} = g_J \mu_B \vec{J} \cdot \vec{B}
   $$
   For simplicity, consider the magnetic field applied along the \(z\)-axis, \(\vec{B} = B_z \hat{z}\). The Hamiltonian then becomes:
   $$
   \hat{H}_{\text{Zeeman}} = g_J \mu_B B_z \hat{J}_z
   $$

3. **Energy Level Splitting**:
   The Zeeman effect causes the degenerate energy levels corresponding to different magnetic quantum numbers \(m_J\) to split. The energy shift for a state with quantum numbers \((n, l, J, m_J)\) is:
   $$
   \Delta E = \langle n, l, J, m_J | \hat{H}_{\text{Zeeman}} | n, l, J, m_J \rangle = g_J \mu_B B_z m_J
   $$

### Types of Zeeman Effect

1. **Normal Zeeman Effect**:
   This occurs for transitions where the total spin \(S = 0\). The splitting of spectral lines is symmetric, resulting in three components (triplet) corresponding to \(\Delta m = 0, \pm 1\). The energy shift is given by:
   $$
   \Delta E = m_l \mu_B B
   $$
   where \(m_l\) is the magnetic quantum number of the orbital angular momentum \(l\).

2. **Anomalous Zeeman Effect**:
   This occurs when the total spin \(S \neq 0\). The splitting is more complex due to the additional spin contribution. The number of components depends on the values of \(J\) and \(m_J\).

### Example Calculation: Hydrogen Atom in a Magnetic Field

Consider the hydrogen atom in a magnetic field \(B_z\). The Hamiltonian without the magnetic field is:
$$
\hat{H}_0 = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 - \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r}
$$
In the presence of a magnetic field, the total Hamiltonian is:
$$
\hat{H} = \hat{H}_0 + \hat{H}_{\text{Zeeman}} = \hat{H}_0 + g_J \mu_B B_z \hat{J}_z
$$

For the ground state of hydrogen, \(n = 1\), \(l = 0\), and \(m_l = 0\). The spin quantum number \(s = \frac{1}{2}\), so the total angular momentum \(J = \frac{1}{2}\), with \(m_J = \pm \frac{1}{2}\). The Landé g-factor for an electron in the \(1s\) state is:
$$
g_J = 2
$$

The energy shifts due to the Zeeman effect are:
$$
\Delta E = g_J \mu_B B_z m_J = 2 \mu_B B_z m_J
$$

For \(m_J = \frac{1}{2}\):
$$
\Delta E_+ = 2 \mu_B B_z \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) = \mu_B B_z
$$

For \(m_J = -\frac{1}{2}\):
$$
\Delta E_- = 2 \mu_B B_z \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right) = -\mu_B B_z
$$

Thus, the originally degenerate ground state splits into two levels with energy shifts \(\pm \mu_B B_z\).

### Selection Rules and Spectral Lines

The selection rules for electric dipole transitions (\(\Delta l = \pm 1\), \(\Delta m = 0, \pm 1\)) determine the allowed transitions between split levels. For instance, in the normal Zeeman effect, the transition between two levels can produce three lines:
- **π-line**: \(\Delta m = 0\)
- **σ^+-line**: \(\Delta m = +1\)
- **σ^--line**: \(\Delta m = -1\)

### Conclusion

The Zeeman effect is a powerful tool for probing the interaction between magnetic fields and atomic structures. By analyzing the splitting of spectral lines, one can gain insights into the magnetic properties of atoms, the structure of atomic energy levels, and the underlying symmetries. This effect has wide-ranging applications in areas such as atomic spectroscopy, astrophysics, and magnetic resonance techniques.
