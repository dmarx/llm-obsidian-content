# Algorithmic Chemistry

[[Algorithmic chemistry]] is a computational framework for modeling and simulating artificial chemical systems, where symbolic structures (typically strings or graphs) interact according to well-defined transformation rules. This approach bridges [[artificial life]], [[complex systems theory]], and [[theoretical computer science]] to explore the emergence of complexity from simple components and interactions.

## Mathematical Foundations

### Basic Formalism

An algorithmic chemistry can be formally defined as a tuple:

$$\mathcal{A} = \langle \Sigma, R, A \rangle$$

Where:
- $\Sigma$ is a finite alphabet of symbols
- $R$ is a set of reaction rules
- $A$ is a set of axioms or initial objects

### Reaction Rules

Reaction rules typically take the form:

$$s_1 + s_2 + ... + s_n \rightarrow t_1 + t_2 + ... + t_m$$

Where $s_i, t_j \in \Sigma^*$ are strings over the alphabet.

In a more general formulation, each rule $r \in R$ can be represented as a function:

$$r: \Sigma^* \times \Sigma^* \times ... \times \Sigma^* \rightarrow \mathcal{P}(\Sigma^*)$$

Where $\mathcal{P}(\Sigma^*)$ is the power set of all possible strings, allowing for non-deterministic outcomes.

## Types of Algorithmic Chemistries

### String-Based Systems

#### Lambda Calculus Chemistry

Based on [[lambda calculus]], where molecules are λ-expressions and reactions are β-reductions:

$$(\lambda x.e_1)e_2 \rightarrow e_1[x := e_2]$$

The [[combinatory logic]] variant uses combinators like $S$ and $K$ with rules:
- $Kxy \rightarrow x$
- $Sxyz \rightarrow xz(yz)$

#### AlChemy

[[AlChemy]] (Algorithmic Chemistry) by Fontana uses λ-expressions as molecules with collision rules:

$$a + b \rightarrow a(b)$$

Where $a(b)$ represents the application of expression $a$ to expression $b$.

### Graph-Based Systems

#### Artificial Chemistries on Graphs

Molecules are represented as labeled graphs $G = (V, E, L)$ with:
- $V$ as vertices
- $E \subseteq V \times V$ as edges
- $L: V \rightarrow \Sigma$ as a labeling function

Reaction rules transform subgraph patterns:

$$p: G_1 \rightarrow G_2$$

Where $p$ identifies an occurrence of pattern $G_1$ and replaces it with $G_2$.

#### Chemical Organization Theory

[[Chemical organization theory]] analyzes the structure of reaction networks, defining a [[chemical organization]] as a set of molecules that is:
- [[Closed]]: No reaction produces molecules outside the set
- [[Self-maintaining]]: Every consumed molecule can be produced at sufficient rate

Formally, for organization $O$:
- $\forall r \in R, \text{inputs}(r) \subseteq O \Rightarrow \text{outputs}(r) \subseteq O$
- $\exists \mathbf{v} \geq \mathbf{0}: \mathbf{S}\mathbf{v} \geq \mathbf{0}$

Where $\mathbf{S}$ is the [[stoichiometric matrix]] and $\mathbf{v}$ is a flux vector.

## Computational Universality

Many algorithmic chemistries are [[Turing complete]], meaning they can simulate any computable function. This is typically shown by embedding a universal computational model:

- For λ-calculus chemistries: inherently Turing complete
- For rewriting systems: simulating [[tag systems]] or [[cellular automata]]

The [[halting problem]] applies to questions about the long-term behavior of most algorithmic chemistries.

## Dynamical Properties

### Mass-Action Kinetics

The dynamics of high-population algorithmic chemistries often follow [[mass-action kinetics]]:

$$\frac{d[S_i]}{dt} = \sum_j v_{ij} r_j \prod_k [S_k]^{n_{jk}}$$

Where:
- $[S_i]$ is the concentration of species $i$
- $v_{ij}$ is the stoichiometric coefficient
- $r_j$ is the rate constant for reaction $j$
- $n_{jk}$ is the order of reaction with respect to species $k$

### Attractors and Stability

Algorithmic chemistries exhibit complex [[dynamical system]] behaviors:

- [[Fixed points]]: Stable collections of molecules
- [[Limit cycles]]: Oscillatory behavior in chemical concentrations
- [[Strange attractors]]: Chaotic dynamics with sensitive dependence on initial conditions

The [[omega-limit set]] of an algorithmic chemistry represents its long-term behavior:

$$\omega(x) = \{y \in X : \exists \text{ sequence } t_n \rightarrow \infty \text{ with } \phi^{t_n}(x) \rightarrow y\}$$

Where $\phi^t$ is the time evolution operator.

## Emergence and Self-Organization

### Autocatalytic Sets

An [[autocatalytic set]] is a collection of molecules where each molecule can be produced by at least one reaction catalyzed by another molecule in the set:

$$\forall x \in \mathcal{F}, \exists r \in R: x \in \text{outputs}(r) \land \text{catalysts}(r) \cap \mathcal{F} \neq \emptyset$$

Where $\mathcal{F}$ is the autocatalytic set.

### Hypercycles

[[Hypercycles]] represent higher-order self-replicating structures where molecules catalyze each other's production in a cyclic pattern:

$$E_1 \rightarrow E_2 \rightarrow ... \rightarrow E_n \rightarrow E_1$$

The dynamics can be modeled using [[replicator equations]]:

$$\frac{dx_i}{dt} = x_i(f_i(\mathbf{x}) - \phi(\mathbf{x}))$$

Where $f_i$ is the fitness function and $\phi$ is the average fitness.

## Information-Theoretical Analysis

### Complexity Measures

Several metrics quantify the complexity of algorithmic chemistries:

1. **[[Shannon entropy]]** of the molecular population:
   $$H(P) = -\sum_i p_i \log_2 p_i$$
   Where $p_i$ is the proportion of species $i$.

2. **[[Mutual information]]** between molecular structures:
   $$I(X;Y) = \sum_{x,y} p(x,y) \log_2 \frac{p(x,y)}{p(x)p(y)}$$

3. **[[Logical depth]]** as a measure of organizational complexity:
   $$LD(x) = \min \{t : U(p) = x \text{ in } t \text{ steps, } |p| \leq |p^*| + c\}$$
   Where $U$ is a universal Turing machine and $p^*$ is a minimal program.

### Information Flow

The [[transfer entropy]] between chemical species measures directed information flow:

$$T_{Y \rightarrow X} = \sum p(x_{t+1}, x_t, y_t) \log \frac{p(x_{t+1}|x_t,y_t)}{p(x_{t+1}|x_t)}$$

## Computational Implementations

### Simulation Approaches

1. **[[Stochastic simulation algorithm]]** (Gillespie's algorithm):
   - Choose next reaction probabilistically
   - Update time by exponentially distributed random variable

2. **[[Flux balance analysis]]**:
   - Solve the linear programming problem:
     $$\max \mathbf{c}^T \mathbf{v} \text{ subject to } \mathbf{S}\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{0}, \mathbf{v}_{\min} \leq \mathbf{v} \leq \mathbf{v}_{\max}$$

3. **[[Rule-based modeling]]**:
   - Represent reaction rules symbolically
   - Generate reaction network on-the-fly

### Optimization Challenges

Efficient simulation faces computational challenges:
- [[State space explosion]]: Number of potential molecules grows exponentially
- [[Reaction network inference]]: Discovering possible reactions
- [[Rare event sampling]]: Capturing low-probability but significant reactions

## Applications

- [[Metabolic networks]]
- [[Genetic regulatory systems]]
- [[Evolution of complexity]]

### Origins of Life Research
