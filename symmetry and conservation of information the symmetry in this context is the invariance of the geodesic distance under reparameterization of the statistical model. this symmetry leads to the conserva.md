> Symmetry and Conservation of Information: The symmetry in this context is the invariance of the geodesic distance under reparameterization of the statistical model. This symmetry leads to the conservation of informational relationships along geodesics. Just as Noether's theorem relates symmetries of the action in physical systems to conservation laws (such as energy or momentum), in information geometry, the symmetry under parameter transformations relates to the conservation of information along geodesics.
express this formally. if a lemma in your argument is non-novel, invoke the applicable named theorems associated with the relevant lemma.


**ASSISTANT**

To formalize the relationship between symmetry, conservation of information, and invariance under parameter transformations in the context of information geometry, we draw upon concepts from differential geometry and information theory. This formalization is structured as a theorem-like statement, underpinned by the foundational principles of information geometry and invoking relevant established theorems where applicable.

### Theorem: Conservation of Informational Relationships in Information Geometry

**Given:**
- A statistical manifold \(M\), representing a statistical model with a parameter space \(\Theta\), where each point \(\theta \in \Theta\) corresponds to a probability distribution.
- The Fisher information metric \(g_{ij}(\theta)\) defined on \(M\), providing a Riemannian metric that quantifies the "distance" between probability distributions parameterized by \(\theta\).
- A geodesic \(\gamma(t)\), \(t \in [0,1]\), on \(M\) under the Fisher information metric, representing the path of least information change between two points \(\theta_0\) and \(\theta_1\) in \(\Theta\).

**Lemma (Invariance Under Reparameterization):** The Fisher information metric is invariant under smooth reparameterizations of the statistical model. This is a direct consequence of the **Information Invariance Principle** which states that the information content between probability distributions is invariant under the choice of parameterization.

**Lemma (Geodesic Invariance):** Let \(\phi: \Theta \to \Theta'\) be a smooth reparameterization map. The geodesic distance between two points \(\theta_0\) and \(\theta_1\) in \(\Theta\), given by the length of \(\gamma(t)\) under \(g_{ij}\), is invariant under \(\phi\). This follows from the invariance of the Fisher information metric and is related to the **Levi-Civita Connection** invariance under reparameterizations, ensuring that the connection, and thus the geodesics it defines, are preserved under reparameterizations of the manifold.

**To Prove:** The informational relationship between distributions along a geodesic \(\gamma(t)\) is conserved under reparameterization of the statistical model.

**Proof:**

1. Consider two points \(\theta_0, \theta_1 \in \Theta\) and their corresponding distributions \(P_{\theta_0}\) and \(P_{\theta_1}\).

2. The geodesic \(\gamma(t)\) under the Fisher information metric \(g_{ij}(\theta)\) represents the path of least information change between \(P_{\theta_0}\) and \(P_{\theta_1}\).

3. By the **Invariance Under Reparameterization Lemma**, reparameterizing the model from \(\Theta\) to \(\Theta'\) does not alter the Fisher information metric, and hence the geodesic \(\gamma(t)\) mapped under the reparameterization \(\phi\) remains a geodesic in the new parameter space.

4. Consequently, the informational relationship between \(P_{\theta_0}\) and \(P_{\theta_1}\), quantified by the geodesic distance (integral of the square root of the Fisher information along \(\gamma(t)\)), is preserved under the reparameterization. This is because the geodesic distance, being invariant, conserves the "amount" of information change between \(P_{\theta_0}\) and \(P_{\theta_1}\) regardless of the parameterization used.

5. Thus, we conclude that the symmetry under parameter transformations—manifested as invariance of the Fisher information metric and the preservation of geodesic paths—leads to the conservation of informational relationships along geodesics in \(M\).

**Conclusion:** The conservation of informational relationships along geodesics in information geometry, underpinned by the symmetry of invariance under parameter transformations, formalizes a principle akin to Noether's theorem in the realm of statistical models and information theory. This principle underscores the fundamental role of symmetry in the structure of information spaces, echoing the profound impact of Noether's insights across diverse domains of science and mathematics.
