third order desires


**ASSISTANT**

**Third-order desires** extend **Harry Frankfurt's hierarchy of desires** one level higher and represent a further refinement of our reflective capacities. While **first-order desires** are simple urges (e.g., to eat, to watch pornography), and **second-order desires** involve reflecting on those urges (e.g., the desire to want or not want to act on those urges), **third-order desires** would be desires about second-order desires. This means they reflect a higher level of self-evaluation, where one reflects not just on what they desire, but on their **overall approach** to what kinds of desires they want to have or endorse.

### 1. **Understanding Third-Order Desires**

Third-order desires can be thought of as **meta-reflections** on one's second-order desires. For example, an individual may not only want (or not want) their first-order desires to move them to act, but they might also reflect on whether they approve of the process by which they decide which desires to endorse. This could include reflecting on the **kind of person** they want to be, and whether their second-order desires align with that higher-level self-conception.

#### **Example:**
Consider someone with compulsive pornography use who:
- Has a **first-order desire** to watch pornography.
- Has a **second-order desire** to stop acting on this first-order desire because they believe it’s harmful to them.
- Reflects on whether their **second-order desire** (to stop watching pornography) aligns with their broader, higher-order values or life goals. They might ask themselves whether they are engaging in this reflection in the right way or whether their second-order desires should be different.

Thus, a **third-order desire** might involve a person reflecting on **why** they want to resist pornography (the second-order desire) and whether that reasoning aligns with their **long-term identity, moral framework, or overall sense of self**.

#### **Key Features of Third-Order Desires:**
- **Meta-Evaluation**: Third-order desires involve evaluating one’s process of forming second-order desires and whether one is happy with the way they choose what desires to act upon.
- **Long-Term Identity**: These desires often relate to **long-term goals**, values, or identity (e.g., “I want to be the kind of person who values self-control and moderation in all aspects of life”).
- **Consistency with Moral Framework**: Third-order desires engage with broader **moral, ethical, or existential frameworks**. For example, a person might reflect on whether their second-order desires (e.g., to stop consuming pornography) align with a **higher moral ideal** or **vision of virtue** they hold.

### 2. **Expanding Frankfurt’s Model to Include Third-Order Desires**

While **Harry Frankfurt** stops at **second-order desires** in his formal model of free will, the idea of third-order desires provides an additional level of reflection that can address some of the **criticisms** of Frankfurt’s framework, such as the possibility of **infinite regress**. By recognizing **third-order desires**, we can address questions about how people come to reflect on their second-order desires and what motivates those reflections.

- **Recursive Reflection**: One of the criticisms of Frankfurt’s model is that it could lead to an **infinite regress**—for every second-order desire, you could have a third-order desire about whether you endorse your second-order desire, and so on. However, many philosophers argue that in practice, the process of reflection tends to reach **natural stopping points**. For many individuals, these stopping points occur at the level of **third-order desires**, where they reflect on their **values, identity, and overarching life goals**.

- **Higher-Order Authenticity**: Third-order desires can contribute to a **more nuanced understanding of authenticity**. While Frankfurt defines freedom of will as the alignment between second-order desires and first-order desires, third-order desires allow individuals to evaluate whether their **process of choosing second-order desires** truly reflects their **authentic self**.

### 3. **Third-Order Desires and Moral Responsibility**

Third-order desires might also play a role in **moral responsibility**. A person with well-developed third-order desires might have a deeper sense of **moral agency** because they are capable of reflecting on their entire framework of desires and values.

#### **Example in Moral Decision-Making:**
- A person might have a **first-order desire** to retaliate against someone who hurt them.
- They might have a **second-order desire** to refrain from retaliation because they believe in forgiveness.
- But they could also reflect on their **third-order desire** about why they value forgiveness and how that aligns with their deeper moral principles, such as religious beliefs, empathy, or a commitment to non-violence.

This kind of reflection could strengthen their commitment to their second-order desire, reinforcing their decision not to retaliate, because they see how it fits into their **moral identity**.

### 4. **Third-Order Desires and Personal Identity**

Third-order desires often relate to a person’s **narrative of self**—the story they tell about who they are and who they want to become. People might reflect on whether their **current set of second-order desires** aligns with the **kind of person** they envision themselves being in the long term.

#### **Examples of Third-Order Desires Shaping Identity:**
- **Addiction Recovery**: A person recovering from addiction might not only desire to quit using a substance (second-order desire) but also reflect on the kind of **identity** they are building as a person who values self-control, health, and responsibility (third-order desire).
- **Career and Life Goals**: An individual might reflect on whether their career choices (and the desires that drive those choices) are aligned with their **higher-order desire** to live a fulfilling, meaningful life. They might evaluate whether their ambition and career-driven second-order desires reflect their deeper value of **balance** or **family life**.

By cultivating third-order desires, individuals gain greater control over their **life trajectory**, aligning their day-to-day decisions with their long-term values and overarching sense of purpose.

### 5. **Potential Criticisms and Limits of Third-Order Desires**

While third-order desires add a rich dimension to our understanding of self-reflection and agency, there are several challenges or critiques:
- **Complexity and Infinite Regress**: As mentioned earlier, the possibility of **infinite regress** remains. After third-order desires, what prevents the need for **fourth-order desires**? Some philosophers argue that **practical limits** (like time, cognitive capacity, or context) constrain reflection to a manageable level.
  
- **Practical Utility**: It might be argued that for most people, **second-order reflection** is sufficient. Not everyone needs to engage in third-order desires for their actions to be considered free or autonomous. Some may not find it necessary to reflect at this higher level, or they may lack the cognitive framework to do so.

- **Over-Reflection**: Engaging in too much reflective meta-analysis of desires could lead to **paralysis by analysis**. Constantly questioning every desire could impair an individual's ability to act decisively, leading to **inaction** or **self-doubt**. 

### Conclusion

While Harry Frankfurt's original model focused primarily on **first-order desires** and **second-order volitions**, extending the framework to include **third-order desires** offers a richer understanding of **human agency**, **moral responsibility**, and **personal identity**. Third-order desires allow for deeper reflection on one's values and the kind of person they want to be, enabling individuals to align their desires with **long-term goals** and **moral frameworks**.

By introducing **third-order desires**, we acknowledge that humans not only evaluate their immediate urges and reflect on whether to act on them but also consider whether their **entire process of desire formation** aligns with their **broader values** and **life goals**. This richer hierarchy allows for a more nuanced exploration of **authenticity**, **freedom**, and **moral responsibility**, especially in cases of complex decision-making, addiction, or the struggle for self-mastery.
