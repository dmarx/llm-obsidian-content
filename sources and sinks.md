# Sources and Sinks

In [[dynamical systems]] theory and [[vector field analysis]], sources and sinks represent fundamental types of [[critical points]] or [[equilibrium points]] where the behavior of trajectories exhibits distinct patterns of convergence or divergence.

## Mathematical Formalization

Let $\mathbf{f}: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n$ be a [[vector field]] and consider the autonomous system:

$\dot{\mathbf{x}} = \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x})$

An [[equilibrium point]] $\mathbf{x}_*$ satisfies $\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}_*) = \mathbf{0}$. The local behavior near $\mathbf{x}_*$ is characterized by the [[Jacobian matrix]] $J(\mathbf{x}_*)$ of $\mathbf{f}$ evaluated at the equilibrium point.

### Sources

A source is an equilibrium point where:
- All [[eigenvalues]] of $J(\mathbf{x}_*)$ have positive real parts
- All trajectories near $\mathbf{x}_*$ flow away from the equilibrium
- The equilibrium is [[unstable]]

Formally, there exists an $\epsilon > 0$ such that for any point $\mathbf{p}$ in the $\epsilon$-neighborhood of $\mathbf{x}_*$:

$\lim_{t \to -\infty} \phi_t(\mathbf{p}) = \mathbf{x}_*$

where $\phi_t$ represents the [[flow]] of the vector field.

### Sinks

A sink (or [[attractor]]) is an equilibrium point where:
- All eigenvalues of $J(\mathbf{x}_*)$ have negative real parts
- All nearby trajectories flow toward the equilibrium
- The equilibrium is [[asymptotically stable]]

Formally, there exists an $\epsilon > 0$ such that for any point $\mathbf{p}$ in the $\epsilon$-neighborhood of $\mathbf{x}_*$:

$\lim_{t \to \infty} \phi_t(\mathbf{p}) = \mathbf{x}_*$

## Linear Systems Example

For a 2D linear system:

$\begin{bmatrix} \dot{x} \\ \dot{y} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix}$

The origin is:
- A source if $a + d > 0$ and $ad - bc > 0$
- A sink if $a + d < 0$ and $ad - bc > 0$

## Applications

Sources and sinks appear in numerous applications:
- [[Population dynamics]] where populations either grow unboundedly (source) or decay to extinction (sink)
- [[Chemical reaction networks]] where concentrations approach equilibrium states
- [[Neural dynamics]] where activity patterns either amplify or decay
- [[Control systems]] where stability analysis is crucial for system design

## Relationship to Other Concepts

Sources and sinks are special cases of more general [[hyperbolic equilibrium points]]. They relate to:
- [[Lyapunov stability theory]]
- [[Basin of attraction]]
- [[Stable and unstable manifolds]]
- [[Structural stability]]
- [[Bifurcation theory]]
