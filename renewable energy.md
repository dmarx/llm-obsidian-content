Renewable energy refers to energy sources that are naturally replenished on a human timescale. These sources are considered more sustainable compared to fossil fuels because they produce less pollution and have a virtually inexhaustible supply. Below are key types of renewable energy:

## Solar Energy
Solar energy is harnessed from the sun using technologies such as photovoltaic (PV) panels and solar thermal systems.

### Photovoltaic Systems
PV systems convert sunlight directly into electricity using semiconductor materials. The basic unit of a PV system is the solar cell, which generates electricity through the photovoltaic effect.

$$
P = \eta \times A \times I
$$

where:
- $P$ is the power output,
- $\eta$ is the efficiency of the PV cell,
- $A$ is the area of the PV cell,
- $I$ is the solar irradiance.

### Solar Thermal Systems
These systems use mirrors or lenses to concentrate sunlight into a small area to produce heat, which can be used for power generation or heating.

## Wind Energy
Wind energy is captured using wind turbines, which convert the kinetic energy of wind into mechanical power that can then be converted into electricity.

$$
P = \frac{1}{2} \rho A v^3
$$

where:
- $P$ is the power output,
- $\rho$ is the air density,
- $A$ is the swept area of the turbine blades,
- $v$ is the wind speed.

## Hydropower
Hydropower utilizes the energy of flowing or falling water to generate electricity. This is typically done using dams or run-of-the-river systems.

### Potential Energy
The potential energy of water at height $h$ is given by:

$$
E_p = mgh
$$

where:
- $E_p$ is the potential energy,
- $m$ is the mass of the water,
- $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity,
- $h$ is the height of the water source.

### Kinetic Energy
When water flows, its kinetic energy can be used to turn turbines:

$$
E_k = \frac{1}{2} mv^2
$$

where:
- $E_k$ is the kinetic energy,
- $m$ is the mass flow rate of water,
- $v$ is the velocity of the water.

## Biomass
Biomass energy is derived from organic materials such as plant and animal waste. These materials can be converted into electricity, heat, or biofuels through various processes like combustion, anaerobic digestion, and gasification.

### Combustion Process
Combustion of biomass releases energy, which can be used to produce steam for electricity generation:

$$
C_6H_{10}O_5 + 6O_2 \rightarrow 6CO_2 + 5H_2O + \text{Energy}
$$

where $C_6H_{10}O_5$ represents the general formula for biomass.

## Geothermal Energy
Geothermal energy is derived from the heat stored within the Earth's crust. This energy can be accessed by drilling wells to tap into geothermal reservoirs.

### Heat Extraction
The rate of heat extraction can be modeled as:

$$
Q = m c \Delta T
$$

where:
- $Q$ is the heat energy extracted,
- $m$ is the mass flow rate of the geothermal fluid,
- $c$ is the specific heat capacity of the fluid,
- $\Delta T$ is the temperature change of the fluid.

## Conclusion
Renewable energy sources are critical for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and achieving sustainability. Each type of renewable energy—solar, wind, hydropower, biomass, and geothermal—offers unique advantages and challenges. The choice of technology depends on geographic, economic, and environmental factors. By integrating these energy sources, we can move towards a more resilient and sustainable energy system.
