### Economic Policy Institute (EPI) Study: The High Public Cost of Low Wages

The Economic Policy Institute's 2015 report titled "The High Public Cost of Low Wages" explores how low wages in various industries lead to significant public expenditures on social safety net programs. This report highlights the extent to which taxpayers subsidize low-wage employment, particularly focusing on workers in industries like retail, fast food, and healthcare.

### Key Findings of the Study

1. **Widespread Reliance on Public Assistance:**
   - **Program Enrollment:** The study found that millions of low-wage workers rely on public assistance programs such as Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) to make ends meet.
   - **Industry Focus:** Workers in industries with high concentrations of low-wage jobs, such as retail, fast food, and home healthcare, are particularly dependent on these programs.

2. **Cost to Taxpayers:**
   - **Annual Cost:** The report estimates that low wages cost U.S. taxpayers approximately $153 billion annually in public support for working families.
   - **Breakdown of Costs:** The largest components of these costs include $45 billion for Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), $23 billion for SNAP benefits, $6 billion for TANF, and $41 billion for EITC.

3. **Low-Wage Employers and Public Assistance:**
   - **Corporate Impact:** The study highlights that some of the nation’s largest and most profitable corporations, including Walmart and McDonald’s, have significant numbers of employees who rely on public assistance programs due to low wages and inadequate benefits.
   - **Public Subsidy:** This reliance on public assistance effectively acts as a subsidy for these companies, as taxpayers bear the financial burden of supplementing workers' incomes.

### Implications of the Findings

1. **Economic Inequality:**
   - **Income Disparities:** The dependence on public assistance among low-wage workers exacerbates income inequality, as many employees in profitable companies live in or near poverty.
   - **Corporate Profits vs. Worker Wages:** The disparity between the substantial profits earned by large corporations and the low wages paid to their workers highlights a significant issue in the distribution of economic gains.

2. **Public Expenditure:**
   - **Taxpayer Burden:** The substantial public costs associated with supplementing low wages impose a significant burden on taxpayers, diverting resources that could be used for other public goods or services.
   - **Economic Efficiency:** Subsidizing low wages through public assistance programs can be seen as an inefficient use of public funds, as it supports business models that rely on underpaying workers.

### Policy Recommendations

1. **Raising the Minimum Wage:**
   - **Living Wage Standards:** Increasing the minimum wage to a living wage level can ensure that full-time workers earn enough to support themselves and their families without needing public assistance.
   - **Indexing to Inflation:** Linking the minimum wage to inflation can maintain its purchasing power over time, preventing wage erosion and reducing future reliance on public assistance.

2. **Strengthening Labor Standards:**
   - **Fair Scheduling Practices:** Implementing fair scheduling laws can provide workers with more predictable hours and income, improving their financial stability.
   - **Pro-Rated Benefits:** Requiring employers to provide pro-rated benefits for part-time workers can reduce the gap in benefits between part-time and full-time employees, thereby decreasing reliance on public assistance.

3. **Employer Responsibility Policies:**
   - **Penalty for Low-Wage Employers:** Introducing penalties or taxes on large employers with a significant number of employees relying on public assistance can incentivize higher wages and better benefits.
   - **Disclosure Requirements:** Mandating that large corporations disclose the extent to which their employees rely on public assistance can increase transparency and accountability, encouraging better labor practices.

4. **Expanding Access to Benefits:**
   - **Universal Healthcare:** Implementing universal healthcare coverage can reduce the need for employer-provided health insurance and decrease workers' reliance on Medicaid.
   - **Income Support Programs:** Expanding income support programs, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), can supplement low wages and reduce the need for public assistance.

### Conclusion

The Economic Policy Institute's report on the high public cost of low wages highlights the significant reliance on public assistance among low-wage workers due to inadequate wages and benefits. This reliance imposes a substantial burden on taxpayers and underscores the need for policy reforms to address low wages and improve economic security for workers. Raising the minimum wage, strengthening labor standards, implementing employer responsibility policies, and expanding access to benefits are essential steps to reduce the public subsidy of low-wage work and promote a more equitable and sustainable economy.
