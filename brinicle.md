### Brinicle

A **brinicle**, often referred to as an "ice finger of death," is a rare and fascinating natural phenomenon that occurs under sea ice in polar regions. It forms when extremely cold, saline water (brine) is expelled from the forming sea ice and sinks due to its higher density, creating a descending tube of ice that can freeze everything in its path, including marine life.

### Formation of a Brinicle

1. **Sea Ice Formation**:
   - In polar regions, when seawater freezes, it forms sea ice. However, the process of freezing does not capture all the salt present in seawater. Instead, most of the salt is expelled, creating very cold and highly saline brine.

2. **Brine Rejection**:
   - As sea ice forms, the exclusion of salt leads to the creation of dense, cold brine, which is much saltier and colder than the surrounding seawater. This brine is expelled from the sea ice and begins to sink due to its higher density.

3. **Descending Brine Stream**:
   - The cold, dense brine descends through the water column, but because it is much colder than the surrounding water, it causes the surrounding seawater to freeze. This process forms a hollow tube of ice around the descending brine stream, creating what is known as a **brinicle**.

4. **Ice Tube Formation**:
   - The brinicle continues to grow downward as the brine continues to freeze the surrounding seawater. This descending column of ice can reach the seafloor, where it can cause freezing of the sediment and any organisms present.

### Physical Characteristics of a Brinicle

- **Temperature and Salinity**:
  - The brine that forms a brinicle is typically at a temperature below the freezing point of the surrounding seawater, due to its high salinity. The freezing point of seawater decreases as salinity increases, allowing the brine to remain liquid even at sub-zero temperatures.

- **Structure**:
  - A brinicle is essentially a hollow ice tube that forms around the sinking brine. Inside the tube, brine continues to flow downward, while the outer layer is solid ice. The structure can be fragile and is often only a few centimeters in diameter, though it can grow several meters in length.

- **Formation Speed**:
  - The growth rate of a brinicle depends on the salinity and temperature of the brine, as well as the temperature and currents of the surrounding seawater. Under the right conditions, a brinicle can form and reach the seafloor in a matter of hours.

### Impact on Marine Life

- **Freezing Effect**:
  - As a brinicle descends and reaches the seafloor, it can freeze everything it comes into contact with. This includes small marine organisms, such as sea stars, urchins, and other benthic creatures. The rapid freezing caused by the brinicle can trap these organisms in ice, leading to their death.

- **Ecological Consequences**:
  - While the formation of a brinicle can be lethal to nearby organisms, it is a localized phenomenon and typically does not affect large areas. However, in areas where brinicles form frequently, they could potentially influence the distribution and behavior of benthic communities.

### Observations and Research

- **First Documented Observations**:
  - Brinicles were first observed in the 1960s by divers and scientists studying sea ice in the Arctic and Antarctic. However, they remained poorly understood and rarely observed due to the challenging conditions in which they form.

- **Modern Research and Filming**:
  - Advances in underwater filming and remote sensing technology have allowed scientists to observe and document brinicles more effectively. Notably, a BBC crew captured a brinicle forming on film for the first time during the production of the "Frozen Planet" series in 2011.

- **Laboratory Studies**:
  - Controlled laboratory experiments have been conducted to simulate the formation of brinicles, helping scientists understand the precise conditions under which they form and their potential effects on marine ecosystems.

### Theoretical Considerations

- **Heat and Mass Transfer**:
  - The formation of a brinicle involves complex heat and mass transfer processes, including the rejection of salt during ice formation, the sinking of brine due to its density, and the freezing of surrounding water due to the extremely cold brine.

- **Thermohaline Processes**:
  - Brinicles are an example of thermohaline processes, where variations in temperature and salinity drive the movement of water masses. The study of brinicles can provide insights into similar processes that occur on larger scales in the ocean, such as [[thermohaline circulation]].

### Conclusion

A **brinicle** is a remarkable natural phenomenon that occurs in polar regions under sea ice, where dense, cold brine sinks and freezes the surrounding seawater, forming an ice tube that can extend to the seafloor. While brinicles are rare and localized, they offer a fascinating glimpse into the complex interactions between temperature, salinity, and ocean dynamics. The study of brinicles not only enhances our understanding of polar marine environments but also contributes to our knowledge of thermohaline processes in the ocean.
