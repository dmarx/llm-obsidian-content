# Collective Action Problems

## Overview

[[Collective action problems]] refer to situations where multiple individuals would all benefit from a certain action, but the associated cost makes it implausible that any individual will undertake it alone. Despite the fact that all individuals would be better off if they cooperated to perform the action, self-interested rational individuals may not work towards the common good, creating a gap between individual rationality and collective rationality. The concept, formalized by [[Mancur Olson]] in his 1965 work "The Logic of Collective Action," serves as a cornerstone of [[public choice theory]], [[political economy]], and [[institutional economics]].

## Formal Definition

A collective action problem occurs when:

$$\forall i \in N: U_i(C) > U_i(D) \text{ if } |\{j \in N: j \text{ chooses } C\}| \geq t$$

But:

$$\forall i \in N: U_i(D) > U_i(C) \text{ if } |\{j \in N: j \text{ chooses } C\}| < t$$

Where:
- $N = \{1, 2, ..., n\}$ is the set of individuals
- $U_i$ is individual $i$'s utility function
- $C$ represents cooperation
- $D$ represents defection
- $t$ is a threshold number of cooperators needed

## Mathematical Formulation

### Basic Model

Let $x_i \in [0, 1]$ be individual $i$'s contribution to the collective action.

Individual utility is:

$$U_i(x_i, \mathbf{x}_{-i}) = B_i(X) - C_i(x_i)$$

Where:
- $\mathbf{x}_{-i}$ is the vector of contributions from all individuals except $i$
- $X = \sum_{j=1}^n x_j$ is the total contribution
- $B_i(X)$ is the benefit function
- $C_i(x_i)$ is the cost function

The individual optimization problem is:

$$\max_{x_i \in [0,1]} U_i(x_i, \mathbf{x}_{-i})$$

The first-order condition gives:

$$\frac{\partial B_i(X)}{\partial X} \leq \frac{\partial C_i(x_i)}{\partial x_i}$$

With equality if $x_i > 0$.

### Social Optimum

The social planner's problem is:

$$\max_{\mathbf{x}} \sum_{i=1}^n U_i(x_i, \mathbf{x}_{-i})$$

The first-order condition for social optimality is:

$$\sum_{j=1}^n \frac{\partial B_j(X)}{\partial X} \leq \frac{\partial C_i(x_i)}{\partial x_i}$$

With equality if $x_i > 0$.

The discrepancy between individual and social optima creates the [[free-rider problem]].

## Typology of Collective Action Problems

### 1. By Benefit Structure

#### Public Goods Provision

For a [[public good]] with non-rival, non-excludable benefits:

$$B_i(X) = b_i \cdot v(X)$$

Where $b_i$ is individual $i$'s valuation parameter and $v(X)$ is a concave function of total contribution.

The Nash equilibrium provision level $X^{NE}$ satisfies:

$$\max_{i \in N} \{b_i\} \cdot v'(X^{NE}) = \min_{i \in N} \{c_i\}$$

Where $c_i$ is individual $i$'s marginal cost parameter.

#### Common-Pool Resource Management

For a [[common-pool resource]] with rival, non-excludable benefits:

$$B_i(x_i, X) = x_i \cdot b(X)$$

Where $b(X)$ is a decreasing function of total appropriation.

The Nash equilibrium appropriation level $X^{NE}$ satisfies:

$$b(X^{NE}) + x_i^{NE} \cdot b'(X^{NE}) = c_i$$

#### Club Goods

For [[club goods]] with non-rival, excludable benefits:

$$B_i(X, M) = v(X, M) \cdot \mathbf{1}_{\{i \in M\}}$$

Where $M$ is the set of club members and $\mathbf{1}$ is the indicator function.

### 2. By Game Structure

#### Prisoner's Dilemma

The canonical [[prisoner's dilemma]] structure:

$$\begin{pmatrix}
(R, R) & (S, T) \\
(T, S) & (P, P)
\end{pmatrix}$$

Where $T > R > P > S$ and $2R > T + S$.

#### Stag Hunt

The [[stag hunt]] coordination game:

$$\begin{pmatrix}
(A, A) & (C, B) \\
(B, C) & (D, D)
\end{pmatrix}$$

Where $A > B \geq D > C$.

#### Volunteer's Dilemma

The [[volunteer's dilemma]] where only one volunteer is needed:

$$U_i(x_i, \mathbf{x}_{-i}) = \begin{cases}
v - c & \text{if } x_i = 1 \\
v & \text{if } x_i = 0 \text{ and } \exists j \neq i: x_j = 1 \\
0 & \text{if } x_i = 0 \text{ and } \forall j \neq i: x_j = 0
\end{cases}$$

Where $v > c > 0$.

#### Chicken Game

The [[chicken game]] or [[hawk-dove game]]:

$$\begin{pmatrix}
(-C, -C) & (V, 0) \\
(0, V) & (0, 0)
\end{pmatrix}$$

Where $V > 0$ and $C > V$.

### 3. By Scale

#### Local Collective Action

Interactions within smaller groups where:

$$U_i(x_i, \mathbf{x}_{-i}) = B_i(X) - C_i(x_i) + S_i(\mathbf{x})$$

Where $S_i$ represents social preferences or norms.

#### Global Collective Action

Large-scale problems where:

$$U_i(x_i, \mathbf{x}_{-i}) = B_i(X) - C_i(x_i)$$

With minimal direct interaction between participants.

## Factors Affecting Collective Action

### 1. Group Size

Olson's formulation of the size effect:

$$P_i = \frac{B_i(X)}{X} \cdot \frac{\partial X}{\partial x_i} - \frac{\partial C_i(x_i)}{\partial x_i}$$

Where $P_i$ is the net benefit from contribution.

As group size increases, typically $\frac{\partial X}{\partial x_i} \to 1$ and $\frac{B_i(X)}{X} \to 0$.

### 2. Heterogeneity

Effect of asymmetric interests:

$$B_i(X) = \alpha_i \cdot B(X)$$
$$C_i(x_i) = \beta_i \cdot C(x_i)$$

Where $\alpha_i$ and $\beta_i$ vary across individuals.

The participation condition becomes:

$$\alpha_i \cdot \frac{\partial B(X)}{\partial X} \geq \beta_i \cdot \frac{\partial C(x_i)}{\partial x_i}$$

### 3. Excludability

Selective incentives:

$$U_i(x_i, \mathbf{x}_{-i}) = B_i(X) - C_i(x_i) + S_i(x_i)$$

Where $S_i(x_i)$ represents selective benefits that are conditional on contribution.

### 4. Repetition

In infinitely repeated interactions, cooperation can be sustained if:

$$\delta \geq \frac{U_i(D, C) - U_i(C, C)}{U_i(D, C) - U_i(D, D)}$$

Where $\delta$ is the discount factor.

### 5. Information and Monitoring

Imperfect monitoring creates moral hazard:

$$P(\text{observed } x_i | \text{actual } x_i) = \begin{cases}
1 - \epsilon & \text{if observed } x_i = \text{actual } x_i \\
\epsilon & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

Where $\epsilon$ is the error probability.

## Solutions to Collective Action Problems

### 1. Institutional Solutions

#### Centralized Enforcement

Government provision through taxation:

$$T_i = \tau_i \cdot Y_i$$

Where $T_i$ is individual $i$'s tax contribution, $\tau_i$ is the tax rate, and $Y_i$ is income.

#### Property Rights

Transforming common-pool resources into private goods:

$$B_i(x_i) - C_i(x_i)$$

Eliminating the externality.

#### Regulation

Setting limits on individual behavior:

$$x_i \leq \bar{x}_i$$

Where $\bar{x}_i$ is the regulatory limit.

### 2. Market-Based Solutions

#### Coasean Bargaining

Under the [[Coase theorem]], with zero transaction costs and well-defined property rights:

$$\exists \mathbf{x}^*: \sum_{i=1}^n U_i(\mathbf{x}^*) \geq \sum_{i=1}^n U_i(\mathbf{x}) \forall \mathbf{x}$$

#### Pigouvian Taxation

Setting taxes equal to marginal external costs:

$$\tau_i = \sum_{j \neq i} \frac{\partial B_j(X)}{\partial X}$$

#### Cap and Trade

Creating marketable rights:

$$\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \leq X^*$$

Where $X^*$ is the socially optimal level.

### 3. Self-Governance Solutions

#### Norms and Social Preferences

Incorporating other-regarding preferences:

$$U_i(x_i, \mathbf{x}_{-i}) = B_i(X) - C_i(x_i) + \gamma_i \sum_{j \neq i} U_j(x_j, \mathbf{x}_{-j})$$

Where $\gamma_i$ represents the weight placed on others' welfare.

#### Reciprocity

Conditional cooperation:

$$x_i = f\left(\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{j \neq i} x_j\right)$$

Where $f$ is an increasing function.

#### Monitoring and Sanctioning

Peer punishment:

$$U_i(x_i, \mathbf{x}_{-i}, \mathbf{p}) = B_i(X) - C_i(x_i) - \sum_{j \neq i} p_{ji} - \sum_{j \neq i} c_{ij}(p_{ij})$$

Where $p_{ji}$ is punishment imposed on $i$ by $j$ and $c_{ij}(p_{ij})$ is the cost to $i$ of punishing $j$.

## Advanced Models and Extensions

### 1. Evolutionary Dynamics

Replicator dynamics:

$$\dot{p}_s = p_s \left[ \pi_s(\mathbf{p}) - \sum_{s' \in S} p_{s'} \pi_{s'}(\mathbf{p}) \right]$$

Where $p_s$ is the proportion of strategy $s$ and $\pi_s(\mathbf{p})$ is its payoff.

### 2. Network Effects

Contribution decisions on networks:

$$U_i(x_i, \mathbf{x}_{N(i)}) = B_i\left(x_i + \sum_{j \in N(i)} x_j\right) - C_i(x_i)$$

Where $N(i)$ is the set of $i$'s neighbors.

### 3. Threshold Models

Critical mass dynamics:

$$x_i = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } \sum_{j \neq i} x_j \geq \theta_i \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

Where $\theta_i$ is individual $i$'s threshold.

### 4. Mechanism Design

Designing incentive-compatible mechanisms:

$$\max_{\mathcal{M}} \mathbb{E}_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\left[\sum_{i=1}^n U_i(x_i(\boldsymbol{\theta}), \mathbf{x}_{-i}(\boldsymbol{\theta}), t_i(\boldsymbol{\theta}))\right]$$

Subject to incentive compatibility and participation constraints.

## Applications

### 1. Environmental Problems

#### Climate Change Mitigation

National contributions to emissions reduction:

$$U_i(x_i, \mathbf{x}_{-i}) = B_i(X) - C_i(x_i)$$

Where $X$ represents global emissions reduction.

The [[Paris Agreement]] attempts to solve this through [[Nationally Determined Contributions]].

#### Fisheries Management

The [[Gordon-Schaefer model]]:

$$\frac{dS}{dt} = G(S) - \sum_{i=1}^n h_i$$

Where $S$ is stock, $G(S)$ is natural growth, and $h_i$ is harvest by agent $i$.

Solutions include [[Individual Transferable Quotas]] (ITQs).

### 2. Political Participation

#### Voting

The paradox of voting:

$$U_i(\text{vote}) = P_i \cdot B - C$$

Where $P_i$ is the probability that $i$'s vote is decisive, $B$ is the benefit from preferred outcome, and $C$ is the cost of voting.

Typically $P_i \approx 0$ in large elections.

#### Social Movements

Participation dynamics:

$$x_i = f(X_{-i}, V, R)$$

Where $V$ is the value of success and $R$ is the risk of participation.

### 3. Economic Coordination

#### Public Infrastructure

Funding and maintenance:

$$U_i(x_i, \mathbf{x}_{-i}) = v_i \cdot G(X) - c_i \cdot x_i$$

Where $G(X)$ is the quality of infrastructure.

#### Innovation Commons

Knowledge production:

$$U_i(x_i, \mathbf{x}_{-i}) = \alpha_i \cdot K(X) - c_i \cdot x_i$$

Where $K(X)$ is accumulated knowledge.

Solutions include [[patent pools]] and [[open-source licensing]].

# Collective Action Problems

## Overview

[[Collective action problems]] arise when rational individual behavior leads to outcomes that are suboptimal for the group as a whole. These problems occur when individuals have incentives to [[free ride]] on others' contributions to public goods or common pool resources, resulting in [[underprovision]] of benefits or [[overexploitation]] of shared resources despite mutual gains from cooperation being theoretically possible.

## Mathematical Framework

### General Collective Action Model

Consider $N$ individuals where individual $i$ chooses contribution level $c_i \in [0, C_{\max}]$ to a collective good. The payoff function for individual $i$ is:

$$\pi_i(c_i, c_{-i}) = f\left(\sum_{j=1}^N c_j\right) - g(c_i)$$

where:
- $f(\cdot)$ represents the [[benefit function]] from the collective good
- $g(\cdot)$ represents the [[private cost function]] of contribution
- $c_{-i} = (c_1, ..., c_{i-1}, c_{i+1}, ..., c_N)$ represents others' contributions

### Nash Equilibrium Analysis

Individual $i$'s optimal contribution satisfies the [[first-order condition]]:

$$\frac{\partial \pi_i}{\partial c_i} = f'\left(\sum_{j=1}^N c_j^*\right) - g'(c_i^*) = 0$$

This yields the [[reaction function]]:

$$c_i^* = \arg\max_{c_i} \left[f\left(c_i + \sum_{j \neq i} c_j^*\right) - g(c_i)\right]$$

### Social Optimum vs. Nash Equilibrium

The [[social optimum]] maximizes total welfare:

$$\max_{\{c_i\}} \sum_{i=1}^N \pi_i = N \cdot f\left(\sum_{j=1}^N c_j\right) - \sum_{i=1}^N g(c_i)$$

The first-order condition for social optimum:

$$N \cdot f'\left(\sum_{j=1}^N c_j^{SO}\right) = g'(c_i^{SO}) \quad \forall i$$

The [[efficiency gap]] is:

$$\Delta W = \sum_{i=1}^N \pi_i(c^{SO}) - \sum_{i=1}^N \pi_i(c^{NE}) > 0$$

## Canonical Examples

### Public Goods Provision

For pure public goods with [[linear cost structure]]:

$$\pi_i = \alpha \ln\left(\sum_{j=1}^N c_j\right) - c_i$$

Nash equilibrium contribution:

$$c_i^{NE} = \frac{\alpha}{N} - \frac{1}{N}\sum_{j \neq i} c_j^{NE}$$

Symmetric equilibrium: $c_i^{NE} = \frac{\alpha}{N+1}$ for all $i$

Social optimum: $c_i^{SO} = \frac{\alpha}{2}$ for all $i$

The [[underprovision ratio]]:

$$\frac{c^{NE}}{c^{SO}} = \frac{2}{N+1} \to 0 \text{ as } N \to \infty$$

### Common Pool Resource Problem

Consider $N$ agents extracting from a common resource with total stock $S$. Individual $i$'s extraction $e_i$ yields:

$$\pi_i = p(E) \cdot e_i - c(e_i)$$

where $E = \sum_{j=1}^N e_j$ is total extraction and $p(E)$ is the [[resource price function]] (decreasing in total extraction).

Nash equilibrium condition:

$$p(E^{NE}) + e_i^{NE} \cdot p'(E^{NE}) = c'(e_i^{NE})$$

Social optimum condition:

$$p(E^{SO}) + E^{SO} \cdot p'(E^{SO}) = c'(e_i^{SO})$$

Since $p'(E) < 0$, we have $E^{NE} > E^{SO}$ (overextraction).

## Factors Affecting Collective Action

### Group Size Effects

The [[group size paradox]] shows that larger groups face more severe collective action problems:

$$\frac{\partial c_i^{NE}}{\partial N} < 0$$

This occurs because:
1. Individual benefit share $\frac{1}{N}$ decreases
2. Free-riding incentives increase
3. Coordination becomes more difficult

### Heterogeneity Impact

With heterogeneous valuations $\alpha_i$, individual contributions become:

$$c_i^{NE} = \frac{\alpha_i - \bar{\alpha}}{N+1} + \frac{\bar{\alpha}}{N+1}$$

where $\bar{\alpha} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=1}^N \alpha_j$.

The [[variance decomposition]]:

$$\text{Var}(c^{NE}) = \frac{\text{Var}(\alpha)}{(N+1)^2}$$

High heterogeneity can either help (if high-valuation individuals contribute more) or hurt (if inequality breeds resentment).

### Repeated Interaction Effects

In infinitely repeated games with discount factor $\delta$, cooperation can be sustained if:

$$\delta \geq \delta^* = \frac{c^{SO} - c^{NE}}{f(\sum c^{SO}) - f(\sum c^{NE}) + c^{SO} - c^{NE}}$$

The [[sustainability threshold]] $\delta^*$ decreases with:
- Smaller efficiency gains from cooperation
- Higher individual contribution costs
- Greater punishment severity for defection

## Network Effects

### Spatial Collective Action

When agents are embedded in networks, payoffs become:

$$\pi_i = \sum_{j \in N_i} w_{ij} f(c_j) - g(c_i)$$

where $N_i$ is $i$'s neighborhood and $w_{ij}$ are [[network weights]].

Equilibrium contributions:

$$c_i^* = \arg\max_{c_i} \left[\sum_{j \in N_i} w_{ij} f(c_j^*) - g(c_i)\right]$$

### Strategic Complementarity vs. Substitutability

Actions are [[strategic complements]] when:

$$\frac{\partial^2 \pi_i}{\partial c_i \partial c_j} > 0$$

This occurs when $f''(\cdot) > 0$, leading to [[multiple equilibria]] and potential [[coordination problems]].

Actions are [[strategic substitutes]] when:

$$\frac{\partial^2 \pi_i}{\partial c_i \partial c_j} < 0$$

This is typical in pure public goods ($f''(\cdot) = 0$ or $< 0$).

## Institutional Solutions

### Coercive Mechanisms

#### Taxation and Mandatory Contribution

Government can solve the problem through:

$$c_i = \tau_i \quad \text{with penalty } P \text{ for non-compliance}$$

Optimal tax satisfies:

$$\sum_{i=1}^N \tau_i = \arg\max \sum_{i=1}^N \left[f\left(\sum_{j=1}^N \tau_j\right) - \tau_i\right]$$

#### Regulation and Command

Direct regulation sets contribution requirements:

$$c_i \geq c_{\min} \quad \text{or} \quad c_i \in [c_{\min}, c_{\max}]$$

### Market-Based Solutions

#### Pigouvian Subsidies

Subsidize contributions at rate $s$ per unit:

$$\pi_i = f\left(\sum_{j=1}^N c_j\right) - g(c_i) + s \cdot c_i$$

Optimal subsidy rate:

$$s^* = (N-1) \cdot f'\left(\sum_{j=1}^N c_j^{SO}\right)$$

#### Tradeable Permits

Create [[property rights]] for resource extraction:

- Issue $Q$ permits where $Q = E^{SO}$
- Allow trading at price $p$
- Individual optimization: $p = c'(e_i)$

### Contractual Solutions

#### Side Payments and Compensation

[[Lindahl pricing]] where individual $i$ pays price $p_i$ per unit of public good:

$$p_i = \frac{\partial f(\sum c_j)}{\partial (\sum c_j)} \quad \text{such that} \quad \sum_{i=1}^N p_i = \text{marginal cost}$$

#### Voluntary Agreements

[[Covenant communities]] where members agree to contribution rules with:
- Entry/exit rights
- Monitoring mechanisms
- Graduated sanctions

## Self-Governance Solutions

### Ostrom's Design Principles

Successful [[common pool resource management]] often incorporates:

1. **Clearly Defined Boundaries**: $N_{\text{members}}$ and resource scope
2. **Congruence Rules**: Benefits proportional to costs
3. **Collective Choice**: Participation in rule-making
4. **Monitoring**: $P(\text{detection}) > \theta_{\min}$
5. **Graduated Sanctions**: $S(\text{violation count})$ increasing
6. **Conflict Resolution**: Low-cost dispute mechanisms
7. **Recognition**: External authority acknowledges legitimacy
8. **Nested Institutions**: Multiple governance levels

### Social Norms and Reciprocity

[[Conditional cooperation]] strategies:

$$c_i(t+1) = \begin{cases}
c^{coop} & \text{if } \frac{1}{N-1}\sum_{j \neq i} c_j(t) \geq c^{threshold} \\
c^{defect} & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

### Reputation Mechanisms

In repeated interactions with reputation:

$$R_i(t+1) = \rho R_i(t) + (1-\rho) \cdot \text{Cooperation Level}_i(t)$$

Future cooperation depends on reputation:

$$P(\text{cooperate with } i) = \Phi(\alpha R_i - \beta)$$

## Communication and Coordination

### Cheap Talk Effects

Pre-play communication can improve outcomes when:

$$\pi_i(\text{message}, \text{action}) = \pi_i(\text{action}) - \epsilon \cdot \mathbb{1}[\text{message} \neq \text{action}]$$

The [[truth-telling constraint]]:

$$\epsilon > \max_{\text{action}} |\pi_i(\text{truth}) - \pi_i(\text{action})|$$

### Focal Points and Conventions

[[Schelling points]] can coordinate behavior:

$$c_i^* = \arg\max_{c_i} \pi_i(c_i, c_{-i}^*) \quad \text{where} \quad c_{-i}^* \text{ is focal}$$

Common focal points include:
- Equal contributions: $c_i = c_j$ for all $i,j$
- Proportional to capacity: $c_i \propto \text{Capacity}_i$
- Traditional/historical levels

## Empirical Measurement

### Laboratory Experiments

Standard [[public goods games]]:
- Initial endowment $E$
- Contribution choice $c_i \in [0, E]$
- Payoff: $\pi_i = (E - c_i) + \alpha \sum_{j=1}^N c_j$
- Measure: $\frac{\text{Average Contribution}}{\text{Social Optimum}}$

### Field Experiments

Natural experiments measuring:
- Voting turnout (public good of democracy)
- Charitable giving (public good provision)
- Environmental conservation behaviors
- Community organization participation

### Observational Studies

Cross-sectional analysis:

$$\text{Collective Action Success} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \mathbf{X}_{\text{group}} + \beta_2 \mathbf{X}_{\text{institutional}} + \epsilon$$

Time series analysis:

$$\frac{d(\text{Cooperation})}{dt} = f(\text{Group Characteristics}, \text{Institutional Quality}, \text{External Shocks})$$

## Applications Across Domains

### Environmental Problems

#### Climate Change

Global emissions reduction as collective action:

$$\text{Damage}_i = D\left(\sum_{j=1}^N E_j\right) \quad \text{where} \quad \frac{\partial D}{\partial E_j} > 0$$

Individual country's problem:

$$\max_{E_i} \text{Benefit}(E_i) - \text{Abatement Cost}(E_i) - \text{Damage}_i$$

#### Local Environmental Goods

Air quality, watershed protection, biodiversity conservation:

$$Q = f\left(\sum_{i=1}^N a_i\right) \quad \text{where} \quad a_i \text{ is conservation effort}$$

### Political Participation

#### Voting

Voting as collective action with:
- Cost: $c$ (time, information gathering)
- Benefit: $B \cdot P(\text{vote decisive}) \approx \frac{B}{N}$
- Paradox: $c > \frac{B}{N}$ for large $N$

#### Collective Protest

Revolution/social movement participation:

$$\pi_i = \text{Benefit if Success} \cdot P(\text{Success}) - \text{Participation Cost}$$

where $P(\text{Success})$ increases with total participation.

### Organizational Behavior

#### Team Production

Firm with team production:

$$Y = f\left(\sum_{i=1}^N e_i\right) \quad \text{shared among } N \text{ workers}$$

Individual payoff:

$$w_i = \frac{Y}{N} - c(e_i)$$

Nash equilibrium effort below social optimum.

#### Knowledge Sharing

R&D consortiums where:

$$\text{Innovation}_i = g(k_i + \beta \sum_{j \neq i} k_j) - c(k_i)$$

where $k_i$ is knowledge investment and $\beta < 1$ represents [[knowledge spillovers]].

## Dynamic Collective Action

### Learning and Adaptation

Agents update strategies based on experience:

$$c_i(t+1) = c_i(t) + \alpha \left[\pi_i(t) - \bar{\pi}(t)\right] \frac{\partial \pi_i}{\partial c_i}$$

### Evolutionary Dynamics

Population-level evolution of cooperation:

$$\frac{dx}{dt} = x(1-x)[\pi_C(x) - \pi_D(x)]$$

where $x$ is fraction of cooperators and $\pi_C, \pi_D$ are cooperative and defection payoffs.

### Threshold Models

[[Critical mass models]] where cooperation spreads once:

$$\sum_{i: c_i > 0} \alpha_i \geq \theta_{\text{critical}}$$

### Path Dependence

Historical success affects future cooperation:

$$P(\text{cooperation at } t) = f(\text{Success History}, \text{Current Incentives})$$

## Cultural and Psychological Factors

### Social Preferences

#### Altruism

Utility includes others' welfare:

$$U_i = \pi_i + \gamma \sum_{j \neq i} \pi_j$$

Optimal contribution:

$$c_i^* = \arg\max_{c_i} [\pi_i + \gamma \sum_{j \neq i} \pi_j]$$

#### Inequity Aversion

Disutility from inequality:

$$U_i = \pi_i - \alpha_i \sum_{j \neq i} \max(0, \pi_j - \pi_i) - \beta_i \sum_{j \neq i} \max(0, \pi_i - \pi_j)$$

#### Reciprocity

Conditional cooperation based on others' behavior:

$$c_i = \max(0, \min(C_{\max}, \rho \cdot \bar{c}_{-i} + \epsilon_i))$$

### Cultural Dimensions

Cross-cultural variation in collective action success:

$$\text{Success Rate} = f(\text{Individualism}, \text{Trust}, \text{Social Capital}, \text{Institutions})$$

### Framing Effects

Presentation affects behavior:
- "Community Game" vs. "Wall Street Game"
- Emphasizing group benefits vs. individual costs
- Loss framing vs. gain framing

## Technology and Modern Collective Action

### Digital Platforms

Online collective action with:
- Reduced coordination costs
- Increased group size possibilities
- New free-riding opportunities (lurking)

### Blockchain and Smart Contracts

Automated enforcement:

$$\text{Contribution} \to \text{Smart Contract} \to \text{Automatic Penalties/Rewards}$$

### Social Media and Network Effects

[[Cascade effects]] in online participation:

$$P(\text{participate}_i) = f(\text{Baseline Utility}, \sum_{j \in \text{Network}_i} \text{Participation}_j)$$
