# Hill Function

The **[[Hill function]]** is a mathematical function that describes the relationship between the concentration of a [[ligand]] and the [[binding rate]] of that ligand to a [[receptor]]. It was originally proposed by Archibald Hill in 1910 to describe the [[cooperative binding]] of oxygen to [[hemoglobin]].

## Mathematical Formulation

### Basic Form

The standard form of the Hill function is given by:

$$\theta(c) = \frac{c^n}{K_d^n + c^n}$$

Where:
- $\theta(c)$ represents the [[fractional occupancy]] - the fraction of receptors bound to ligands
- $c$ is the [[ligand concentration]]
- $K_d$ is the [[dissociation constant]] - the ligand concentration at which half of the receptors are occupied
- $n$ is the [[Hill coefficient]] - a measure of [[cooperativity]]

### Alternative Parametrizations

The Hill function is sometimes expressed using $K_A$ (the [[association constant]]), which is the reciprocal of $K_d$:

$$\theta(c) = \frac{(K_A c)^n}{1 + (K_A c)^n}$$

Another common parametrization uses $c_{50}$ or $EC_{50}$ (the [[half-maximal effective concentration]]):

$$\theta(c) = \frac{c^n}{c_{50}^n + c^n}$$

## Interpretation of the Hill Coefficient

The Hill coefficient $n$ characterizes the [[cooperative behavior]] of the binding process:

- $n > 1$: [[Positive cooperativity]] - binding of one ligand increases the binding affinity for subsequent ligands
- $n = 1$: [[Non-cooperative binding]] - binding events are independent ([[Michaelis-Menten kinetics]])
- $n < 1$: [[Negative cooperativity]] - binding of one ligand decreases the binding affinity for subsequent ligands

The absolute value of $n$ provides a lower bound on the number of [[binding sites]] if positive cooperativity is present, though it does not necessarily equal the exact number of binding sites.

## Mathematical Properties

### Limiting Behavior

As $c \to 0$, $\theta(c) \to 0$  
As $c \to \infty$, $\theta(c) \to 1$

The [[inflection point]] of the curve occurs at $c = K_d$.

### Logarithmic Form

The Hill function can be transformed into a linear form by taking the logarithm:

$$\log\left(\frac{\theta}{1-\theta}\right) = n\log(c) - n\log(K_d)$$

This transformation, known as the [[Hill plot]], allows for the estimation of the Hill coefficient as the slope of the resulting line.

## Applications

The Hill function is widely used in:

- [[Biochemistry]] to describe [[enzyme kinetics]] and [[protein-ligand interactions]]
- [[Pharmacology]] to model [[dose-response relationships]]
- [[Systems biology]] for modeling [[gene regulatory networks]]
- [[Neuroscience]] to describe [[neurotransmitter receptor]] activation

## Generalizations

### Multi-ligand Hill Function

For systems with multiple ligands competing for the same binding site:

$$\theta_i(c_1, c_2, ..., c_m) = \frac{c_i^{n_i}}{K_{d,i}^{n_i} + \sum_{j=1}^{m} c_j^{n_j}}$$

### Extended Hill Function

For systems with a non-zero minimum and maximum response:

$$R(c) = R_{min} + \frac{(R_{max} - R_{min})c^n}{K_d^n + c^n}$$

Where $R_{min}$ and $R_{max}$ are the minimum and maximum responses, respectively.

## Relationship to Other Models

The Hill function is related to several other mathematical models:

- It reduces to the [[Michaelis-Menten equation]] when $n = 1$
- It is a special case of the more general [[Adair equation]]
- It can be derived from [[statistical mechanics]] principles using the [[grand canonical ensemble]]
- It shares a functional form with the [[logistic function]] and can be viewed as a [[sigmoidal function]]

The [[Hill-Langmuir equation]] extends the Hill formalism to surface adsorption phenomena.
