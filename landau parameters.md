**USER**

Landau parameters


**ASSISTANT**

In the context of Fermi liquid theory, Landau parameters are dimensionless quantities that characterize the effective interactions between [[quasi-particles]] near the Fermi surface. These parameters are crucial for understanding various physical properties of Fermi liquids, such as their compressibility, magnetic susceptibility, and specific heat. They effectively describe how the presence of one quasi-particle influences another in the many-body system.

### Key Concepts

1. **Quasi-Particles**:
   In Fermi liquid theory, interacting fermions are described in terms of [[quasi-particles]], which have the same quantum numbers as the original fermions but include interaction effects.

2. **Fermi Surface**:
   The Fermi surface is the surface in momentum space that separates occupied from unoccupied quasi-particle states at zero temperature.

3. **Landau Interaction Function**:
   The Landau interaction function \( f_{\vec{k}, \vec{k}'} \) describes the effective interaction between [[quasi-particles]] with wavevectors \(\vec{k}\) and \(\vec{k}'\). This function can be expanded in terms of spherical harmonics in the case of an isotropic Fermi liquid.

### Definition of Landau Parameters

For an isotropic Fermi liquid, the Landau interaction function \( f_{\vec{k}, \vec{k}'} \) depends only on the angle between \(\vec{k}\) and \(\vec{k}'\). It can be expanded in terms of Legendre polynomials \( P_l(\cos \theta) \):
$$
f_{\vec{k}, \vec{k}'} = \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} f_l P_l(\cos \theta)
$$
where \( \theta \) is the angle between \(\vec{k}\) and \(\vec{k}'\), and \( f_l \) are the Landau parameters.

The Landau parameters can be further divided into symmetric \( f_l^s \) and antisymmetric \( f_l^a \) parts, corresponding to density and spin fluctuations, respectively:
$$
f_{\vec{k}, \vec{k}'}^s = \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} f_l^s P_l(\cos \theta)
$$
$$
f_{\vec{k}, \vec{k}'}^a = \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} f_l^a P_l(\cos \theta)
$$

### Physical Properties and Landau Parameters

1. **Compressibility**:
   The compressibility \( \kappa \) of a Fermi liquid is related to the symmetric Landau parameter \( f_0^s \):
   $$
   \kappa = \frac{1}{n^2} \frac{\partial n}{\partial \mu} = \frac{g(E_F)}{1 + f_0^s}
   $$
   where \( n \) is the particle density, \( \mu \) is the chemical potential, and \( g(E_F) \) is the density of states at the Fermi level.

2. **Magnetic Susceptibility**:
   The magnetic susceptibility \( \chi \) of a Fermi liquid is influenced by the antisymmetric Landau parameter \( f_0^a \):
   $$
   \chi = \frac{\mu_B^2 g(E_F)}{1 + f_0^a}
   $$
   where \( \mu_B \) is the Bohr magneton.

3. **Specific Heat**:
   The specific heat \( C \) at low temperatures is linear in temperature, and the coefficient is modified by the effective mass \( m^* \), which is related to the Landau parameters:
   $$
   C = \gamma T, \quad \gamma = \frac{\pi^2}{3} k_B^2 g(E_F) \left( \frac{m^*}{m} \right)
   $$
   where \( \frac{m^*}{m} = 1 + \frac{1}{3} f_1^s \).

4. **Quasi-Particle Interactions**:
   The effective interaction between [[quasi-particles]] near the Fermi surface can be described using Landau parameters. These interactions are crucial for understanding various low-temperature phenomena in Fermi liquids.

### Calculation of Landau Parameters

Calculating Landau parameters from first principles involves solving the many-body problem, which is often complex. However, they can also be extracted from experimental measurements of physical properties such as compressibility, magnetic susceptibility, and specific heat.

### Example: Liquid Helium-3 (\(^3\)He)

Liquid Helium-3 (\(^3\)He) is a well-studied Fermi liquid where Landau parameters have been experimentally determined. The following are some typical values of Landau parameters for \(^3\)He at low temperatures:

- \( f_0^s \approx 10 \)
- \( f_1^s \approx -0.5 \)
- \( f_0^a \approx -0.75 \)

These parameters help explain the experimentally observed properties of \(^3\)He, such as its enhanced compressibility and specific heat compared to an ideal Fermi gas.

### Conclusion

Landau parameters are essential quantities in Fermi liquid theory, providing a means to describe the effective interactions between [[quasi-particles]]. They play a crucial role in determining the physical properties of Fermi liquids, such as compressibility, magnetic susceptibility, and specific heat. By understanding and calculating these parameters, physicists can gain deeper insights into the behavior of interacting fermion systems at low temperatures.
