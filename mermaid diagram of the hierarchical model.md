mermaid diagram of the hierarchical model


**ASSISTANT**

Sure! Here is a mermaid diagram representing the hierarchical model of behavior parameterization:

```mermaid
graph TD
    D(Drive, D)
    H(Habit Strength, H)
    K(Incentive Motivation, K)
    C(Cognitive Factors, C)
    Em(Emotional States, E_m)
    S(Situational Context, S)
    E(Excitatory Potential, E)
    
    B(Beliefs, B)
    P(Perceptions, P)
    DM(Decision-Making, DM)
    A(Affective States, A)
    M(Mood, M)
    Ev(Environmental Variables, E_v)
    Si(Situational Influences, S_i)
    
    B --> C
    P --> C
    DM --> C
    A --> Em
    M --> Em
    Ev --> S
    Si --> S
    
    D --> E
    H --> E
    K --> E
    C --> E
    Em --> E
    S --> E
```

This mermaid diagram visualizes the hierarchical structure of the [[behavioral equation]], showing how different factors influence the excitatory potential. Each component's influence on \( E \) is clearly depicted, as well as the sub-components contributing to cognitive factors, emotional states, and situational context.
