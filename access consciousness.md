Access Consciousness


**ASSISTANT**

**Access consciousness** refers to aspects of consciousness that are available for use in reasoning, guiding speech and actions, and generally controlling behavior. This concept was prominently discussed by philosopher [[Ned Block]], who distinguished it from **phenomenal consciousness**, which involves the qualitative, subjective experience of mental states.

### Core Characteristics of Access Consciousness

1. **Availability for Cognitive Functions**: Information in access consciousness is available for cognitive processing, such as decision-making, verbal report, and intentional actions.
2. **Reportability**: Access conscious states are those that can be reported and described by the subject. For example, you can verbally describe what you are thinking or feeling.
3. **Control of Behavior**: These states directly influence and control behavior and can be used to guide actions in a deliberate manner.
4. **Integration and Broadcasting**: Information in access consciousness is integrated and broadcast to various cognitive systems, making it globally accessible within the mind.

### Theoretical Issues

1. **Distinction from Phenomenal Consciousness**: [[Ned Block]]'s distinction emphasizes that one can have a phenomenal experience (what it feels like) without that experience being access conscious (available for report and control). For example, one might experience a fleeting feeling of anxiety without being able to articulate or act upon it immediately.
2. **Relationship to Working Memory**: Access consciousness is closely related to the concept of working memory, where information is temporarily held and manipulated.
3. **Neural Correlates**: Identifying the neural substrates that support access consciousness and how they differ from those supporting phenomenal consciousness.

### Philosophical Perspectives

1. **Functionalism**: This perspective aligns well with access consciousness, as it defines mental states by their functional roles. Access consciousness can be understood as the functionality of certain mental processes being available for use.
2. **Higher-Order Theories**: These theories suggest that a mental state becomes conscious when it is the object of a higher-order representation (a thought about a thought). Access consciousness could involve such higher-order representations making information available for cognitive use.

### Empirical Approaches

1. **Global Workspace Theory (GWT)**: Proposed by [[Bernard Baars]] and further developed by [[Stanislas Dehaene]], this theory posits that access consciousness involves information being broadcast to a global workspace where it is accessible to various cognitive processes.
2. **Attention Schema Theory (AST)**: Proposed by [[Michael Graziano]], this theory suggests that access consciousness arises from the brain's model of its own attention processes, allowing it to access and manipulate information.

### Formalization in Ontological Terms

#### Categories and Relations

- **Entities**:
  - **Access Consciousness (AC)**: The overarching category of states involving information that is cognitively accessible.
  - **Reportable States (RS)**: Subset of access consciousness involving states that can be verbally reported.
  - **Action-Guiding States (AGS)**: Subset of access consciousness involving states that can guide intentional actions.

- **Relations**:
  - **Cognitive Accessibility**: The relation of information being available for cognitive processes.
  - **Integration**: The process by which information is combined and made globally available.
  - **Broadcasting**: The dissemination of information across different cognitive systems.

#### Mathematical Formalization

Let $AC$ denote the set of all access conscious states. We define subsets $RS \subset AC$ representing reportable states and $AGS \subset AC$ representing action-guiding states.

Consider a mapping $W: AC \rightarrow WM$ where $WM$ is the set of working memory states. This mapping represents the integration of access conscious information into working memory.

We aim to find a function $g: WM \rightarrow A$ such that:
$$ g(w) = a \text{ for } w \in WM \text{ and } a \in A $$
where $g$ explains how a working memory state $w$ enables access conscious actions $a$.

### Practical Implications

1. **Neuroscience**: Understanding access consciousness can help in treating disorders where cognitive accessibility is impaired, such as in certain types of brain injuries or neurodegenerative diseases.
2. **Artificial Intelligence**: Designing AI systems with access consciousness-like features to enhance their ability to reason, report, and control actions in a human-like manner.
3. **Cognitive Psychology**: Improving methods for enhancing cognitive functions such as attention, working memory, and executive control.

### Conclusion

Access consciousness is a vital concept in understanding how certain mental states become available for cognitive processing, report, and behavior control. By distinguishing it from phenomenal consciousness, we can better explore its underlying mechanisms and implications in various fields, such as [[neuroscience]], [[cognitive psychology]], and [[artificial intelligence]]. This distinction helps us address fundamental questions about the nature of consciousness and its functional role in human cognition.
