Concept of Operations


**ASSISTANT**

The **Concept of Operations (CONOPS)** is a detailed description of how a military operation is to be conducted to achieve specific mission objectives. It outlines the commander’s vision for the execution of a plan, providing a clear and concise explanation of how various components of the operation will work together to achieve the desired end state. CONOPS is a critical element in military planning as it bridges the gap between strategy and tactical execution, ensuring that all elements of the force understand their roles and how they contribute to the overall mission.

## Key Components of a Concept of Operations (CONOPS)

A well-developed CONOPS includes several key elements that provide comprehensive guidance for the execution of military operations:

1. **Mission Statement**: A clear and concise statement of the mission objective, including the "who, what, where, when, and why." The mission statement sets the context for the operation and establishes the primary goals that the CONOPS aims to achieve.

2. **Commander’s Intent**: The commander’s intent describes the desired end state of the operation and the purpose of the mission. It provides overarching guidance on what must be accomplished and the conditions that define mission success. The commander’s intent helps subordinates understand the broader goals, enabling them to make decisions aligned with the overall mission even in the absence of direct orders.

3. **Operational Objectives**: Specific, measurable goals that must be achieved to accomplish the mission. These objectives detail what needs to be done at various stages of the operation and guide the allocation of resources and forces.

4. **Scheme of Maneuver**: A description of how forces will be employed and maneuvered to accomplish the operational objectives. This section outlines the movement of troops, ships, aircraft, and other assets, specifying their roles, tasks, and sequences of actions. It includes considerations of terrain, enemy dispositions, timing, and phases of the operation.

5. **Task Organization**: An outline of the organization and assignment of forces. This includes the grouping of units into task forces, their command relationships, and the designation of the main and supporting efforts. Task organization ensures that each unit understands its role within the larger operation and how it interacts with other units.

6. **Logistics and Sustainment**: A detailed plan for the logistical support of the operation, including the supply of food, water, ammunition, fuel, and medical support. This section addresses how resources will be transported, stored, and distributed, as well as the establishment of supply lines and support bases. Sustainment plans ensure that the operational forces remain combat-effective throughout the duration of the mission.

7. **Command and Control (C2)**: An outline of the command structure and communication plan, detailing how information will flow between different levels of command and units. C2 also addresses the delegation of authority, decision-making processes, and the use of communication systems to maintain situational awareness and coordination.

8. **Intelligence and Reconnaissance**: A plan for gathering, analyzing, and disseminating intelligence throughout the operation. This includes the deployment of reconnaissance assets, surveillance systems, and other intelligence-gathering methods to monitor enemy movements, assess threats, and update situational awareness.

9. **Risk Management**: Identification and assessment of potential risks to the operation, including enemy actions, environmental hazards, and logistical challenges. The CONOPS outlines mitigation strategies to reduce risks and ensure the safety and effectiveness of the forces.

10. **Rules of Engagement (ROE)**: Guidelines that define the conditions under which forces may engage in combat. The ROE ensure that actions taken during the operation are consistent with legal, ethical, and strategic considerations.

11. **Coordination and Synchronization**: A description of how different units, branches, and services will work together in a coordinated manner. This includes timing, sequencing, and integration of activities across the force to achieve unity of effort.

12. **Transition and Contingency Plans**: Plans for transitioning to follow-on operations or contingencies if the situation changes unexpectedly. These plans ensure flexibility and adaptability, allowing forces to adjust to evolving conditions on the battlefield.

## Purpose and Importance of CONOPS

The CONOPS serves several critical purposes in military planning and operations:

1. **Provides a Clear Vision**: The CONOPS communicates the commander’s vision and intent to all levels of the force, ensuring that everyone understands the mission objectives and their roles in achieving them.

2. **Aligns Strategy with Tactics**: By detailing how the operation will be conducted, the CONOPS bridges the gap between strategic objectives and tactical actions. It translates high-level strategy into executable plans that can be understood and implemented by subordinate units.

3. **Enhances Coordination and Synchronization**: The CONOPS outlines the coordination and synchronization required among different units, branches, and services, ensuring that all elements of the force work together effectively to achieve the mission objectives.

4. **Facilitates Decision-Making**: By clearly defining objectives, tasks, and roles, the CONOPS provides a framework for decision-making throughout the operation. It helps commanders at all levels make informed decisions that align with the overall mission and adapt to changing conditions.

5. **Improves Communication**: The CONOPS provides a common understanding of the operation, improving communication and reducing misunderstandings among units and command levels. This common understanding is essential for maintaining unity of effort and achieving operational success.

6. **Guides Resource Allocation**: The CONOPS details the allocation of forces, resources, and logistics, ensuring that all elements of the operation are adequately supported. This helps prevent resource shortages and ensures that critical capabilities are available when needed.

7. **Identifies and Mitigates Risks**: By assessing potential risks and outlining mitigation strategies, the CONOPS helps commanders anticipate challenges and develop contingency plans. This proactive approach reduces the likelihood of mission failure due to unforeseen events.

## Developing a Concept of Operations (CONOPS)

The process of developing a CONOPS involves several steps to ensure that the plan is comprehensive, feasible, and aligned with the mission objectives:

### 1. **Mission Analysis**

Mission analysis is the first step in developing a CONOPS. It involves understanding the higher commander's intent, the desired end state, and the specific objectives that need to be achieved. Key tasks during [[mission analysis]] include:

- Identifying the mission’s primary and secondary objectives.
- Analyzing the enemy's capabilities, intentions, and likely courses of action.
- Assessing the terrain, weather, and other environmental factors that could impact the operation.
- Identifying available forces, resources, and logistics capabilities.

### 2. **Course of Action (COA) Development and Selection**

Based on the [[mission analysis]], the planning team develops several COAs that offer different approaches to achieving the mission objectives. Each COA is evaluated for feasibility, suitability, and acceptability, and the best COA is selected for further development.

### 3. **Detailed Planning and Wargaming**

The selected COA is developed into a detailed plan that outlines the specific actions, tasks, and sequencing required to execute the operation. This plan is then tested through **wargaming**, a process where the plan is simulated against potential enemy actions and environmental conditions to identify strengths, weaknesses, and potential risks.

Wargaming helps refine the CONOPS by:

- Testing the scheme of maneuver and identifying points of friction or potential failure.
- Assessing the effectiveness of logistics and sustainment plans.
- Evaluating the command and control structure and communication plans.
- Identifying risks and developing mitigation strategies.

### 4. **Coordination and Synchronization**

The CONOPS must ensure that all elements of the operation are coordinated and synchronized. This involves:

- Establishing clear communication channels and protocols.
- Coordinating movements and actions across different units, branches, and services.
- Synchronizing timing and sequencing of key actions to achieve unity of effort.

### 5. **Risk Management and Contingency Planning**

Effective risk management is critical to the success of any operation. The CONOPS should include a thorough assessment of potential risks and outline strategies for mitigating those risks. Additionally, contingency plans should be developed to address unexpected events or changes in the situation.

### 6. **Finalization and Approval**

Once the CONOPS is fully developed and refined, it is presented to the commander for approval. The commander reviews the plan to ensure that it aligns with the overall mission objectives and provides clear guidance for execution. Once approved, the CONOPS serves as the foundation for the detailed execution planning and coordination.

## Examples of CONOPS in Military Operations

### 1. **Operation Overlord (D-Day Invasion, 1944)**

The CONOPS for Operation Overlord, the Allied invasion of Normandy during World War II, outlined a comprehensive plan for landing forces on five beaches, securing beachheads, and establishing a foothold in France. The CONOPS included:

- **Objective**: Establish a strong lodgment on the continent of Europe from which further offensive operations could be launched.
- **Scheme of Maneuver**: Amphibious landings on five beaches (Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno, and Sword) supported by airborne assaults to secure key bridges and roadways.
- **Logistics and Sustainment**: Detailed planning for the supply of fuel, ammunition, and other resources, including the establishment of artificial harbors (Mulberry Harbors) to facilitate resupply.
- **Command and Control**: A unified command structure under General Dwight D. Eisenhower, with clear communication protocols to coordinate between land, sea, and air forces.
- **Risk Management**: Planning for potential enemy counterattacks, including the use of paratroopers to disrupt German reinforcements and contingency plans for adverse weather conditions.

### 2. **Desert Storm (1991)**

The CONOPS for Operation Desert Storm, the coalition operation to liberate Kuwait from Iraqi occupation, included:

- **Objective**: Expel Iraqi forces from Kuwait and restore the sovereignty of Kuwait.
- **Scheme of Maneuver**: A phased approach with an initial air campaign to degrade Iraqi defenses, followed by a ground assault to rapidly liber
