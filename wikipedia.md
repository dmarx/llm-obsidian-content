Sure, let's dive into some details about Wikipedia.

## Wikipedia

### Overview

[[Wikipedia]] is a free, web-based, collaborative, multilingual encyclopedia project supported by the non-profit [[Wikimedia Foundation]]. Its more than 50 million articles in over 300 languages have been written collaboratively by volunteers around the world, and almost all of its articles can be edited by anyone with access to the site. Wikipedia is the largest and most popular general reference work on the Internet.

### History and Development

Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001, by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger. The name "Wikipedia" is a portmanteau of the words "wiki" (a technology for creating collaborative websites) and "encyclopedia." The project grew rapidly, and by 2006, it had become one of the largest reference websites, attracting around 60 million visitors annually by 2009. 

### Structure and Content

Wikipedia is based on a model of openly editable content. Its articles provide links to guide the user to related pages with additional information. Wikipedia is maintained by volunteer editors who apply policies and guidelines, which include verifiability and a neutral point of view. Editors can create, modify, and discuss the contents of articles. 

#### Editing and Contribution

Anyone can become a Wikipedia editor by simply registering an account, although registration is not mandatory to edit most articles. Wikipedia's editing interface is straightforward, allowing users to make both minor and substantial changes to content. The use of a "wiki markup" language enables users to format text and add images, links, and other elements.

### Reliability and Criticism

The reliability of Wikipedia has been a subject of controversy. While its open nature allows for a diverse range of contributions, it also makes it susceptible to vandalism and the introduction of false information. However, the large community of active editors and the implementation of automated bots help in mitigating these issues. Numerous studies have been conducted to evaluate Wikipedia's accuracy, and in many cases, it has been found to be comparable to traditional encyclopedias like Encyclop√¶dia Britannica.

### Usage and Impact

Wikipedia is used by millions of people daily as a source of information on a wide range of topics. Its impact extends beyond individual users; it is frequently cited in academic works, news articles, and other media. Despite concerns about its reliability, Wikipedia has become a cornerstone of modern information dissemination.

### Mathematical Formulations

In the context of mathematics and science articles, Wikipedia often includes detailed explanations and formal definitions. For instance, a page on a mathematical topic will typically contain:

- **Definitions:** Precise definitions of terms using $eqn$ math notation.
- **Theorems:** Statements of important theorems with proofs or references to proofs.
- **Examples:** Concrete examples to illustrate concepts.
- **Applications:** Real-world applications or connections to other fields.

For example, an article on the [[Fourier Transform]] might include:

$$
\hat{f}(\xi) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{-2 \pi i x \xi} \, dx
$$

where $\hat{f}(\xi)$ is the Fourier transform of $f(x)$. 

### Conclusion

Wikipedia represents a monumental collective effort to compile and disseminate knowledge. Its success relies on the collaboration and dedication of its volunteer editors, and despite the challenges associated with its open-editing model, it remains an invaluable resource for information seekers worldwide. 

For more detailed discussions on specific topics, users can refer to individual pages dedicated to those subjects, such as [[Machine Learning]], [[Quantum Mechanics]], or [[Statistical Inference]].
