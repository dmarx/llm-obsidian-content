# Enhanced Sampling

Enhanced sampling refers to a class of [[computational techniques]] designed to accelerate the exploration of [[configurational space]] in [[molecular simulations]]. These methods overcome limitations of standard [[molecular dynamics]] (MD) and [[Monte Carlo]] (MC) simulations, which often struggle to adequately sample rare events and transitions between [[metastable states]] separated by high [[free energy barriers]]. Enhanced sampling approaches are essential tools in [[computational chemistry]], [[biophysics]], [[materials science]], and related fields for investigating processes occurring on timescales inaccessible to conventional simulation methods.

## Theoretical Foundations

### The Sampling Problem

The primary challenge in molecular simulation stems from the [[ergodicity]] problem. For a system at equilibrium, the probability of observing a configuration $\mathbf{r}$ follows the [[Boltzmann distribution]]:

$$P(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{1}{Z} e^{-\beta U(\mathbf{r})}$$

Where:
- $U(\mathbf{r})$ is the [[potential energy]]
- $\beta = 1/k_B T$ is the inverse temperature
- $Z = \int e^{-\beta U(\mathbf{r})} d\mathbf{r}$ is the [[partition function]]

When [[energy barriers]] $\Delta U \gg k_B T$, transitions between states become rare events with transition times:

$$\tau_{\text{transition}} \sim \tau_0 e^{\beta \Delta U}$$

Where $\tau_0$ is a characteristic attempt frequency. This results in [[broken ergodicity]], where simulations remain trapped in local energy minima.

### Mathematical Framework

Enhanced sampling techniques can be classified based on their mathematical approach to modifying the sampling distribution:

1. **[[Temperature-based methods]]**: Modify the effective temperature to enhance barrier crossing
2. **[[Potential-based methods]]**: Alter the potential energy surface to reduce barriers
3. **[[Collective variable-based methods]]**: Focus sampling along specific [[reaction coordinates]]
4. **[[Replica-based methods]]**: Use multiple copies of the system to enhance exploration
5. **[[Path-based methods]]**: Sample transition pathways between states

## Major Categories and Methods

### Temperature-Based Methods

#### Replica Exchange Molecular Dynamics (REMD)

[[Replica Exchange Molecular Dynamics]] (or [[Parallel Tempering]]) simulates multiple replicas at different temperatures and exchanges configurations based on the [[Metropolis criterion]]:

$$P_{\text{accept}}(i \leftrightarrow j) = \min\left[1, \exp\left((\beta_i - \beta_j)(U_j - U_i)\right)\right]$$

The temperature ladder $\{T_1, T_2, \ldots, T_N\}$ is chosen to ensure sufficient exchange probability between adjacent replicas.

#### Simulated Tempering

[[Simulated Tempering]] dynamically varies the temperature of a single simulation according to a [[generalized ensemble]]:

$$P(E, T) \propto e^{-\beta E + g(\beta)}$$

Where $g(\beta)$ is a weight function that ensures uniform sampling across temperatures.

### Potential-Based Methods

#### Metadynamics

[[Metadynamics]] adds a history-dependent bias potential along selected [[collective variables]] $\mathbf{s}$:

$$V_{\text{bias}}(\mathbf{s}, t) = \sum_{t' < t} w \exp\left(-\sum_{i=1}^{d} \frac{(s_i - s_i(t'))^2}{2\sigma_i^2}\right)$$

Where:
- $w$ is the Gaussian height
- $\sigma_i$ is the Gaussian width
- $t'$ represents previous deposition times

In [[well-tempered [[metadynamics]]]], the Gaussian height decreases over time:

$$w(t) = w_0 e^{-V_{\text{bias}}(\mathbf{s}, t)/\Delta T}$$

Where $\Delta T$ is a parameter controlling the extent of free energy surface exploration.

#### Umbrella Sampling

[[Umbrella Sampling]] applies a series of biasing potentials (typically harmonic) to ensure sampling along a reaction coordinate:

$$U_i(\mathbf{r}) = U(\mathbf{r}) + \frac{1}{2}k(\xi(\mathbf{r}) - \xi_i)^2$$

The [[Weighted Histogram Analysis Method]] (WHAM) or [[Multistate Bennett Acceptance Ratio]] (MBAR) is then used to reconstruct the unbiased free energy profile.

#### Adaptive Biasing Force (ABF)

[[Adaptive Biasing Force]] methods apply a biasing force that counteracts the [[mean force]] along a reaction coordinate:

$$F_{\text{bias}}(\xi) = -\nabla_{\xi} F(\xi) = \left\langle \nabla U \cdot \frac{\partial \mathbf{r}}{\partial \xi} \right\rangle_{\xi}$$

This force is estimated on-the-fly during simulation and adaptively updated.

### Collective Variable-Based Methods

#### Accelerated Molecular Dynamics (aMD)

[[Accelerated Molecular Dynamics]] adds a boost potential to flatten the energy landscape:

$$\Delta U(\mathbf{r}) = 
\begin{cases}
0, & U(\mathbf{r}) \geq E \\
\frac{(E - U(\mathbf{r}))^2}{\alpha + (E - U(\mathbf{r}))}, & U(\mathbf{r}) < E
\end{cases}$$

Where $E$ is an energy threshold and $\alpha$ determines the smoothness of the boost.

#### Steered Molecular Dynamics (SMD)

[[Steered Molecular Dynamics]] applies an external force to drive the system along a chosen coordinate:

$$U_{\text{SMD}}(\mathbf{r}, t) = U(\mathbf{r}) + \frac{1}{2}k(\xi(\mathbf{r}) - \xi_0 - vt)^2$$

Where:
- $k$ is the spring constant
- $v$ is the pulling velocity
- $\xi_0$ is the initial value of the collective variable

The [[Jarzynski equality]] can be used to recover equilibrium free energy differences from non-equilibrium work:

$$e^{-\beta \Delta F} = \langle e^{-\beta W} \rangle$$

### Replica-Based Methods

#### Replica Exchange with Solute Tempering (REST)

[[Replica Exchange with Solute Tempering]] selectively heats parts of the system (typically a solute) while maintaining the rest at the temperature of interest:

$$U_i(\mathbf{r}) = \lambda_i U_{\text{solute}} + \sqrt{\lambda_i} U_{\text{solute-solvent}} + U_{\text{solvent}}$$

Where $\lambda_i = T_1/T_i$ is a scaling factor.

#### Hamiltonian Replica Exchange

[[Hamiltonian Replica Exchange]] uses different potential energy functions across replicas:

$$P_{\text{accept}}(i \leftrightarrow j) = \min\left[1, \exp(\beta(U_i(\mathbf{r}_j) + U_j(\mathbf{r}_i) - U_i(\mathbf{r}_i) - U_j(\mathbf{r}_j)))\right]$$

This approach is particularly useful for alchemical transformations and free energy calculations.

### Path-Based Methods

#### Transition Path Sampling (TPS)

[[Transition Path Sampling]] focuses on the ensemble of transition paths connecting stable states A and B:

$$P[x(t)] \propto e^{-\beta S[x(t)]} h_A(x(0)) h_B(x(T))$$

Where:
- $S[x(t)]$ is the action associated with the path
- $h_A$ and $h_B$ are indicator functions for states A and B

New paths are generated using [[Monte Carlo]] moves in trajectory space.

#### String Methods

[[String Methods]] identify the [[minimum free energy path]] (MFEP) connecting stable states:

$$\frac{\partial \phi(s, t)}{\partial t} = -\nabla F(\phi) + \lambda \mathbf{T}$$

Where:
- $\phi(s, t)$ is the string
- $s$ is the parameter along the string
- $\lambda \mathbf{T}$ is a Lagrange multiplier enforcing equal spacing
- $\nabla F$ is the gradient of the free energy

## Advanced Topics and Recent Developments

### Machine Learning in Enhanced Sampling

[[Machine learning]] has become increasingly important in enhanced sampling:

   $$\xi_{\text{ML}}(\mathbf{r}) = \mathcal{NN}_{\theta}(\mathbf{r})$$

2. **[[Deep generative models]]**: Creating novel configurations to seed simulations:
