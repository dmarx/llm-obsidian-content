Eötvös number


**ASSISTANT**

The **Eötvös number** (also known as the **Bond number**) is a dimensionless quantity used in fluid mechanics to describe the relative importance of gravitational forces to surface tension forces acting on a fluid interface, such as a bubble, droplet, or liquid bridge. It is particularly useful for characterizing the deformation of drops or bubbles in a fluid due to gravitational forces.

### Definition

The Eötvös number, denoted as $Eo$ or $Bo$, is given by the following formula:

$$
Eo = \frac{\Delta \rho \, g \, L^2}{\sigma}
$$

Where:
- $\Delta \rho = \rho_{\text{inner}} - \rho_{\text{outer}}$ is the density difference between the two phases (e.g., liquid and gas, or two immiscible fluids),
- $g$ is the gravitational acceleration,
- $L$ is the characteristic length scale (typically the diameter of the droplet or bubble),
- $\sigma$ is the surface tension between the two phases.

### Physical Interpretation

The Eötvös number quantifies the competition between **gravitational forces** and **surface tension forces** acting on a droplet, bubble, or interface:

- **Gravitational forces** tend to deform the shape of a bubble or droplet, elongating or flattening it.
- **Surface tension forces** resist deformation, favoring a spherical shape, as this minimizes the surface area for a given volume.

Thus, the Eötvös number represents the balance between these two effects:
- **High Eötvös number** ($Eo \gg 1$): Gravitational forces dominate over surface tension, leading to significant deformation, such as flattening or elongation of a droplet/bubble.
- **Low Eötvös number** ($Eo \ll 1$): Surface tension forces dominate, and the droplet or bubble tends to remain spherical because surface tension resists the influence of gravity.

### Special Cases and Limits

- **Small droplets or bubbles**: When the size of the droplet or bubble is small, surface tension dominates, and thus $Eo \ll 1$. This means the droplet or bubble remains almost perfectly spherical.
  
- **Large droplets or bubbles**: When the size increases, gravitational forces become more significant, leading to $Eo \gg 1$. In this case, the shape of the droplet or bubble will be noticeably deformed by gravity, often appearing oblate (flattened at the poles).

### Applications

The Eötvös number is widely used in fields like:
- **Chemical engineering**: For studying two-phase flows, including the behavior of bubbles and drops in reactors, separators, and heat exchangers.
- **Meteorology**: In the study of raindrop formation and cloud microphysics.
- **Petroleum engineering**: To analyze gas-liquid or oil-water interactions.
- **Material science**: For understanding the behavior of liquid metal droplets during casting and welding processes.

### Relation to Other Dimensionless Numbers

- **Weber number** ($We$): Both $We$ and $Eo$ measure the ratio of forces acting on the interface, but $We$ focuses on the ratio of inertial forces to surface tension, while $Eo$ compares gravitational forces to surface tension. The **Weber number** is given by:

  $$
  We = \frac{\rho U^2 L}{\sigma}
  $$

  Where $U$ is the velocity of the fluid relative to the bubble or droplet.

- **Morton number** ($Mo$): The **Morton number** describes the relative importance of viscous, gravitational, and surface tension forces, and is defined as:

  $$
  Mo = \frac{g \mu^4 \Delta \rho}{\rho^2 \sigma^3}
  $$

  The **Eötvös number** is related to the **Morton number** and **Weber number** when characterizing different flow regimes.

### Connection to Critical Conditions

- **Critical size of droplets or bubbles**: The Eötvös number can be used to determine when a droplet or bubble reaches a critical size where gravitational forces overcome surface tension, causing it to deform or break up.
  
- **Buoyancy-driven flows**: In flows where buoyancy effects are dominant, such as the rise of bubbles in liquids, the Eötvös number can help predict the rise velocity, breakup, or coalescence of bubbles.

The **Eötvös number** provides a key parameter in modeling these interactions by offering a balance between competing forces at fluid interfaces.
