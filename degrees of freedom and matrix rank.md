# Degrees of Freedom and Matrix Rank

## Formal Relationship

The concepts of [[degrees of freedom]] and [[matrix rank]] are intimately related in [[linear algebra]] and [[statistical modeling]]. Both concepts fundamentally relate to the dimensionality of spaces and the number of independent parameters or constraints in a system.

### Matrix Rank

The [[rank]] of a matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ is defined as:

$$\text{rank}(A) = \dim(\text{Im}(A)) = \dim(\text{span}(A))$$

where:
- $\text{Im}(A)$ is the [[image]] of $A$ (also called the [[column space]])
- $\text{span}(A)$ is the span of the columns of $A$

Equivalently, the rank represents:
- The number of [[linearly independent]] columns in $A$
- The number of linearly independent rows in $A$
- The dimension of the [[range space]] of $A$
- The order of the largest non-zero [[minor]] of $A$

### Degrees of Freedom

In a mathematical context, [[degrees of freedom]] (DOF) refer to the number of independent parameters that define a system's configuration or state. More specifically:

$$\text{DOF} = \text{total number of parameters} - \text{number of constraints}$$

## Connection in Linear Systems

Consider a linear system $Ax = b$ where $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$:

1. If $\text{rank}(A) = n < m$, the system is [[overdetermined]] and has:
   - 0 degrees of freedom in the solution space (unique solution if consistent)

2. If $\text{rank}(A) = m < n$, the system is [[underdetermined]] and has:
   - $(n - m)$ degrees of freedom in the solution space

3. If $\text{rank}(A) < \min(m,n)$, the system is [[rank deficient]] and has:
   - $(n - \text{rank}(A))$ degrees of freedom in the solution space

## Statistical Interpretation

In [[statistical modeling]]:

$$\text{DOF} = n - p$$

where:
- $n$ is the number of observations
- $p$ is the number of estimated parameters

For a [[linear regression]] model $y = X\beta + \epsilon$:

$$\text{DOF} = n - \text{rank}(X)$$

where:
- $X$ is the [[design matrix]]
- $\text{rank}(X)$ is typically equal to the number of columns in $X$ when $X$ has full column rank

## Geometric Interpretation

Geometrically, both concepts describe dimensional properties:

- The [[matrix rank]] corresponds to the dimension of the subspace spanned by the columns (or rows) of the matrix
- The [[degrees of freedom]] represent the dimension of the [[solution manifold]] or [[parameter space]]

For example, in a [[linear regression]] model:
- The rank of the design matrix $X$ determines the dimension of the [[model space]]
- The residual degrees of freedom $(n - \text{rank}(X))$ determine the dimension of the [[error space]]

## Null Space Connection

The relationship can also be expressed through the [[null space]] (or [[kernel]]) of a matrix:

$$\text{DOF in solution space} = \dim(\text{Null}(A)) = n - \text{rank}(A)$$

where:
- $\text{Null}(A) = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^n : Ax = 0\}$

This is a direct application of the [[rank-nullity theorem]]:

$$\dim(\text{Null}(A)) + \text{rank}(A) = n$$

## Applications

These relationships have important applications in:

1. [[Parameter estimation]]
2. [[Model selection]]
3. [[Hypothesis testing]]
4. [[Dimension reduction]] techniques such as [[Principal Component Analysis]]
5. [[Constrained optimization]]
6. [[System identification]] in control theory

## Mathematical Formalism

More formally, for a matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ representing a linear transformation $T: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$:

$$\text{rank}(A) = \dim(\text{Im}(T))$$
$$\text{DOF in solution space} = \dim(\text{Ker}(T)) = n - \text{rank}(A)$$

where:
- $\text{Im}(T)$ is the image of $T$
- $\text{Ker}(T)$ is the kernel of $T$

This provides a rigorous mathematical foundation for understanding how these concepts interrelate in the context of [[linear transformations]] and [[vector spaces]].
