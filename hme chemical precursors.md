### Conclusion

**HME lab identification** relies on recognizing the chemical precursors, equipment, and processes used to manufacture homemade explosives. The presence of chemicals like **ammonium nitrate**, **hydrogen peroxide**, **acetone**, and **nitric acid**—along with glassware, heating devices, and filtration setups—are strong indicators of an HME lab. Analytical techniques, such as **FTIR**, **GC-MS**, and **spot tests**, are essential tools for verifying the presence of explosive compounds. Given the instability and sensitivity of HMEs, extreme caution must be exercised when investigating or dismantling these labs.

HME chemical precursors


**ASSISTANT**

**Homemade explosive (HME) chemical precursors** are chemicals that can be easily obtained or synthesized and then combined to produce explosive materials. These precursors are typically non-regulated or only lightly regulated, making them accessible to individuals intending to manufacture **improvised explosive devices (IEDs)**. Knowledge of these precursors is crucial for **EOD technicians**, law enforcement, and forensics specialists in order to identify potential threats and prevent explosive incidents.

Below is a detailed list of common **HME precursors**, grouped by their type and role in explosive synthesis.
