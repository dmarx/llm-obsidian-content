theories of disruption


**ASSISTANT**

Theories of disruption explore how new technologies, business models, and market strategies can radically change the competitive landscape of industries, often displacing established firms, products, and alliances. The concept has been extensively developed in management and innovation literature, with several key theories and models explaining different aspects of how and why disruption occurs.

### Clayton Christensen’s Disruptive Innovation Theory

Clayton Christensen’s theory of disruptive innovation, introduced in his 1997 book "The Innovator’s Dilemma," is perhaps the most influential framework for understanding disruption. Christensen distinguishes between two types of technological innovations:

1. **Sustaining Innovations**: These improve the performance of established products along the dimensions that mainstream customers in major markets have historically valued. They are generally adopted by incumbent companies.

2. **Disruptive Innovations**: These innovations initially underperform on metrics mainstream customers value but offer other attributes valued by fringe or entirely new customer segments. Over time, these innovations improve and begin to address the needs of more demanding customers, eventually displacing established technologies.

Key aspects:
- **Market Entrants vs. Incumbents**: Disruptive innovators are often new entrants to a market. They exploit niches ignored by larger firms and eventually move upmarket.
- **Value Networks**: The theory posits that firms are constrained within value networks—contexts within which they identify and respond to customers’ needs, solve problems, procure input, react to competitors, and strive for profit. Disruptors can change the dynamics of these networks.

### Theories of Technological Disruption

Other theorists have expanded or contested Christensen’s views by emphasizing different aspects of technological and market change:

1. **Daneels’s Resource and Competence-Based View**: Daneels argues that disruption is not just about market forces but also about how firms fail to recognize the new competencies they need to develop in response to technological changes.

2. **Hang, Chen, and Subramian’s Theory of Response Strategy**: This theory suggests that incumbents can respond to disruption through strategies such as acquiring disruptive firms, seeking protection through litigation, or adapting the new technology to enhance their product lines.

### Blue Ocean Strategy

W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne introduced the Blue Ocean Strategy, which involves companies creating new, uncontested market spaces (blue oceans), making the competition irrelevant. Unlike disruptive innovation which may start at the low end, blue ocean strategy focuses on creating and capturing new demand and breaking away from competition.

Key aspects:
- **Value Innovation**: At the core of blue ocean strategy is value innovation, a focus that aligns innovation with utility, price, and cost positions.
- **Eliminate-Reduce-Raise-Create Grid**: This tool is used to develop new value curves for industries, showing companies how to create new value for customers and themselves.

### Network Effects and Platform-Based Disruption

The rise of digital technologies and platforms has led to new forms of disruption, often driven by network effects where the value of a product or service increases as more people use it.

1. **Digital Platform Disruption**: Companies like Amazon, Google, and Facebook have disrupted various industries by leveraging digital platforms that benefit from network effects. These platforms can scale rapidly at low marginal cost.

2. **Ecosystem-Driven Disruption**: This newer model looks at how companies create ecosystems around their products and services, integrating various functions and offerings into a seamless experience that locks in users and attracts third-party providers.

### Schumpeter’s Creative Destruction

Joseph Schumpeter described the process of "creative destruction" as a form of economic innovation wherein new products or technologies cause the obsolescence of existing ones. This view aligns with disruption but places it within broader economic cycles and innovation waves, emphasizing the destructive yet progressive nature of capitalism.

These theories collectively provide a multi-faceted view of disruption, showing it as a complex phenomenon that can be influenced by technological innovations, strategic business decisions, and broader economic forces. They highlight the importance for businesses to remain adaptive and forward-thinking to survive and thrive amid disruptions.
