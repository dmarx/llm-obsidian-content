title: support function

**USER**

Support Function


**ASSISTANT**

The support function is a fundamental component in computational geometry, especially within the context of the [[Gilbert–Johnson–Keerthi algorithm|GJK algorithm]]. It is used to find the point on a convex shape that is farthest in a given direction. This function is critical in operations involving Minkowski differences and collision detection.

## Definition

For a convex shape \( A \) and a direction vector \( \mathbf{d} \), the support function \( \text{support}(A, \mathbf{d}) \) is defined as:
$$ \text{support}(A, \mathbf{d}) = \arg\max_{a \in A} (\mathbf{d} \cdot a) $$
Here, \( \mathbf{d} \cdot a \) represents the dot product between the direction vector \( \mathbf{d} \) and a point \( a \) on the shape \( A \). The function returns the point on \( A \) that maximizes this dot product, effectively finding the point farthest in the direction \( \mathbf{d} \).

## Properties

### Convexity
The support function exploits the property of convexity:
- In a convex shape, the line segment connecting any two points within the shape lies entirely within the shape.
- This property ensures that the function will always yield a unique maximum point for a given direction.

### Geometric Interpretation
Geometrically, the support function can be visualized as "pushing" a plane perpendicular to the direction vector \( \mathbf{d} \) until it touches the farthest point of the shape \( A \). The touching point is the support point.

## Computation

### Polyhedral Shapes
For polyhedral shapes (e.g., polygons in 2D or polyhedra in 3D), the support function is straightforward:
1. **Vertices**: Evaluate the dot product \( \mathbf{d} \cdot v \) for each vertex \( v \) of the shape.
2. **Maximum**: Select the vertex that yields the maximum value of the dot product.

### Smooth Shapes
For smooth convex shapes, such as ellipsoids, the computation may involve optimization techniques or analytical solutions depending on the shape's equation.

#### Example: Circle
For a circle of radius \( r \) centered at the origin, the support function for a direction vector \( \mathbf{d} \) is:
$$ \text{support}(A, \mathbf{d}) = r \frac{\mathbf{d}}{|\mathbf{d}|} $$
This result comes from the fact that the farthest point on the circle in the direction \( \mathbf{d} \) lies along the direction vector scaled to the circle's radius.

### Computational Efficiency
The efficiency of the support function is critical in algorithms like GJK because it is invoked repeatedly. For complex shapes, pre-computation and caching strategies can improve performance.

## Example: Convex Polygon

Consider a convex polygon in 2D with vertices \( \{ \mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{v}_n \} \) and a direction vector \( \mathbf{d} \):
1. Compute the dot products \( \mathbf{d} \cdot \mathbf{v}_i \) for \( i = 1, 2, \ldots, n \).
2. Identify the vertex \( \mathbf{v}_k \) where \( k = \arg\max_{i} (\mathbf{d} \cdot \mathbf{v}_i) \).

For instance, if we have a square centered at the origin with vertices \( \{(1,1), (1,-1), (-1,-1), (-1,1)\} \) and a direction vector \( \mathbf{d} = (1, 1) \), the support function would evaluate the dot products:
- \( (1,1) \cdot (1,1) = 2 \)
- \( (1,-1) \cdot (1,1) = 0 \)
- \( (-1,-1) \cdot (1,1) = -2 \)
- \( (-1,1) \cdot (1,1) = 0 \)

The maximum dot product is 2, corresponding to the vertex (1,1). Thus, \( \text{support}(A, (1,1)) = (1,1) \).

## Applications

The support function is used extensively in:
- **Collision Detection**: Finding the farthest points in the Minkowski difference helps determine potential intersections.
- **Convex Optimization**: Support functions help in defining and solving optimization problems involving convex shapes.
- **Computer Graphics**: Efficient rendering of scenes with convex objects through quick distance and collision computations.
