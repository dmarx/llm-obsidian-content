# Physical Church-Turing Thesis

The [[Physical Church-Turing thesis]] (PCT) extends the classical [[Church-Turing thesis]] into the domain of physical reality, making a profound claim about the relationship between computation, physics, and the nature of the universe itself.

## Formal Statement

The PCT posits that any physical process - whether natural or artificially engineered - can be simulated by a [[Turing machine]] with resources that scale polynomially with the physical resources of the system being simulated. More precisely:

Let P be a physical system with finite volume V and evolving for finite time T with finite energy E. Then there exists a classical [[deterministic Turing machine]] M that can simulate P with computational resources bounded by:

R ≤ poly(V, T, E)

where R represents the time and space resources required by M, and poly() denotes a polynomial function.

## Relationship to Classical Church-Turing Thesis

While the original [[Church-Turing thesis]] addresses the equivalence of different models of computation for mathematically definable functions, the PCT makes a stronger claim about the physical world itself. The key distinctions are:

1. **Domain**: Classical CT deals with mathematical functions, PCT deals with physical processes
2. **Complexity**: Classical CT only claims equivalence in computability, PCT makes claims about polynomial-time simulation
3. **Physical Parameters**: PCT explicitly considers physical resources like energy, volume and time

## Challenges and Implications

### Quantum Computing Challenge

The development of [[quantum computing]] poses a potential challenge to the PCT. The [[quantum Church-Turing thesis]] (QCT) suggests that quantum computers may be able to efficiently solve problems that are intractable for classical computers, specifically:

Let Q be a quantum system described by an n-qubit state vector |ψ⟩ ∈ ℂ^(2^n). The simulation of Q's evolution may require classical computational resources that scale exponentially with n, violating the polynomial bound proposed by PCT.

### Philosophical Implications

The PCT has profound implications for:

1. **Physical Determinism**: If true, it suggests the universe is fundamentally computable
2. [[Computational Irreducibility]]: Some physical systems may require simulation resources approaching those of the system itself
3. [[Digital Physics]]: Supports the view that physical reality might be fundamentally discrete and computational

## Mathematical Formalization

We can formalize the PCT using the language of [[computational complexity theory]]:

Let Φ be the set of all possible physical processes, and let T be the set of all Turing machines. The PCT claims there exists a function f: Φ → T such that:

∀p ∈ Φ, ∃M = f(p) ∈ T where:
- Time_M(n) ≤ (V_p × T_p × E_p)^k for some k ∈ ℕ
- Space_M(n) ≤ (V_p × T_p × E_p)^k for some k ∈ ℕ

where:
- V_p, T_p, E_p are the volume, time, and energy of process p
- Time_M(n) and Space_M(n) are the time and space complexity of M

## Open Questions

1. Does [[quantum supremacy]] definitively violate the PCT?
2. How do [[relativistic effects]] impact the thesis?
3. What role does the [[holographic principle]] play in bounding computational resources?
4. Can [[continuous-time dynamical systems]] be perfectly simulated by discrete computation?
