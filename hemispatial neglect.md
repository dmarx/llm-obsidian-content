### Hemispatial Neglect

**Hemispatial neglect**, also known as unilateral neglect or spatial neglect, is a neuropsychological condition characterized by a failure to attend to one side of space, typically the left side. This condition often arises following damage to the right hemisphere of the brain, particularly affecting areas involved in attention and spatial processing.

#### Clinical Presentation

Patients with hemispatial neglect may:

- **Ignore objects or people on the affected side**: For instance, they might fail to eat food on one half of their plate.
- **Fail to groom or dress one side of their body**: They may neglect to shave or apply makeup on the neglected side.
- **Show unawareness of the deficit**: Known as anosognosia, where the patient is unaware of the neglect or denies its presence.

#### Neuroanatomical Correlates

Hemispatial neglect is most commonly associated with damage to the following brain regions:

- **Right Inferior Parietal Lobule (IPL)**: The IPL, particularly the supramarginal and angular gyri, plays a crucial role in spatial attention and awareness.
- **Superior Temporal Gyrus (STG)**: The STG is involved in processing sensory input and integrating it into spatial awareness.
- **Frontal Eye Fields (FEF)**: Located in the frontal cortex, the FEF coordinates eye movements and attention shifts.
- **Dorsal Attention Network (DAN)**: Includes the [[Intraparietal Sulcus]] (IPS) and FEF, critical for goal-directed attentional control.

#### Mechanisms and Theoretical Models

Several models attempt to explain the mechanisms underlying hemispatial neglect:

- **Hemispheric Asymmetry Hypothesis**: This hypothesis posits that the right hemisphere is specialized for global attention and spatial processing, while the left hemisphere is more involved in local processing and language. Damage to the right hemisphere thus disproportionately impairs spatial attention.
- **Attention Imbalance Model**: Suggests that damage to one hemisphere leads to an imbalance in the attentional networks, with the intact hemisphere exerting unopposed influence. In the case of right hemisphere damage, the left hemisphere's dominance leads to neglect of the left side of space.

#### Assessment and Diagnosis

Diagnosis of hemispatial neglect involves a variety of clinical tests and observational assessments:

- **Line Bisection Test**: Patients are asked to mark the midpoint of a horizontal line. Those with neglect typically bisect the line towards the non-neglected side.
- **Cancellation Tasks**: Patients are instructed to mark or cancel out specific targets on a sheet of paper. Neglect patients often fail to mark targets on the affected side.
- **Copying and Drawing Tasks**: Patients are asked to copy a complex figure or draw from memory. Neglect is evident when they omit details from the neglected side.

#### Neural Basis and Functional Connectivity

Functional imaging studies, such as fMRI and PET, reveal altered activity and connectivity in brain networks associated with spatial attention:

- **Right Hemisphere Dominance**: Hemispatial neglect often correlates with decreased activity in the right IPL and STG.
- **DAN and Ventral Attention Network (VAN)**: The DAN and VAN, which include the right IPL, FEF, and ventral frontal cortex, show disrupted connectivity in neglect patients. These networks are essential for maintaining spatial attention and reorienting focus.

#### Treatment and Rehabilitation

Several approaches are used to rehabilitate patients with hemispatial neglect:

- **Visual Scanning Training**: Encourages patients to systematically scan their environment towards the neglected side, enhancing awareness.
- **Prism Adaptation Therapy**: Involves wearing prism glasses that shift the visual field, temporarily correcting the neglect and promoting long-term improvements.
- **Non-invasive Brain Stimulation**: Techniques like Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) aim to modulate neural activity and restore balance between hemispheres.

### Conclusion

Hemispatial neglect is a debilitating condition resulting from damage to attention-related brain regions, predominantly in the right hemisphere. Understanding its neural basis and developing effective rehabilitation strategies remain critical areas of research.
