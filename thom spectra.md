Thom Spectra


**ASSISTANT**

**Thom spectra** are a fundamental concept in algebraic topology, originating from **Thom's work on [[cobordism theory]]**. They generalize the notion of **Thom spaces** of vector bundles and provide a powerful framework for studying cobordism classes, stable homotopy theory, and [[characteristic classes]]. Thom spectra play a crucial role in relating the classification of vector bundles to homotopy theory, enabling the use of **stable homotopy groups** to study cobordism classes.

### Key Concepts

To understand **Thom spectra**, we first need to define **Thom spaces**, and then we can generalize them to spectra.

#### Thom Space

Let \( E \to M \) be a vector bundle over a manifold \( M \). The **Thom space** of \( E \), denoted \( T(E) \), is a topological space constructed from the total space of the vector bundle by collapsing the complement of the zero section to a point.

1. **Thom Space Construction**: Given a vector bundle \( E \), the Thom space \( T(E) \) is defined as the quotient:

   $$
   T(E) = E / (E - 0),
   $$

   where \( E \) is the total space of the vector bundle, and \( E - 0 \) is the total space minus the zero section. The idea is to collapse the region outside the zero section (where the vectors are nonzero) to a single point.

2. **Geometric Interpretation**: The Thom space captures the **global twisting** of the vector bundle over the base manifold. It encodes information about the geometry of the vector bundle in a homotopy-theoretic way, making it an important tool in studying the topology of vector bundles.

For example, the Thom space of the trivial bundle over a point is just a **sphere**. More generally, the Thom space of a rank-\( n \) vector bundle over a manifold looks like a sphere bundle over the manifold, with the complement of the zero section collapsed.

#### Thom Spectrum

A **Thom spectrum** is a generalization of the Thom space construction to a sequence of vector bundles and spaces, forming a **spectrum**. Spectra are objects in **stable homotopy theory**, where one studies sequences of spaces with maps between them that become "stable" as the dimension increases.

##### Definition of a Thom Spectrum

To define a Thom spectrum, we start with a sequence of vector bundles over a sequence of classifying spaces. For a given topological group \( G \), let \( BG \) be its **classifying space**. A **Thom spectrum** is defined by associating a Thom space to each vector bundle over the classifying spaces \( BG \), \( B(G \times \mathbb{R}^1) \), \( B(G \times \mathbb{R}^2) \), etc.

Formally, let \( G \)-bundles be given by:

$$
E_n \to B(G \times \mathbb{R}^n),
$$

where \( E_n \) is the universal \( G \)-bundle over the classifying space \( B(G \times \mathbb{R}^n) \). The **Thom spectrum** \( MG \) is the spectrum formed by taking the sequence of Thom spaces:

$$
MG = \{ T(E_n) \}_{n \geq 0}.
$$

This sequence of Thom spaces \( T(E_n) \) forms a **spectrum**, where the maps between successive spaces \( T(E_n) \to T(E_{n+1}) \) are induced by stabilization maps (typically the inclusion of a vector space of dimension \( n \) into one of dimension \( n+1 \)).

##### Spectrum Structure

A **spectrum** is a sequence of spaces \( \{ X_n \} \) together with structure maps \( \Sigma X_n \to X_{n+1} \), where \( \Sigma \) denotes the suspension of the space \( X_n \) (adding an additional dimension). Spectra provide a framework for defining **stable homotopy groups**, which generalize classical homotopy groups but behave more regularly at large dimensions.

The **Thom spectrum** \( MG \) associated with a topological group \( G \) is a sequence of Thom spaces, each corresponding to a higher-dimensional bundle over \( BG \), and the spectrum captures the stable homotopy information of the associated vector bundles.

### Examples of Thom Spectra

1. **Unoriented Cobordism: \( MO \)**

   For the **orthogonal group** \( O(n) \), the associated Thom spectrum \( MO \) is the spectrum corresponding to **unoriented cobordism**. The Thom spaces \( T(E_n) \) are constructed from the universal bundles over the classifying spaces \( BO(n) \) for the orthogonal group \( O(n) \), and the spectrum \( MO \) captures the stable homotopy theory of unoriented cobordism.

   The **cobordism groups** \( \Omega_n \) for unoriented cobordism are given by the stable homotopy groups of the spectrum \( MO \):

   $$
   \Omega_n \cong \pi_n(MO).
   $$

2. **Oriented Cobordism: \( MSO \)**

   For the **special orthogonal group** \( SO(n) \), the associated Thom spectrum \( MSO \) corresponds to **oriented cobordism**. In this case, the Thom spaces are built from the universal oriented bundles over the classifying spaces \( BSO(n) \). The cobordism groups for oriented cobordism are:

   $$
   \Omega_n^{\text{SO}} \cong \pi_n(MSO),
   $$

   where \( \Omega_n^{\text{SO}} \) denotes the \( n \)-dimensional oriented cobordism group.

3. **Complex Cobordism: \( MU \)**

   For the **unitary group** \( U(n) \), the associated Thom spectrum is denoted \( MU \) and corresponds to **complex cobordism**. Complex cobordism is an important refinement of [[cobordism theory]], and the groups \( \Omega_n^{\text{U}} \) (complex cobordism groups) are given by the stable homotopy groups of \( MU \):

   $$
   \Omega_n^{\text{U}} \cong \pi_n(MU).
   $$

   The complex cobordism spectrum \( MU \) plays a crucial role in **stable homotopy theory** and algebraic topology, serving as one of the most important tools for understanding the structure of homotopy groups.

4. **Spin Cobordism: \( MSpin \)**

   For the **spin group** \( \text{Spin}(n) \), the associated Thom spectrum is \( MSpin \), and it corresponds to **spin cobordism**, which classifies manifolds with spin structures. The cobordism groups for spin manifolds are given by:

   $$
   \Omega_n^{\text{Spin}} \cong \pi_n(MSpin).
   $$

   Spin cobordism is important in geometry and physics, especially in the study of the **Dirac operator** and the **Atiyah-Singer Index Theorem**.

### Applications of Thom Spectra

1. **Cobordism Theory**: Thom spectra provide the framework for understanding **cobordism groups** in various settings, such as unoriented, oriented, spin, and complex cobordism. These cobordism groups are computed using the stable homotopy groups of the corresponding Thom spectra.

2. **Stable Homotopy Theory**: Thom spectra are central objects in **stable homotopy theory**, where they allow for the computation of **stable homotopy groups of spheres** and other spaces. The spectra like \( MO \), \( MSO \), \( MU \), and \( MSpin \) play key roles in the study of stable homotopy classes.

3. **Characteristic Classes**: Thom spectra are used to study **[[characteristic classes]]** of vector bundles, such as **Stiefel-Whitney classes**, **Pontryagin classes**, and **Chern classes**. These classes can be understood in terms of the homotopy theory of Thom spaces and Thom spectra.

4. **Algebraic Geometry and Complex Cobordism**: The spectrum \( MU \), associated with complex cobordism, has important applications in **algebraic geometry**, where it plays a role in the study of complex-oriented cohomology theories and formal group laws.

5. **Physics and Quantum Field Theory**: Thom spectra, especially in the context of cobordism, are used in **mathematical physics**, particularly in **topological quantum field theory** (TQFT). Cobordism invariants help classify possible topologies of space-time and provide insights into the structure of quantum fields.

### Summary

**Thom spectra** generalize the construction of **Thom spaces** for vector bundles and play a fundamental role in [[cobordism theory]] and stable homotopy theory. For a topological group \( G \), the Thom spectrum \( MG \) is built from the classifying space of \( G \) and encodes stable homotopy information about the vector bundles with structure group \( G \). Thom spectra are crucial for computing cobordism groups, understanding [[characteristic classes]], and exploring the deep connections between topology, geometry, and physics.
