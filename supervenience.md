Supervenience


**ASSISTANT**

**Supervenience** is a key concept in metaphysics and the philosophy of mind, particularly in the work of Jaegwon Kim. It describes a relationship between sets of properties or facts, where one set (the supervenient properties) depends on another set (the subvenient or base properties) such that there can be no change in the supervenient properties without a corresponding change in the subvenient properties. This concept is crucial for understanding how mental properties relate to physical properties.

### Types of Supervenience

#### Weak Supervenience
- **Definition**: A-properties weakly supervene on B-properties if, within the same possible world, any two entities that are identical in their B-properties are also identical in their A-properties.
- **Implication**: Weak supervenience is limited to comparisons within a single world and does not necessarily apply across different possible worlds.

#### Strong Supervenience
- **Definition**: A-properties strongly supervene on B-properties if, for any possible worlds \(W1\) and \(W2\), and for any entities \(x\) in \(W1\) and \(y\) in \(W2\), if \(x\) and \(y\) are identical in their B-properties, they must also be identical in their A-properties.
- **Implication**: Strong supervenience applies across all possible worlds, making it a more robust form of dependency than weak supervenience.

#### Global Supervenience
- **Definition**: A-properties globally supervene on B-properties if the distribution of A-properties in the world depends on the distribution of B-properties in the world as a whole. Any two possible worlds that are identical in their B-properties must also be identical in their A-properties.
- **Implication**: Global supervenience considers the holistic arrangement of properties rather than individual instances.

### Applications in Philosophy of Mind

#### Mind-Body Relationship
- **Mental vs. Physical Properties**: Supervenience is often used to describe the relationship between mental properties (A-properties) and physical properties (B-properties). The idea is that mental states depend on physical states, so any change in mental states requires a change in physical states.
- **Non-Reductive Physicalism**: Supervenience supports [[non-reductive physicalism]] by asserting that while mental properties depend on physical properties, they are not reducible to them. This allows for the independence of mental phenomena while maintaining their dependency on the physical.

### Jaegwon Kim's Contribution

#### Supervenience and Causation
- **Causal Exclusion**: Kim argues that for mental properties to be causally efficacious, they must be reducible to physical properties. Otherwise, the causal efficacy of mental properties is threatened by the causal closure of the physical domain.
- **Supervenient Causation**: Kim suggests that while mental properties supervene on physical properties, the causal efficacy lies at the physical level. This creates a challenge for [[non-reductive physicalism]], which seeks to preserve the causal role of mental states without reducing them to physical states.

#### Supervenience as a Dependence Relation
- **Dependence without Reduction**: Kim uses supervenience to explain how mental properties depend on physical properties without necessarily reducing one to the other. This allows for a layered view of reality where higher-level properties depend on lower-level properties.

### Criticisms and Challenges

#### Explaining the Dependence
- **The Explanatory Gap**: Critics argue that supervenience does not explain why or how mental properties depend on physical properties. It describes the relationship but does not provide a mechanistic explanation.

#### The Problem of Overdetermination
- **Causal Overdetermination**: If both mental and physical properties cause the same physical effects, this leads to overdetermination, which is generally considered problematic. Kim's causal exclusion argument is aimed at addressing this issue.

### Formalization of Supervenience

To formalize the concept of supervenience, consider sets of properties \(A\) (supervenient properties) and \(B\) (subvenient properties):

1. **Weak Supervenience**:
   \(A\) weakly supervenes on \(B\) if for any individuals \(x\) and \(y\) in the same possible world, if \(x\) and \(y\) are identical in their \(B\)-properties, they must be identical in their \(A\)-properties.

   \[
   \forall x \forall y (B(x) = B(y) \rightarrow A(x) = A(y))
   \]

2. **Strong Supervenience**:
   \(A\) strongly supervenes on \(B\) if for any possible worlds \(W1\) and \(W2\), and any individuals \(x\) in \(W1\) and \(y\) in \(W2\), if \(x\) and \(y\) are identical in their \(B\)-properties, they must be identical in their \(A\)-properties.

   \[
   \forall W1 \forall W2 \forall x \in W1 \forall y \in W2 (B(x) = B(y) \rightarrow A(x) = A(y))
   \]

3. **Global Supervenience**:
   \(A\) globally supervenes on \(B\) if any two possible worlds that are identical in their \(B\)-properties must also be identical in their \(A\)-properties.

   \[
   \forall W1 \forall W2 (B(W1) = B(W2) \rightarrow A(W1) = A(W2))
   \]

### Conclusion

Supervenience is a powerful concept for understanding the dependency relationship between different sets of properties, particularly in the philosophy of mind. It provides a framework for discussing how mental properties relate to physical properties, supporting [[non-reductive physicalism]] while raising important questions about causation and dependency. Jaegwon Kim's work on supervenience and [[mental causation]] has significantly shaped contemporary debates, highlighting both the utility and the challenges of using supervenience to explain the mind-body relationship.
