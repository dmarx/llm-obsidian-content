**USER**

generate plots of relevant HRSA estimates going back two decades


**ASSISTANT**

Currently, I don't have the capability to directly access databases, create real-time plots, or view historical data. However, I can guide you on how to generate these plots using public data sources and common data analysis tools.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Generating Plots of HRSA Estimates:

**Step 1: Data Collection**
- **Source HRSA Data**: Visit the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) official website or their Data Warehouse. HRSA often publishes reports and datasets related to healthcare workforce statistics, including projections and current assessments of provider shortages.
- **Historical Data**: For historical trends, you might need to look at archived versions of HRSA reports or datasets available from sources like the National Center for Health Workforce Analysis or similar. Sometimes, data repositories in academic institutions or government archives can be useful.

**Step 2: Data Preparation**
- **Data Cleaning**: Once you have the data, clean it for any inconsistencies or missing values. Make sure the data formats are consistent (e.g., all years are in the same format, the geographical data aligns, etc.).
- **Data Structuring**: Structure the data in a way that makes it easy to analyze. For example, you might want to create columns for years, provider types (psychiatrists, psychologists, etc.), and shortage estimates.
