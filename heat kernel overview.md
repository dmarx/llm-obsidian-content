### Heat Kernel Overview

The [[Heat Kernel]] represents a fundamental solution to the [[Heat Equation]], a type of partial differential equation (PDE) that describes how heat diffuses through a medium. This kernel is a central object in both the mathematical theory of heat conduction and various fields of physics and geometry. 

### Mathematical Formulation

#### Heat Equation

The [[Heat Equation]] for a function $u(x, t)$ representing the temperature at a point $x$ in a space at time $t$ is given by:

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \Delta u
$$

Here, $\Delta$ denotes the Laplacian operator, which in $n$-dimensional Euclidean space is expressed as:

$$
\Delta = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x_i^2}
$$

#### Heat Kernel

The Heat Kernel $K(x,y,t)$ is the fundamental solution to the heat equation, meaning it solves the equation with the initial condition being a Dirac delta function centered at $y$:

$$
\frac{\partial K}{\partial t} = \Delta_x K(x,y,t) \quad \text{with} \quad K(x,y,0) = \delta(x - y)
$$

where $\Delta_x$ indicates that the Laplacian is applied with respect to the $x$ variable.

### Explicit Representation in Euclidean Space

In $n$-dimensional Euclidean space, the Heat Kernel can be explicitly represented as:

$$
K(x,y,t) = \frac{1}{(4\pi t)^{n/2}} \exp\left(-\frac{|x-y|^2}{4t}\right)
$$

This expression shows that the heat kernel is a Gaussian function whose width broadens over time, demonstrating the diffusion effect.

### Properties of the Heat Kernel

1. **Symmetry**: $K(x,y,t) = K(y,x,t)$, showing that the heat kernel is symmetric in its spatial arguments.
2. **Semigroup Property**: $K(x,y,t) * K(y,z,s) = K(x,z,t+s)$, where $*$ denotes convolution over the $y$ variable. This property reflects the fact that the diffusion process governed by the heat equation is Markovian.
3. **Positivity**: $K(x,y,t) > 0$ for all $x, y$ and $t > 0$, which is intuitive given that the heat kernel represents the spreading of heat, which cannot be negative.

### Applications

The Heat Kernel has numerous applications across different fields:

- In [[Mathematical Analysis]], it is used to define solutions of the heat equation over various domains, including manifolds.
- In [[Differential Geometry]], it is used to study the properties of manifolds via the analysis of the behavior of the Laplacian.
- In [[Quantum Field Theory]], it appears in the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics and in the study of anomalies.
- In [[Graph Theory]], analogues of the heat kernel on graphs are used to define graph Laplacians and study their spectra.

Understanding the heat kernel not only provides insight into thermal phenomena but also into a broader range of diffusion processes and the geometric structure of spaces.
