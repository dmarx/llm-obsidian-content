### Perceived Value

Perceived value is a crucial concept in marketing and economics, particularly for luxury brands and marketplaces catering to the offensively wealthy. It refers to the worth that a product or service has in the mind of the consumer, shaped by various factors beyond the actual price. This perception significantly influences purchasing decisions and allows businesses to justify higher prices. Here’s an in-depth exploration of perceived value, its determinants, and strategies to enhance it.
