Koopman operator


**ASSISTANT**

The **Koopman operator** is a powerful tool in dynamical systems theory, providing a linear framework to study nonlinear dynamical systems. It is named after Bernard Koopman, who introduced this concept in the 1930s. The Koopman operator offers a way to analyze the evolution of observables (functions of the state of the system) rather than the state itself. Here's an in-depth look at the Koopman operator:

### Definition

Consider a dynamical system described by the flow map $\varphi^t: \mathbb{X} \to \mathbb{X}$, where $\mathbb{X}$ is the state space, and $t$ represents time. For an observable $g: \mathbb{X} \to \mathbb{C}$, which is a function defined on the state space, the Koopman operator $\mathcal{K}^t$ acts on $g$ as follows:

$$
\mathcal{K}^t g(x) = g(\varphi^t(x)).
$$

Here, $\mathcal{K}^t$ is a linear operator, even if $\varphi^t$ is a nonlinear map. This linearity is the key advantage of the Koopman operator approach.

### Properties

1. **Linearity**: Despite the nonlinear nature of the underlying dynamical system, the Koopman operator $\mathcal{K}^t$ is linear. For any observables $g_1$ and $g_2$, and scalars $a$ and $b$, we have:
   $$
   \mathcal{K}^t (a g_1 + b g_2) = a \mathcal{K}^t g_1 + b \mathcal{K}^t g_2.
   $$

2. **Composition**: The composition property of the flow map $\varphi^t$ translates into the Koopman operator as follows:
   $$
   \mathcal{K}^{t_1 + t_2} = \mathcal{K}^{t_1} \mathcal{K}^{t_2}.
   $$

3. **Spectral Properties**: The spectral properties of the Koopman operator can provide insight into the dynamics of the system. Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of $\mathcal{K}^t$ correspond to modes of the system's evolution. If $\phi$ is an eigenfunction of $\mathcal{K}^t$ with eigenvalue $\lambda$, then:
   $$
   \mathcal{K}^t \phi = \lambda \phi.
   $$

### Applications

1. **Data-Driven Modeling**: The Koopman operator framework is useful in extracting dynamical features from data, particularly through methods like Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), which approximates the Koopman operator from time-series data.

2. **Control Theory**: In control applications, the Koopman operator can help design controllers for nonlinear systems by leveraging the linear structure of the operator.

3. **Robustness Analysis**: The Koopman approach can be used to analyze the robustness and stability of dynamical systems by studying the spectral properties of the operator.

### Example

Consider the simple dynamical system given by the nonlinear map $x_{n+1} = f(x_n)$. The Koopman operator $\mathcal{K}$ acts on an observable $g(x)$ as:

$$
\mathcal{K} g(x) = g(f(x)).
$$

For instance, if $f(x) = x^2$ and $g(x) = \sin(x)$, then:

$$
\mathcal{K} g(x) = \sin(x^2).
$$

### Mathematical Formalization

Given a measure space $(\mathbb{X}, \mathcal{B}, \mu)$, where $\mathcal{B}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra on $\mathbb{X}$ and $\mu$ is a measure, the Koopman operator $\mathcal{K}$ can be defined on a suitable function space, such as $L^2(\mathbb{X}, \mu)$. For $g \in L^2(\mathbb{X}, \mu)$, the Koopman operator is:

$$
(\mathcal{K} g)(x) = g(\varphi(x)),
$$

where $\varphi: \mathbb{X} \to \mathbb{X}$ is the transformation defining the dynamical system.

The spectral properties of $\mathcal{K}$ can then be analyzed using tools from functional analysis, providing deep insights into the dynamics of the system.

### Conclusion

The Koopman operator provides a versatile and robust framework for analyzing nonlinear dynamical systems through linear techniques. Its ability to convert nonlinear dynamics into linear operations on observables opens up a wide range of analytical and computational methods, making it a valuable tool in various fields, including fluid dynamics, robotics, and machine learning.
