## Social Dominance Theory

### Introduction
[[Social Dominance Theory]] (SDT) is a social psychological theory that explains the hierarchical nature of human societies. Developed by [[Jim Sidanius]] and [[Felicia Pratto]] in the 1990s, SDT provides a framework for understanding how social hierarchies are formed and maintained, and how they influence intergroup relations and social behavior.

### Core Concepts

#### Group-Based Hierarchies
SDT posits that all human societies are structured as group-based hierarchies. These hierarchies are typically organized around three primary systems:
1. **Age System**: Older individuals typically have more power and influence than younger individuals.
2. **Gender System**: Males generally have more power and influence than females.
3. **Arbitrary-Set System**: Hierarchies based on socially constructed groups such as race, ethnicity, religion, or social class.

#### Social Dominance Orientation (SDO)
A key individual difference variable in SDT is Social Dominance Orientation (SDO). SDO refers to the extent to which individuals prefer and support group-based hierarchies and the dominance of high-status groups over low-status groups. It is measured using the SDO scale, with higher scores indicating a greater preference for inequality and dominance.

$$
SDO = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i}{n}
$$

where \(X_i\) are the responses to the SDO scale items and \(n\) is the number of items.

#### Legitimizing Myths
To maintain social hierarchies, societies develop and propagate legitimizing myths. These myths can be **hierarchy-enhancing** (promoting social inequality) or **hierarchy-attenuating** (promoting social equality). Examples of [[hierarchy-enhancing myths]] include ideologies such as meritocracy or social Darwinism, while examples of [[hierarchy-attenuating myths]] include human rights or social justice ideologies.

### Mechanisms of Hierarchy Maintenance

#### Institutional Discrimination
Institutions often create and enforce policies that perpetuate existing social hierarchies. For instance, educational systems, legal frameworks, and employment practices can all contribute to maintaining group-based hierarchies.

#### Behavioral Asymmetry
Behavioral asymmetry refers to the different behaviors exhibited by high-status and low-status group members that reinforce social hierarchies. High-status individuals may exhibit dominance behaviors, while low-status individuals may exhibit subordinate behaviors, thereby perpetuating the hierarchy.

#### Aggregated Individual Discrimination
Individual acts of discrimination, when aggregated across society, can significantly contribute to the maintenance of social hierarchies. These acts can be explicit or implicit, conscious or unconscious.

### Empirical Evidence

#### Cross-Cultural Studies
SDT has been supported by empirical studies across different cultures and societies. Research shows that SDO is positively correlated with support for hierarchy-enhancing policies and negatively correlated with support for hierarchy-attenuating policies. Moreover, higher SDO is associated with prejudicial attitudes and discriminatory behaviors.

#### Longitudinal Studies
Longitudinal research indicates that SDO and hierarchy-enhancing ideologies are stable over time and can predict future behaviors and attitudes related to social hierarchy and intergroup relations.

### Criticisms and Controversies

#### Determinism
Critics argue that SDT may be overly deterministic, suggesting that social hierarchies are inevitable and immutable. This perspective can overlook the potential for social change and the role of individual agency.

#### Cultural Variability
Some researchers question the universality of SDT, arguing that it may not fully account for cultural variability in the formation and maintenance of social hierarchies. Different societies may have unique mechanisms and ideologies that influence their hierarchical structures.

### Conclusion

Social Dominance Theory provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the persistence and impact of social hierarchies. By examining the interplay between individual differences (SDO), societal structures, and legitimizing myths, SDT offers valuable insights into the dynamics of intergroup relations and the perpetuation of social inequality.
