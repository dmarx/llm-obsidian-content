Things American conservatives like to criticize liberals for, which are actually situations they created or are largely responsible for


**ASSISTANT**

There are several examples where American conservatives criticize liberals for issues or policies that conservatives themselves have either contributed to or played a significant role in creating. Here are a few key examples:

### 1. **Federal Deficits and National Debt**
Conservatives often criticize liberals for increasing federal spending and the national debt. However, historically, Republican administrations have been responsible for significant increases in both. The most prominent example is the tax cuts passed under [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George W. Bush]], which were followed by large increases in the deficit. The 2017 [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act]] under [[Donald Trump]] further exacerbated the federal deficit by reducing tax revenue without commensurate spending cuts. Economists widely agree that large tax cuts without offsetting revenue sources lead to structural deficits.

#### Data Point:
- According to a Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report, the 2017 tax cuts are estimated to add approximately $1.9 trillion to the federal debt over ten years, making them a primary driver of the current debt burden.

### 2. **Decline of American Manufacturing Jobs**
Conservatives often blame liberals and Democratic trade policies, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), for the decline in American manufacturing jobs. However, this overlooks the fact that NAFTA was negotiated and signed under [[George H.W. Bush]]'s administration, and key support for globalized trade came from Republican economic orthodoxy throughout the 1990s and 2000s. Additionally, the push for deregulation and corporate tax cuts incentivized companies to offshore production to low-cost labor markets, further accelerating job losses in the manufacturing sector.

#### Key Facts:
- The shift in U.S. policy toward free-market globalism, particularly the reduction of barriers to trade and capital mobility, was part of the conservative economic agenda, reflecting [[Milton Friedman]]’s and [[Friedrich Hayek]]’s influence on Republican policy.
- Technology and automation (which is often under-discussed in these debates) have been central to job losses in manufacturing, a trend driven by market forces and corporate interests often supported by conservative deregulatory policies.

### 3. **Healthcare Costs**
Conservatives frequently criticize the [[Affordable Care Act]] (ACA) and other liberal healthcare policies for rising healthcare costs. However, U.S. healthcare costs were escalating long before the ACA, largely due to market-driven policies that favored privatization and deregulation of the healthcare industry, including pharmaceutical companies and private insurers. For example:
- [[Ronald Reagan]] was a key advocate for deregulation in healthcare, shifting many responsibilities from public to private sectors.
- Conservative administrations and policies often resisted efforts to expand public healthcare options (such as single-payer systems) that might reduce costs through government negotiation of prices, further entrenching private interests in the system.

### 4. **Opioid Crisis**
Conservatives have criticized liberals for failing to address the opioid crisis, framing it as a breakdown of law enforcement or social policies. However, the opioid epidemic has roots in deregulation and aggressive lobbying by pharmaceutical companies—industries that have historically been supported by conservative policies that favor market freedom and minimal regulation. For instance:
- [[Purdue Pharma]], the maker of OxyContin, aggressively marketed opioids under the pretense of minimal addiction risk, while oversight from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was limited due to lobbying efforts and a political climate favoring deregulation.

### 5. **Cultural and Educational Decline**
A frequent conservative talking point is that liberal policies are responsible for what they see as a decline in American values, often reflected in education or the arts. However, the erosion of public education funding has been significantly driven by conservative policies. States with strong conservative leadership have seen consistent efforts to reduce funding for public education, divert resources to private and charter schools through voucher programs, and push tax cuts that shrink available public resources.

#### Example:
- [[Betsy DeVos]]’ tenure as Secretary of Education during the Trump administration prioritized dismantling public school systems in favor of privatization, which critics argue has weakened educational equity and worsened outcomes in underfunded public schools.

### 6. **Income Inequality and Economic Inequality**
Conservatives often decry the wealth gap and blame it on liberal policies like welfare programs and progressive taxation, but many of the policies that have exacerbated income inequality were implemented by conservative or neoliberal governments. Examples include:
- **Deregulation of financial markets**: Under [[Reaganomics]] and the dismantling of the Glass-Steagall Act under a bipartisan consensus in the 1990s, financial deregulation became a hallmark of conservative economic policy. This led to the financialization of the economy, disproportionately benefiting the wealthy and contributing to greater economic inequality.
- **Union Busting**: Conservative administrations, notably under Reagan, have undermined the power of unions, which were crucial in ensuring equitable wages and working conditions for the middle class. As union power diminished, income inequality soared.

### 7. **Immigration**
Conservatives criticize liberals for what they perceive as lax immigration policies, yet many of the issues with immigration can be traced back to bipartisan or Republican-led policies. For example:
- The [[Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 1986]] under Reagan provided amnesty to millions of undocumented immigrants, with the understanding that stricter enforcement would follow—an enforcement regime that conservatives later criticized for being insufficiently implemented, despite being initiated under conservative leadership.
- Moreover, the immigration issue is closely tied to economic forces (like labor demand), where conservative policies advocating for cheap labor often conflict with stricter immigration enforcement.

### 8. **Environmental Deregulation and Climate Change**
Conservatives often claim that environmental regulation under liberal leadership stifles economic growth, but they tend to downplay or ignore the environmental degradation caused by conservative-driven deregulation. Policies that promote fossil fuel extraction, rollback of environmental protections, and refusal to acknowledge or address [[climate change]] have exacerbated the environmental crises, while some of the most significant environmental regulation (e.g., the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act) came with bipartisan or even conservative support, only later to be undone by subsequent conservative administrations.

### Conclusion
While American conservatives often criticize liberals for a range of societal and economic problems, it is important to recognize that many of these issues stem from or have been exacerbated by conservative policies. Whether through tax cuts that favor the wealthy, deregulatory efforts that contribute to crises in healthcare, finance, or the environment, or actions that undermine public goods like education and infrastructure, there are numerous instances where conservative governance has played a central role in the creation or escalation of problems that conservatives now criticize.
