# Coordination Game

A **coordination game** is a class of [[game theory]] models in which players receive higher payoffs when they choose the same or corresponding strategies. These games capture scenarios where the primary challenge is coordinating behavior rather than competing directly.

## Formal Definition

A coordination game can be defined as a normal-form game $G = (N, S, u)$ where:
- $N = \{1, 2, ..., n\}$ is the set of players
- $S = S_1 \times S_2 \times ... \times S_n$ is the strategy space, with $S_i$ representing the strategy set of player $i$
- $u = (u_1, u_2, ..., u_n)$ is the payoff function, where $u_i: S \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ maps strategy profiles to payoffs for player $i$

A game is a coordination game if there exist multiple [[Nash equilibria]] where players choose corresponding strategies, and these equilibria are Pareto-ranked (some equilibria provide higher payoffs to all players than others).

## Basic Examples

### Pure Coordination Game

The simplest coordination game involves two players who must choose between two options (A or B), and they are rewarded only if they choose the same option:

$$\begin{pmatrix} 
(1,1) & (0,0) \\
(0,0) & (1,1)
\end{pmatrix}$$

This game has two [[Nash equilibria]]: (A,A) and (B,B).

### Battle of the Sexes

A variation where players want to coordinate but have different preferences for which equilibrium is reached:

$$\begin{pmatrix} 
(3,2) & (0,0) \\
(0,0) & (2,3)
\end{pmatrix}$$

This game has two Nash equilibria: (A,A) and (B,B), but player 1 prefers (A,A) while player 2 prefers (B,B).

### Stag Hunt

A game representing the trade-off between safety and social cooperation:

$$\begin{pmatrix} 
(4,4) & (0,3) \\
(3,0) & (3,3)
\end{pmatrix}$$

This game has two Nash equilibria: the payoff-dominant (Stag,Stag) and the risk-dominant (Hare,Hare).

## Mathematical Properties

### Nash Equilibria

Coordination games have at least two pure-strategy Nash equilibria. In an $n \times n$ symmetric coordination game, there are at least $n$ pure Nash equilibria.

A strategy profile $s^* = (s_1^*, s_2^*, ..., s_n^*)$ is a Nash equilibrium if for each player $i$:

$$u_i(s_i^*, s_{-i}^*) \geq u_i(s_i, s_{-i}^*) \quad \forall s_i \in S_i$$

where $s_{-i}^*$ represents the strategies of all players except $i$.

### Pareto Efficiency

Coordination games often exhibit multiple equilibria that can be Pareto-ranked. An equilibrium $s^*$ Pareto-dominates another equilibrium $s'$ if:

$$u_i(s^*) \geq u_i(s') \quad \forall i \in N$$

with strict inequality for at least one player.

### Risk Dominance

In 2Ã—2 coordination games, an equilibrium is risk-dominant if it is the best response when a player believes the other player is equally likely to choose either strategy. For a game with payoffs:

$$\begin{pmatrix} 
(a,a) & (c,d) \\
(d,c) & (b,b)
\end{pmatrix}$$

The (A,A) equilibrium is risk-dominant if $(a-d) > (b-c)$.

## Theoretical Extensions

### Global Games

[[Global games]] extend coordination games by introducing incomplete information about the payoffs. Each player receives a noisy signal about the true payoff structure, which can eliminate the multiplicity of equilibria.

The payoff for player $i$ becomes:

$$u_i(s_i, s_{-i}, \theta)$$

where $\theta$ is a state parameter drawn from a prior distribution, and each player observes a private signal $x_i = \theta + \epsilon_i$.

### Potential Games

Many coordination games are [[potential games]], meaning there exists a potential function $\Phi: S \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that:

$$u_i(s_i', s_{-i}) - u_i(s_i, s_{-i}) = \Phi(s_i', s_{-i}) - \Phi(s_i, s_{-i})$$

This property ensures that iterative best-response dynamics converge to a Nash equilibrium.

### Evolutionary Game Theory

In [[evolutionary game theory]], coordination games model situations where strategies evolve through a process of natural selection or social learning.

The [[replicator dynamics]] for strategy $i$ in a symmetric coordination game are given by:

$$\dot{x_i} = x_i \left[ (Ax)_i - x \cdot Ax \right]$$

where $A$ is the payoff matrix and $x$ is the population state vector.

## Solution Concepts

### Focal Points

[[Focal points]] (Schelling points) are equilibria that players tend to select due to their psychological salience rather than their mathematical properties. These serve as natural coordination devices.

### Correlated Equilibrium

A [[correlated equilibrium]] allows players to coordinate their actions through a public signal. Formally, a correlated equilibrium is a distribution $p$ over strategy profiles such that:

$$\sum_{s_{-i} \in S_{-i}} p(s_i, s_{-i}) \cdot u_i(s_i, s_{-i}) \geq \sum_{s_{-i} \in S_{-i}} p(s_i, s_{-i}) \cdot u_i(s_i', s_{-i}) \quad \forall i, s_i, s_i'$$

### Equilibrium Selection

Various refinements address the equilibrium selection problem in coordination games:

1. **Payoff Dominance**: Select the equilibrium with the highest payoff for all players
2. **Risk Dominance**: Select the equilibrium that minimizes strategic risk
3. **Quantal Response Equilibrium**: Incorporate bounded rationality where players make probabilistic choices

## Applications

### Macroeconomics

Coordination games model [[multiple equilibria]] in macroeconomic contexts:
- **Bank runs**: Depositors' decisions to withdraw depend on expectations of others' behavior
- **Currency crises**: Speculators attack a currency if they believe others will do the same
- **Business cycles**: Economic downturns can result from coordinated pessimistic expectations

### Technology Adoption

The spread of technologies with [[network effects]] follows coordination game dynamics:
- **Standards**: VHS vs. Betamax, QWERTY keyboard layout
- **Platform competition**: iOS vs. Android, Windows vs. macOS
- **Social media adoption**: Facebook, Twitter, etc.

### Organizational Behavior

Within organizations, coordination problems arise in:
- **Corporate culture**: Shared norms and conventions
- **Team production**: Complementary efforts
- **Organizational change**: Transitioning between equilibria

## Experimental Evidence

Laboratory experiments have shown several consistent findings:

1. **Path Dependence**: Initial outcomes heavily influence subsequent coordination
2. **Efficiency-Security Trade-off**: Players often choose risk-dominant over payoff-dominant equilibria
3. **Group Size Effects**: Coordination becomes more difficult as the number of players increases
4. **Communication**: Pre-play communication significantly improves coordination

## Symbolic Notation System

For working with coordination games, we propose the following notation:

- $G(N, S, u)$ - A coordination game with players $N$, strategy space $S$, and payoff function $u$
- $E(G)$ - The set of Nash equilibria in game $G$
- $E_P(G)$ - The set of Pareto-efficient Nash equilibria
- $E_R(G)$ - The set of risk-dominant Nash equilibria
- $\Phi_G$ - The potential function for game $G$ (if it exists)
- $\mathcal{C}(G)$ - The set of correlated equilibria
- $\tau(G, \delta)$ - The time to convergence under dynamics $\delta$
- $V(G)$ - The value of coordination in game $G$

## Open Problems

1. **Equilibrium Selection**: Developing predictive theories of which equilibria will be selected in complex coordination games

2. **Learning Dynamics**: Understanding how different learning rules affect convergence to equilibria in coordination games

3. **Robustness**: Characterizing the stability of coordination outcomes under various perturbations

4. **Mechanism Design**: Designing institutions and mechanisms to facilitate coordination on efficient equilibria

5. **Computational Complexity**: Analyzing the computational difficulty of finding and selecting among equilibria in large coordination games
