# Tensor Programs

[[Tensor Programs]] are a theoretical framework developed to analyze wide neural networks by decomposing them into fundamental tensor operations. This approach provides rigorous tools for understanding the behavior of neural networks in the infinite-width limit.

## Mathematical Framework

### Core Operations

Tensor programs are built from three fundamental operations:

1. [[Matrix Multiplication]]:
   A ⊗ B where A ∈ ℝᵐˣⁿ, B ∈ ℝⁿˣᵏ

2. [[Coordinate-wise Operations]]:
   φ(X) where φ: ℝ → ℝ applied elementwise

3. [[Linear Combinations]]:
   αA + βB where A, B are tensors of same shape

### Master Theorem

The [[Tensor Program Master Theorem]] states that for a tensor program P with width n → ∞:

1. The output tensors converge in distribution to [[Gaussian processes]]
2. The correlations between these Gaussians can be computed recursively

Formally, for tensors X₁,...,Xₖ produced by P:
(X₁,...,Xₖ) →ᵈ GP(μ, Σ)

where:
- μ is the mean function
- Σ is the covariance kernel
- →ᵈ denotes convergence in distribution

## Tensor Program Categories

### Type I
Programs where each matrix multiplication involves at least one random matrix.

Example:
```
W ~ N(0, 1/n)
h = Wx
```

### Type II
Programs involving products of non-random matrices.

Example:
```
W₁,W₂ ~ N(0, 1/n)
h = W₁W₂x
```

### Type III
Programs with backward passes and gradients.

Example:
```
W ~ N(0, 1/n)
h = Wx
g = W^T∇L(h)
```

## Applications

### Neural Network Analysis

1. [[Forward Pass Computation]]:
   ```
   h^(l) = W^(l)h^(l-1)
   x^(l) = φ(h^(l))
   ```

2. [[Backward Pass Computation]]:
   ```
   δ^(l) = (W^(l+1))^T δ^(l+1) ⊙ φ'(h^(l))
   ```

### Limiting Behavior

For wide networks:

1. [[Neural Network Gaussian Process]] (NNGP) kernel:
   K^(l+1)(x,x') = E[φ(h^(l)(x))φ(h^(l)(x'))]

2. [[Neural Tangent Kernel]] (NTK):
   Θ^(l+1)(x,x') = K^(l+1)(x,x') + Θ^(l)(x,x')φ'(h^(l)(x))φ'(h^(l)(x'))

## Key Results

### Universality

The [[Universality Principle]] states that the limiting distribution of tensor programs is independent of the specific distribution of initialization, given matching moments.

### Equivalence

[[Network Equivalence]] shows that different architectures can lead to identical limiting kernels under appropriate scaling.

### Training Dynamics

In the infinite-width limit:
1. Weights move infinitesimally during training
2. Network function evolves as linear model in feature space
3. Training converges to global minimum

## Extended Applications

### Architecture Design

1. [[Width-Depth Tradeoffs]]:
   Analysis of how width and depth affect network expressivity

2. [[Initialization Schemes]]:
   Derivation of optimal initialization distributions

### Optimization Analysis

1. [[Gradient Flow]]:
   Characterization of continuous-time training dynamics

2. [[Learning Rate Scaling]]:
   Determination of appropriate learning rates for different widths

- [[Mean Field Theory]]
- [[Gaussian Process Regression]]
- [[Infinite-Width Networks]]

## Open Problems

1. [[Finite-Width Corrections]]:
   Understanding deviations from infinite-width predictions

2. [[Architecture Dependencies]]:
   Analyzing how architectural choices affect limiting behavior

3. [[Training Dynamics]]:
   Characterizing evolution of finite-width networks during training

Tensor Programs provide a powerful mathematical framework for analyzing neural networks, offering both theoretical insights and practical guidance for architecture design and optimization.
