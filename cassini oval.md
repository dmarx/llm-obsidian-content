**ASSISTANT**

A Cassini oval, also known as a Cassini ellipse or Cassini curve, is a type of quartic plane curve defined as the locus of points for which the product of the distances to two fixed points (foci) is constant. This is in contrast to an ellipse, where the sum of the distances to the foci is constant.

### Mathematical Definition

Let \( F_1 \) and \( F_2 \) be two fixed points (the foci), and let \( a \) be the constant product of the distances. If \( P \) is a point on the Cassini oval, then the defining property is:

$$
|PF_1| \cdot |PF_2| = a^2
$$

In Cartesian coordinates, if the foci \( F_1 \) and \( F_2 \) are located at \( (-c, 0) \) and \( (c, 0) \) respectively, the equation of the Cassini oval is:

$$
\left( (x + c)^2 + y^2 \right) \left( (x - c)^2 + y^2 \right) = a^4
$$

### Special Cases and Shapes

The shape of a Cassini oval depends on the relationship between \( a \) and \( c \):

- **When \( a = c \)**, the curve is a lemniscate of Bernoulli, which resembles a figure-eight.
- **When \( a > c \)**, the curve is a single, closed, ovoid shape.
- **When \( a < c \)**, the curve consists of two disjoint loops.

### Example: Lemniscate of Bernoulli

For the special case \( a = c \), the equation simplifies to:

$$
\left( (x + c)^2 + y^2 \right) \left( (x - c)^2 + y^2 \right) = c^4
$$

By setting \( c = 1 \) for simplicity, the equation becomes:

$$
\left( (x + 1)^2 + y^2 \right) \left( (x - 1)^2 + y^2 \right) = 1
$$

### Properties

- **Symmetry**: Cassini ovals are symmetric with respect to both the x-axis and y-axis.
- **Self-intersection**: When \( a = c \), the curve intersects itself at the origin.
- **Area**: The area enclosed by a Cassini oval can be computed, but it requires [[elliptic integrals]] for general cases. For the lemniscate of Bernoulli, the area can be calculated more straightforwardly.

### Relation to Ellipses and Hyperbolas

- **Ellipses**: Defined by the sum of distances to two foci being constant.
- **Hyperbolas**: Defined by the difference of distances to two foci being constant.
- **Cassini Ovals**: Defined by the product of distances to two foci being constant.

### Applications

Cassini ovals appear in various fields such as optics, dynamical systems, and complex analysis. They are particularly interesting in the study of caustics and in the design of certain optical systems where the path of light rays can be described by these curves.

### Visual Representation

For visualizing Cassini ovals, plotting the equation for different values of \( a \) and \( c \) can show the transition from two separate loops to a single loop and finally to a figure-eight shape as \( a \) varies relative to \( c \).
