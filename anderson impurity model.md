Anderson impurity model


**ASSISTANT**

The Anderson impurity model (AIM) is a fundamental theoretical framework used to study localized magnetic impurities in metals. It was introduced by Philip W. Anderson in 1961 to describe the behavior of a localized electronic state (impurity) interacting with the conduction electrons of a host metal. The AIM is particularly important in understanding phenomena such as the Kondo effect, where the magnetic impurity leads to strong correlations and low-temperature anomalies in the system's properties.

## Overview

### Model Hamiltonian

The Hamiltonian of the Anderson impurity model is given by:

$$
H = H_{\text{imp}} + H_{\text{host}} + H_{\text{hyb}}
$$

where:
- \( H_{\text{imp}} \) describes the impurity,
- \( H_{\text{host}} \) describes the host conduction electrons,
- \( H_{\text{hyb}} \) describes the hybridization between the impurity and the host.

#### Impurity Term

The impurity term \( H_{\text{imp}} \) is given by:

$$
H_{\text{imp}} = \sum_{\sigma} \epsilon_d d_{\sigma}^\dagger d_{\sigma} + U n_{d\uparrow} n_{d\downarrow}
$$

where:
- \( d_{\sigma}^\dagger \) and \( d_{\sigma} \) are the creation and annihilation operators for the impurity state with spin \(\sigma\),
- \( \epsilon_d \) is the energy level of the impurity,
- \( U \) is the on-site Coulomb repulsion between electrons in the impurity,
- \( n_{d\sigma} = d_{\sigma}^\dagger d_{\sigma} \) is the number operator for the impurity state.

#### Host Term

The host term \( H_{\text{host}} \) describes the conduction electrons of the host metal:

$$
H_{\text{host}} = \sum_{k, \sigma} \epsilon_k c_{k\sigma}^\dagger c_{k\sigma}
$$

where \( c_{k\sigma}^\dagger \) and \( c_{k\sigma} \) are the creation and annihilation operators for conduction electrons with momentum \( k \) and spin \(\sigma\), and \( \epsilon_k \) are their energy levels.

#### Hybridization Term

The hybridization term \( H_{\text{hyb}} \) describes the interaction between the impurity and the host conduction electrons:

$$
H_{\text{hyb}} = \sum_{k, \sigma} \left( V_k c_{k\sigma}^\dagger d_{\sigma} + V_k^* d_{\sigma}^\dagger c_{k\sigma} \right)
$$

where \( V_k \) is the hybridization matrix element between the impurity and the conduction band states.

### Physical Interpretation

The Anderson impurity model captures the essential physics of a magnetic impurity in a metal:
- **Localized State**: The impurity level \(\epsilon_d\) can be occupied by up to two electrons (one of each spin), with an on-site Coulomb repulsion \(U\).
- **Hybridization**: The impurity can exchange electrons with the conduction band via hybridization, leading to complex many-body interactions.
- **Charge and Spin Fluctuations**: The impurity's occupation and spin state fluctuate due to interactions with the conduction electrons.

## Key Phenomena

### Kondo Effect

The Kondo effect is a prominent phenomenon described by the Anderson impurity model. At low temperatures, the conduction electrons screen the localized magnetic moment of the impurity, leading to the formation of a many-body singlet state. This results in:
- **Kondo Singlet**: A strongly correlated state where the impurity spin is screened by the conduction electrons.
- **Resistance Minimum**: A characteristic minimum in the electrical resistance as a function of temperature, followed by a logarithmic increase at lower temperatures.

### Local Moment Formation

When the impurity level \(\epsilon_d\) is well below the Fermi level and the Coulomb repulsion \(U\) is large, the impurity tends to form a localized magnetic moment. This occurs because the impurity level is singly occupied, and the large \(U\) prevents double occupancy.

### Mixed Valence Regime

In the mixed valence regime, the impurity level is close to the Fermi level, and charge fluctuations become significant. The impurity can fluctuate between different charge states, leading to a complex interplay between charge and spin dynamics.

## Methods of Solution

### Numerical Renormalization Group (NRG)

The NRG is a powerful method for solving the Anderson impurity model, particularly in the low-temperature regime. It involves discretizing the conduction band and iteratively diagonalizing the Hamiltonian to capture the many-body ground state and low-energy excitations.

### Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC)

QMC methods provide a stochastic approach to solving the Anderson impurity model. They are particularly useful for finite temperature calculations and allow for the computation of dynamic quantities such as spectral functions.

### Exact Diagonalization (ED)

ED methods involve directly diagonalizing the Hamiltonian matrix, which is feasible for small systems. ED is useful for gaining insights into the impurity model, particularly in the high-energy regime.

### Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT)

DMFT maps a lattice problem to an effective Anderson impurity model, solving it self-consistently to capture strong correlation effects in materials. DMFT combined with the Anderson impurity model provides a powerful framework for studying correlated electron systems.

## Applications

The Anderson impurity model has wide-ranging applications in understanding:
- **Magnetic Impurities in Metals**: Describing the behavior of localized magnetic moments in metallic hosts.
- **Quantum Dots**: Modeling the electronic properties of quantum dots, where discrete energy levels interact with conduction leads.
- **Heavy Fermion Systems**: Explaining the properties of materials with localized f-electron states hybridizing with conduction electrons.
- **Strongly Correlated Electron Systems**: Providing insights into the behavior of correlated materials within the DMFT framework.
