**USER**

> Taboo as Information Boundary

huh?


**ASSISTANT**

The user is questioning the specific claim about "Taboo as Information Boundary" - they seem confused by this characterization. Let me think about this more carefully.

I made a claim that "Taboos function as information barriers that compartmentalize cultural knowledge. Crossing these barriers provides information gain." But this might not be the most accurate or clear way to think about taboos.

Taboos aren't necessarily about information barriers in the technical sense. They're more about behavioral restrictions, moral boundaries, and social norms. While violating a taboo might provide some kind of experiential knowledge or social information, framing taboos primarily as "information boundaries" is probably misleading or at least not the most useful way to think about them.

The user's "huh?" suggests they find this framing confusing or incorrect. I should acknowledge this and provide a clearer, more accurate characterization of what taboos actually are and how they relate to information, if at all.

Since this is supposed to be wiki content and I'm not supposed to respond conversationally, I should revise that section to be more accurate and clear.# Risk Excitement and Taboo Violation (Revised Section)

## Taboo as Behavioral Constraint System

Taboos represent [[normative boundaries]] that prohibit specific behaviors, thoughts, or associations rather than functioning primarily as information barriers. The excitement derived from taboo violation emerges from the [[transgression of behavioral constraints]] rather than the acquisition of hidden knowledge.

### Constraint-Based Model

Taboos operate as [[behavioral constraint functions]] that restrict the action space:

```
A_permitted = A_total - A_taboo
```

Where:
- A_total: complete behavioral repertoire
- A_taboo: behaviors marked as forbidden
- A_permitted: socially acceptable action space

The excitement derives from temporarily expanding the action space through constraint violation:

```
E_transgression = f(||A_expanded|| - ||A_permitted||)
```

### Social Penalty Functions

Rather than information barriers, taboos implement [[social penalty functions]] that map behaviors to consequences:

```
P(b) = {
  0           if b ∈ A_permitted
  penalty(b)  if b ∈ A_taboo
}
```

Where penalty(b) represents the expected social, moral, or psychological cost of behavior b.

### Constraint Relief Dynamics

The psychological appeal of taboo violation can be modeled through [[constraint relief]] rather than information gain:

```
Relief(t) = ∫_0^t Constraint_pressure(τ) dτ × Violation_intensity(t)
```

This captures how accumulated constraint pressure is released through transgressive acts.

The excitement emerges from the temporary suspension of [[normative monitoring]] rather than from accessing forbidden knowledge domains.
