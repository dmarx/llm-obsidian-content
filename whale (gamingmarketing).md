# Whale (Gaming/Marketing)

In [[gaming industry]] and [[digital marketing]] contexts, a "[[whale]]" refers to a high-value user who generates disproportionate revenue through substantial spending on [[microtransactions]], [[in-app purchases]], or [[premium content]].

## Mathematical Formalization

Let's define a formal model for identifying and analyzing whales in a user population:

Let U be the set of all users, and T(u) be the total spending of user u ∈ U over some time period t.

Define the whale threshold function W(U,α) where α ∈ (0,1):
```
W(U,α) = Q(T(U), 1-α)
```
where Q(T(U),p) is the p-th quantile of the spending distribution.

A user u is classified as a whale if:
```
T(u) ≥ W(U,α)
```

## Key Metrics

### Whale Ratio (ρ)
The proportion of total revenue generated by whales:
```
ρ = ∑(T(u) for u ∈ W) / ∑(T(u) for u ∈ U)
```
where W ⊆ U is the set of whale users.

### Whale Concentration (κ)
The ratio of average whale spending to average non-whale spending:
```
κ = (∑(T(w) for w ∈ W)/|W|) / (∑(T(u) for u ∈ U\W)/|U\W|)
```

## Business Implications

The presence of whales often leads to:
- [[Power law distribution]] in revenue generation
- [[Pareto principle]] manifestation (commonly 80% of revenue from 20% of users)
- Need for specialized [[customer retention]] strategies
- Ethical considerations regarding [[exploitative monetization]]
- Impact on [[game balance]] and [[player economy]]
