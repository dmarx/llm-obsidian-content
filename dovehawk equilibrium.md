**USER**

dove/hawk equilibrium


**ASSISTANT**

The "dove-hawk equilibrium" is a concept from evolutionary game theory, specifically within the context of the **Hawk-Dove game** (also known as the **Hawk-Dove-Bourgeois game**). It models conflict and aggression strategies in a population where individuals adopt different strategies to compete for resources. The two main strategies are:

- **Hawk:** Always fight for the resource aggressively.
- **Dove:** Avoid fighting and either retreat or share if confronted.

The equilibrium arises when the population reaches a stable point where both strategies coexist in a way that no individual has a strong incentive to change their strategy, typically forming a **mixed Nash equilibrium** or an **Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS)**.

### Game Setup

Let’s consider the payoff structure of the Hawk-Dove game. When two individuals contest a resource of value $V$, the payoffs depend on the strategies they adopt:

1. **Hawk vs. Hawk:** Both fight, leading to a costly conflict. The payoff for each is
   $$ \frac{V - C}{2}, $$
   where $C$ is the cost of the fight. In simple terms, they split the resource, but both incur the cost of the conflict. 

2. **Hawk vs. Dove:** The Hawk always wins, and the Dove retreats. The payoffs are
   - **Hawk:** $V$
   - **Dove:** $0$

3. **Dove vs. Dove:** Both avoid conflict and share the resource, so the payoff is
   $$ \frac{V}{2} $$ for each.

### Payoff Matrix

The corresponding **payoff matrix** is:

\[
\begin{array}{c|c c}
& \text{Hawk} & \text{Dove} \\
\hline
\text{Hawk} & \frac{V - C}{2}, \frac{V - C}{2} & V, 0 \\
\text{Dove} & 0, V & \frac{V}{2}, \frac{V}{2}
\end{array}
\]

### Mixed Nash Equilibrium

In evolutionary game theory, we often seek the proportion of Hawks and Doves that will exist in the population when no individual can increase their expected payoff by changing strategies. To find the equilibrium, consider the expected payoffs for each strategy. Let $p$ represent the proportion of Hawks in the population, and $1-p$ the proportion of Doves.

- The expected payoff for a Hawk ($\Pi_H$) is:
  \[
  \Pi_H = p \cdot \frac{V - C}{2} + (1 - p) \cdot V
  \]

- The expected payoff for a Dove ($\Pi_D$) is:
  \[
  \Pi_D = p \cdot 0 + (1 - p) \cdot \frac{V}{2}
  \]

In equilibrium, the payoffs of the two strategies must be equal, so we set $\Pi_H = \Pi_D$:

\[
p \cdot \frac{V - C}{2} + (1 - p) \cdot V = (1 - p) \cdot \frac{V}{2}
\]

Expanding this:

\[
p \cdot \frac{V - C}{2} + V - pV = \frac{V}{2} - p \cdot \frac{V}{2}
\]

Simplifying and solving for $p$:

\[
p \cdot \left(\frac{V - C}{2} - V + \frac{V}{2}\right) = 0
\]

\[
p \cdot \left(\frac{-C}{2}\right) = \frac{V}{2} - V
\]

\[
p = \frac{V}{C}
\]

Thus, the equilibrium proportion of Hawks in the population is $p = \frac{V}{C}$, and the proportion of Doves is $1 - p = 1 - \frac{V}{C}$.

### Interpretation

- When the **value of the resource ($V$)** is low compared to the **cost of conflict ($C$)**, the population will have a higher proportion of Doves, as fighting is too costly relative to the reward.
- When $V$ is close to or exceeds $C$, a greater proportion of Hawks will exist, as the resource is worth the risk of conflict.

### Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS)

The Hawk-Dove game also exhibits an **evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS)**, where a small proportion of mutants (Hawks or Doves) entering the population won’t have an advantage over the current strategy distribution. The mixed Nash equilibrium ($p = \frac{V}{C}$) can often act as an ESS under certain conditions.

If the cost of fighting is too high, the population might converge to all Doves. Conversely, if the resource is extremely valuable relative to the cost of fighting, the population could skew toward Hawks. However, the mixed strategy typically forms the stable point where both Hawks and Doves persist in the population.

The dove-hawk equilibrium provides insight into how real-world populations balance aggression and cooperation, particularly when the costs of conflict are significant relative to the rewards.
