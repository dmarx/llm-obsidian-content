### Landian Hyperstition

"Landian hyperstition" is a term that arises from the philosophical and cultural theories promoted by Nick Land, particularly during his time as part of the Cybernetic Culture Research Unit (CCRU) at Warwick University. This concept is deeply entwined with the CCRUâ€™s broader explorations into cybernetics, theory-fiction, and occult technologies.

#### Overview

"Hyperstition" is a portmanteau of "hyper" and "superstition," coined to describe a set of ideas that make themselves real through cultural or social operation. The concept is central to the philosophy of Nick Land and his collaborators, who used it to explore how fictions can become truths. Hyperstition functions as a feedback loop where ideas catalyze real-world events which then feed back into the idea, amplifying it further.

#### Mathematical and Philosophical Foundation

Hyperstition can be modeled through several theoretical frameworks:

1. **Self-fulfilling prophecy**:
   This sociological concept, where a predicted event causes human behavior that makes the event occur, is a straightforward analog. Mathematically, this can be modeled as a fixed point of a function $f$, where a belief or prediction stabilizes in a population if $f(x) = x$.

2. **Strange attractor**:
   In dynamic systems, a strange attractor provides a complex set which a trajectory never repeats but is confined within. Hyperstitions might be likened to cultural or informational strange attractors, where ideas evolve chaotically within a bounded conceptual space but profoundly influence thoughts and behaviors.

3. **Viral memetics**:
   Dawkins' concept of memes as units of cultural transmission is relevant here. Hyperstitions spread like viruses through media and social interactions, altering behavior and cultural norms. They can be analyzed using epidemic models such as the SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) model, where the transmission rate and recovery rate dictate the spread of ideas.

$$ \frac{dS}{dt} = -\beta SI, \quad \frac{dI}{dt} = \beta SI - \gamma I, \quad \frac{dR}{dt} = \gamma I $$

Here, $S$ represents the susceptible population, $I$ the infected, and $R$ the recovered. The parameters $\beta$ and $\gamma$ represent the rate of infection and recovery, respectively, reflecting how quickly a hyperstition spreads and fades.

#### Philosophical Implications

Hyperstition challenges the boundary between fiction and reality, asserting that in a postmodern context, narrative and reality are not strictly separate. This has implications for epistemology (the study of knowledge) and ontology (the study of being). In a Landian framework, reality itself is contingent and can be manipulated through the propagation of powerful ideas and narratives.

#### Conclusion

Landian hyperstition illustrates how certain speculative ideas in philosophy and cultural theory can have direct, tangible effects on real-world conditions and behaviors. It invites reconsideration of the nature of reality, truth, and the power of narrative in shaping both. Understanding this concept requires not only philosophical insight but also an appreciation for complex systems and mathematical models of behavior and cultural transmission. For more detailed explorations, topics like [[Dynamic Systems Theory]], [[Memetics]], and [[Cultural Studies]] are relevant.

For anyone studying the impacts of narrative on culture and reality, Landian hyperstition provides a compelling framework for analyzing how ideas transform and shape the world.
