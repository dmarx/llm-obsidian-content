access consciousness vs phenomenal consciousness


**ASSISTANT**

The distinction between *access consciousness* and *phenomenal consciousness* is a prominent one in the philosophy of mind, particularly in discussions on the nature of consciousness and its functions. The terms were coined by the philosopher [[Ned Block]] in his influential 1995 paper, *On a Confusion about a Function of Consciousness*. Here’s a breakdown of both concepts:

### Access Consciousness (A-consciousness)
*Access consciousness* refers to the aspects of mental states that are directly available for reasoning, action, and verbal report. In other words, a mental state is access-conscious if the information it carries can be accessed, processed, and used by other cognitive systems to guide behavior or decision-making.

Formally, a mental state is said to be *A-conscious* if the subject can:
- Report on its contents (i.e., describe or discuss the state).
- Use its information for reasoning or higher cognitive functions.
- Control actions based on the information within that state.

The key point is that *access consciousness* is tied to cognitive and functional access: it is about how mental content can be integrated into our overall cognitive architecture.

For instance:
- When you perceive the color red, and this perception allows you to report “I see something red,” reason about its implications (e.g., a traffic light), or adjust your behavior accordingly (e.g., stopping at the light), you are engaging in access-consciousness.

Mathematically, you can model this as a function where the sensory input \( I \) leads to a mental state \( M \), and *A-consciousness* involves a set of cognitive processes \( C \), such that:
$$
M \xrightarrow{A} C(M)
$$
where \( C(M) \) represents the cognitive uses of \( M \), such as reporting or decision-making.

### Phenomenal Consciousness (P-consciousness)
*Phenomenal consciousness* refers to the subjective, qualitative aspects of experience—often described as "what it is like" to have a particular mental state. This type of consciousness captures the *qualia* of experience: the raw, subjective feel of mental states, such as the redness of red, the taste of coffee, or the sensation of pain.

P-consciousness is often defined as a non-functional aspect of consciousness—it describes the intrinsic nature of experience without necessarily tying it to any cognitive accessibility or behavior. The qualitative experience of seeing red, for example, is something that is "for you" and might exist even if you didn’t report or reason about it.

This distinction is critical because a person might have P-conscious states that aren't immediately accessible to other cognitive processes. For instance, subliminal perceptions—those below the threshold of conscious awareness—may still be *phenomenally* conscious without being *access* conscious, in cases where you have a feeling but cannot report or rationally act on it.

Philosophically, *phenomenal consciousness* is associated with the "hard problem" of consciousness, as identified by [[David Chalmers]], because it pertains to explaining how and why physical processes in the brain give rise to subjective experiences.

### Differences Between A-consciousness and P-consciousness
1. **Functional vs. Experiential**: A-consciousness is primarily functional—about how mental content can be accessed and used—whereas P-consciousness is experiential, concerning the raw feel of experiences.
   
2. **Reportability**: Access consciousness entails reportability (or at least cognitive access). Phenomenal consciousness can exist without reportability or access (e.g., you can have a qualitative experience without being able to articulate it or reason with it).

3. **Cognitive Access**: A-conscious states are cognitively accessible, while P-conscious states are not necessarily accessible in the same way, and could, in principle, exist without any form of cognitive access or integration.

### Philosophical Debates
- **Epistemological**: Some argue that all conscious states must be accessible in some sense (e.g., [[Daniel Dennett]]), pushing back against Block’s sharp distinction. They suggest that phenomenal and access consciousness might be different aspects of the same underlying cognitive processes.
  
- **Metaphysical**: The existence of P-consciousness raises deep metaphysical questions about the nature of the mind. Dualists might argue that P-consciousness provides evidence that mental states cannot be reduced purely to physical processes, while physicalists are tasked with explaining how such qualitative experiences arise from the brain's computational functions.

### Empirical Considerations
In empirical consciousness research, the distinction plays a role in experimental paradigms, especially in studies involving blindsight, subliminal perception, or split-brain patients:
- **Blindsight**: Patients with blindsight have no *phenomenal* experience of vision in certain areas of their visual field but can still make accurate visual discriminations in those areas. This is seen as a case where access consciousness is present without phenomenal consciousness.
  
- **Subliminal Perception**: Information that is processed below the level of conscious awareness (thus without phenomenal consciousness) can sometimes still influence behavior, suggesting access without accompanying P-consciousness.

In conclusion, *access consciousness* is about information being available to cognitive processes for reasoning and control of behavior, while *phenomenal consciousness* is about the raw, qualitative feel of experience itself. Both are crucial in understanding the multifaceted nature of consciousness, but they highlight different aspects of how the mind functions and what it is like to have a conscious experience.
