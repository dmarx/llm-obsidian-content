### Resilience of Cooperative Behaviors to Non-Cooperative Strategies

Certain cooperative behaviors can be resilient to invasion by non-cooperative strategies due to their evolutionary stability. Here, we explore how specific cooperative strategies, identified by the theory of 'Morality as Cooperation' (MAC), achieve this resilience through the framework of Evolutionarily Stable Strategies (ESS).

### Mechanisms of Resilience

#### 1. **Kin Selection**
**Family Values**: Altruistic behaviors toward kin are resilient because they increase inclusive fitness. The genetic relatedness ensures that helping relatives indirectly promotes the altruist's genes.

- **Hamilton's Rule**: 
  $$
  rB > C
  $$
  This means that as long as the genetic relatedness \( r \), multiplied by the benefit \( B \) to the recipient, exceeds the cost \( C \) to the altruist, the altruistic behavior will be stable.

#### 2. **Direct Reciprocity**
**Reciprocity**: Direct reciprocity can create stable cooperation through repeated interactions where individuals remember past behaviors and reciprocate accordingly.

- **Tit-for-Tat Strategy**: This strategy starts with cooperation and then mimics the partner's previous move. It punishes defection immediately and rewards cooperation, making it costly for individuals to adopt a non-cooperative strategy.

  $$
  \begin{matrix}
  & \text{Cooperate} & \text{Defect} \\
  \text{Cooperate} & (R, R) & (S, T) \\
  \text{Defect} & (T, S) & (P, P) \\
  \end{matrix}
  $$
  where \( R \) (reward) > \( P \) (punishment), \( T \) (temptation) > \( R \), but \( R \) > \( S \) (sucker).

#### 3. **Indirect Reciprocity**
**Reputation-Based Cooperation**: Indirect reciprocity relies on reputation, where individuals help others to maintain or enhance their own reputation, which in turn makes them more likely to receive help from others.

- **Reputation Payoff**:
  $$
  \pi_i = \sum_{j} w_{ij} (b_{ij} - c_{ij})
  $$
  Reputation scores \( w_{ij} \) ensure that those who maintain a good reputation by cooperating are more likely to be favored in future interactions, deterring defection.

#### 4. **Network Reciprocity**
**Local Interactions**: Network reciprocity occurs in structured populations where individuals are more likely to interact with neighbors. Cooperation can cluster, creating pockets of cooperators who support each other.

- **Network Payoff**:
  $$
  \pi_i = \sum_{j \in \text{neighbors of } i} (b_{ij} - c_{ij})
  $$
  In this context, cooperators benefit more from mutual support within their local network than they lose from interactions with occasional defectors.

#### 5. **Group Selection**
**Group Loyalty and Heroism**: Group selection posits that groups with higher levels of cooperation can outcompete less cooperative groups, making cooperation an advantageous strategy at the group level.

- **Multilevel Selection Equation**:
  $$
  \Delta z = \Delta z_{w} + \Delta z_{b}
  $$
  The between-group component \( \Delta z_{b} \) ensures that cooperative groups have higher overall fitness, leading to the proliferation of cooperation.

#### 6. **Strong Reciprocity**
**Punishment of Defectors**: Strong reciprocity involves altruistic punishment, where individuals incur a cost to punish defectors. This discourages non-cooperative behavior by making defection costly.

- **Punishment Mechanism**:
  $$
  \pi_i = b - c - p \cdot \delta_{def} + r \cdot \delta_{coop}
  $$
  where \( p \) is the cost of punishing defectors (\( \delta_{def} \)), and \( r \) is the reward given to cooperators (\( \delta_{coop} \)).

#### 7. **Fairness and Property Rights**
**Equitable Resource Distribution and Ownership Respect**: Fairness and respect for property rights ensure that resources are distributed equitably and that ownership is protected, creating stable social environments.

- **Fair Sharing Payoff**:
  $$
  \pi_i = \frac{R}{N}
  $$
  where \( R \) is the total resource and \( N \) is the number of individuals sharing the resource.

- **Property Rights Payoff**:
  $$
  \pi_i = b_i - c_i \text{ if property is respected}
  $$
  Respect for property leads to stable interactions where theft and disputes are minimized.

### Conclusion

The resilience of cooperative behaviors to invasion by non-cooperative strategies can be understood through the framework of Evolutionarily Stable Strategies (ESS). Each type of cooperation identified by MAC achieves stability through mechanisms that ensure cooperators are favored over defectors in the long term. Whether through kin selection, direct and indirect reciprocity, network effects, group selection, strong reciprocity, or fairness and property rights, these mechanisms promote the persistence and spread of cooperative behaviors in human societies.
