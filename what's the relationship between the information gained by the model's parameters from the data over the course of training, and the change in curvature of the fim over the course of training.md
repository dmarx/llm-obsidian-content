what's the relationship between the information gained by the model's parameters from the data over the course of training, and the change in curvature of the FIM over the course of training


**ASSISTANT**

The relationship between the **information gained by a model's parameters from the data** and the **change in curvature of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)** over the course of training can be understood in terms of **parameter uncertainty reduction**, **sensitivity to data**, and the evolving landscape of the parameter space.

---

### **Key Concepts**

1. **Information Gained by Parameters**:
   - The information gained during training measures how much the data reduces the uncertainty in the parameters. In a Bayesian framework, this corresponds to the reduction in entropy from the prior \( P(\theta) \) to the posterior \( P(\theta \mid D) \):
     $$
     \text{Information Gain} = H(\theta) - H(\theta \mid D).
     $$
   - In non-Bayesian optimization, this can be approximated by observing the concentration of parameters in regions of high likelihood.

2. **Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)**:
   - The FIM, \( I(\theta) \), captures the sensitivity of the likelihood \( P(D \mid \theta) \) to changes in the parameters. Its curvature reflects how peaked or flat the likelihood surface is in different directions.

3. **Curvature of FIM**:
   - The curvature of the FIM reflects the second-order structure of the parameter space. Sharp peaks in the likelihood correspond to high curvature (high Fisher Information), indicating reduced uncertainty in parameter estimates.

---

### **Theoretical Relationship**

The information gained by the model parameters during training is directly tied to the evolution of the FIM's curvature. Here's how:

#### **1. Entropy Reduction and Fisher Information**
- The entropy of the posterior distribution \( P(\theta \mid D) \) is inversely related to the Fisher Information through the approximation:
  $$
  H(\theta \mid D) \propto \frac{1}{2} \log |I(\theta)|,
  $$
  where \( |I(\theta)| \) is the determinant of the FIM.

- As training progresses, the likelihood becomes more concentrated around the optimal parameters, increasing \( |I(\theta)| \) (larger curvature) and reducing \( H(\theta \mid D) \). This reduction in entropy corresponds to the information gained by the parameters from the data.

#### **2. Information Gain and FIM Dynamics**
- The amount of information gained is proportional to the growth in the FIM's curvature. Specifically, as the curvature increases in certain directions, the parameter uncertainty in those directions decreases, reflecting the resolution of ambiguity about those parameters.

#### **3. Sensitivity of Information Gain to Curvature**
- High curvature in \( I(\theta) \) implies that small changes in data significantly affect the likelihood, leading to larger information gain per unit of data.
- Low curvature regions (flat minima) correspond to less sensitivity and slower information gain.

#### **4. Bayesian Interpretation**
- In a Bayesian setting, the FIM is related to the precision of the posterior:
  $$
  I(\theta) \approx \text{Cov}(\theta)^{-1}.
  $$
  As the FIM grows, the posterior becomes more concentrated (lower covariance), reflecting greater confidence in parameter estimates and more information gain.

### **FIM Curvature During Training**

#### **1. Early Training: Low Curvature**
- Parameters are initialized randomly, and the likelihood function is broad and flat.
- The FIM curvature is small, indicating high uncertainty in parameter estimates and low sensitivity to small changes in parameters.
- Information gain is limited at this stage as the model begins exploring the parameter space.

#### **2. Middle Training: Increasing Curvature**
- As the model learns from the data, the likelihood becomes more sharply peaked around the regions of high probability.
- The FIM curvature increases in directions aligned with the data's structure, reducing parameter uncertainty and increasing information gain.
- Information gain is most significant during this phase, as the model resolves ambiguities in parameter estimates.

#### **3. Late Training: Saturation of Curvature**
- Near convergence, the FIM curvature stabilizes. The likelihood surface no longer changes significantly as the model fine-tunes its parameters.
- Information gain slows and plateaus, reflecting diminishing returns from additional data.

### **Practical Relationship Between FIM Curvature and Information Gain**

1. **Trace of the FIM**
   - The **trace of the FIM**, \( \text{Tr}(I(\theta)) \), provides a measure of the total curvature across all parameter directions.
   - The rate of change of \( \text{Tr}(I(\theta)) \) during training correlates with the rate of information gain:
     $$
     \Delta H(\theta \mid D) \propto -\Delta \log \text{Tr}(I(\theta)).
     $$

2. **Eigenvalues of the FIM**
   - The eigenvalues of \( I(\theta) \) indicate curvature along specific directions in parameter space:
     - Large eigenvalues correspond to directions of high certainty (low uncertainty and high curvature).
     - Small eigenvalues indicate directions where uncertainty remains high (flat regions).
   - Information gain in specific directions is proportional to the growth of the corresponding eigenvalues.

3. **Flat vs. Sharp Minima**
   - Models converging to sharp minima exhibit steep growth in FIM curvature, with high eigenvalues dominating.
   - Flat minima correspond to broader likelihood surfaces, where FIM curvature remains moderate, and information gain is spread more evenly across directions.

---

### **Visualizing the Relationship**

#### **Plots to Track During Training**
1. **Entropy vs. Epochs**
   - Plot the entropy of \( P(\theta \mid D) \) (or an approximation) over time to observe information gain.

2. **Trace of the FIM**
   - Track \( \text{Tr}(I(\theta)) \) as a proxy for overall curvature.

3. **FIM Eigenvalue Spectrum**
   - Plot the largest eigenvalues of \( I(\theta) \) to observe how curvature concentrates in specific directions.

#### **Combined Analysis**
- The **rate of change of entropy** should align with the growth in the FIM's trace or leading eigenvalues:
  $$
  \frac{dH(\theta \mid D)}{dt} \propto -\frac{d \text{Tr}(I(\theta))}{dt}.
  $$

### **Example: Gaussian Likelihood**

#### Setup
- Suppose \( D = \{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_N\} \), where \( x_i \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2) \).
- The parameter is \( \mu \), and the Fisher Information is:
  $$
  I(\mu) = \frac{N}{\sigma^2}.
  $$

#### Dynamics
- Early Training:
  - Small \( N \): \( I(\mu) \) is small, indicating high uncertainty in \( \mu \).
  - High entropy: \( H(\mu) \) reflects a broad posterior.
- Middle Training:
  - As \( N \) increases, \( I(\mu) \) grows linearly, reflecting reduced uncertainty.
  - Entropy \( H(\mu) \) decreases logarithmically:
    $$
    H(\mu) \propto -\frac{1}{2} \log I(\mu) \propto -\frac{1}{2} \log N.
    $$
- Late Training:
  - \( I(\mu) \) saturates as \( N \) approaches the dataset size.
  - Entropy stabilizes, and information gain diminishes.

---

### **Conclusion**

The information gained by a model's parameters during training is directly linked to the change in curvature of the Fisher Information Matrix. Early in training, low curvature corresponds to high uncertainty and low information gain. As training progresses, increasing curvature reflects greater sensitivity to parameter changes and higher confidence in parameter estimates, leading to significant information gain. This interplay highlights the FIM's central role in understanding learning dynamics and parameter uncertainty.
