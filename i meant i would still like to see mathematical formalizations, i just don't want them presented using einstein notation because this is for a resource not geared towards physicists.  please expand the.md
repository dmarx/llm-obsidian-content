**USER**

i meant I would still like to see mathematical formalizations, I just don't want them presented using einstein notation because this is for a resource not geared towards physicists.  please expand the mathematical equations you presented earlier into conventional math notation without invoking the einstein notation shorthand


**ASSISTANT**

Certainly! Let's explore the mathematical formalizations related to the Noether current and Noether potential without using Einstein summation convention, and instead, expand all the operations in a more accessible way. This approach aims to maintain the depth of the concepts while making them more approachable to readers not specialized in physics.

### Noether Current without Einstein Notation

The Noether current is a conserved quantity that can be derived from the symmetry of the action in a physical system. In the context of field theory, the action's invariance under a continuous transformation leads to the conservation of certain quantities.

Given a Lagrangian \(L\) that is a function of a set of fields \(\phi_i\) and their derivatives with respect to time \(t\) and space coordinates \(x, y, z\) (denoted as \(\frac{\partial \phi_i}{\partial t}, \frac{\partial \phi_i}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial \phi_i}{\partial y}, \frac{\partial \phi_i}{\partial z}\)), the Noether current associated with a symmetry of the action can be expressed without using Einstein summation convention as follows:

1. **Conservation Equation**: The conservation of the Noether current can be written explicitly as
   \[
   \frac{\partial J^t}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial J^x}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial J^y}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial J^z}{\partial z} = 0
   \]
   Here, \(J^t\) represents the time component of the Noether current, and \(J^x, J^y, J^z\) are the spatial components. This equation says that the rate of change of the Noether current with time plus its divergence (the rate at which the current spreads out from a point) in space is zero, indicating conservation.

### Noether Potential without Einstein Notation

The Noether potential \(Q\) is a mathematical entity that helps in expressing the conserved current \(J\) through a divergence relationship, particularly in the context of gauge theories or field theories like electromagnetism and general relativity.

Given the Noether current \(J\), the Noether potential \(Q^{ij}\) (where \(i, j\) denote spatial coordinates \(x, y, z\), and \(Q^{ij}\) is antisymmetric, meaning \(Q^{ij} = -Q^{ji}\)), the relationship can be expanded as follows:

2. **Relationship Between Noether Current and Noether Potential**: The components of the Noether current can be related to the Noether potential by taking the divergence of \(Q^{ij}\) with respect to spatial coordinates:
   \[
   J^i = \frac{\partial Q^{ij}}{\partial x^j} + \frac{\partial Q^{ik}}{\partial x^k} + \frac{\partial Q^{il}}{\partial x^l}
   \]
   Here, \(x^j, x^k, x^l\) represent the three spatial dimensions (assuming \(i, j, k, l\) each take values \(x, y, z\) but with each combination being distinct), and the repeated index does not imply summation but rather indicates that the derivative of \(Q^{ij}\) with respect to each spatial dimension needs to be considered separately. This formulation captures the essence of the relationship between the Noether current and the potential without relying on compact notation that assumes implicit summation.

By avoiding the Einstein summation convention, we've explicitly shown how the conservation of the Noether current and its relationship with the Noether potential can be understood through the divergence and time variation of these quantities. This approach provides a bridge for those interested in the mathematical beauty of physical laws without the need for specialized notation.
