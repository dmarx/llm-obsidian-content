Degeneracy Lifting


**ASSISTANT**

Degeneracy lifting refers to the phenomenon where degenerate energy levels in a physical system become distinct when a perturbation breaks the symmetry that originally caused the degeneracy. This process reveals finer structure within the system's energy spectrum and often results in splitting of the degenerate states into closely spaced energy levels. Below, we explore the concept in detail through examples and mathematical formalism.

### Key Concepts

1. **Symmetry Breaking**:
   Degeneracy arises from symmetries in the system. When an external perturbation is introduced that breaks these symmetries, the degeneracy is lifted. Common perturbations include external magnetic fields (Zeeman effect), electric fields (Stark effect), or lattice distortions in solids.

2. **Perturbation Theory**:
   Perturbation theory is a mathematical tool used to calculate the effect of a small perturbation on a system's eigenvalues and eigenstates. It is particularly useful for understanding how [[degeneracies]] are lifted.

### Mathematical Formalism

Consider a Hamiltonian \( \hat{H}_0 \) with a degenerate eigenvalue \( E_0 \):
$$
\hat{H}_0 \psi_i = E_0 \psi_i \quad \text{for} \quad i = 1, 2, \ldots, g
$$
where \( g \) is the degree of degeneracy, and \( \psi_i \) are the degenerate eigenstates. Introduce a perturbation \( \hat{V} \) such that the total Hamiltonian becomes:
$$
\hat{H} = \hat{H}_0 + \lambda \hat{V}
$$
where \( \lambda \) is a small parameter.

To first order in perturbation theory, the shift in energy levels is given by the eigenvalues of the matrix formed by the perturbation in the subspace of the degenerate states:
$$
V_{ij} = \langle \psi_i | \hat{V} | \psi_j \rangle
$$

Solving the secular equation:
$$
\det (V - E \mathbb{I}) = 0
$$
gives the new energy levels.

### Examples of Degeneracy Lifting

1. **Zeeman Effect**:
   The Zeeman effect describes the splitting of spectral lines in the presence of a magnetic field. For an electron in an atom, the Hamiltonian with a magnetic field \( \mathbf{B} \) along the \( z \)-axis is:
   $$
   \hat{H}_Z = \hat{H}_0 + \hat{H}_{\text{Zeeman}} = \hat{H}_0 + \gamma B_z \hat{S}_z
   $$
   where \( \gamma \) is the gyromagnetic ratio and \( \hat{S}_z \) is the spin operator along the \( z \)-axis.

   For a state with quantum numbers \( n, l, m \), the energy shift to first order is:
   $$
   \Delta E_m = \langle n, l, m | \gamma B_z \hat{S}_z | n, l, m \rangle = \gamma m B_z
   $$
   This splits the degenerate \( m \)-levels, lifting the degeneracy.

2. **Stark Effect**:
   The Stark effect describes the splitting of atomic energy levels in an external electric field. For a hydrogen atom in a uniform electric field \( \mathbf{E} \) along the \( z \)-axis, the perturbation is:
   $$
   \hat{H}_{\text{Stark}} = -e E_z \hat{z}
   $$
   In the degenerate subspace of the \( n \)-th energy level, this perturbation leads to a matrix with elements:
   $$
   V_{ij} = -e E_z \langle \psi_i | \hat{z} | \psi_j \rangle
   $$
   Diagonalizing this matrix gives the new energy levels, lifting the degeneracy.

3. **Crystal Field Splitting**:
   In solid-state physics, the degeneracy of electronic states in an atom can be lifted by the electrostatic field created by surrounding ions in a crystal lattice. For instance, in an octahedral crystal field, the \( d \)-orbitals of a transition metal ion split into \( t_{2g} \) and \( e_g \) orbitals.

### Example Calculation: Zeeman Effect in Hydrogen Atom

Consider the hydrogen atom with an external magnetic field \( \mathbf{B} \) along the \( z \)-axis. The perturbation Hamiltonian is:
$$
\hat{H}_{\text{Zeeman}} = \mu_B B \hat{L}_z
$$
where \( \mu_B \) is the Bohr magneton and \( \hat{L}_z \) is the orbital angular momentum operator along \( z \).

For a state \( |n, l, m \rangle \), the first-order energy correction is:
$$
\Delta E = \langle n, l, m | \mu_B B \hat{L}_z | n, l, m \rangle = \mu_B B m
$$

Thus, the originally degenerate levels with different \( m \) values split into distinct levels, each separated by \( \mu_B B \).

### Conclusion

Degeneracy lifting is a crucial concept in quantum mechanics and [[condensed matter physics]], revealing the finer structure of energy spectra when symmetries are broken. Understanding this phenomenon allows for deeper insights into the behavior of physical systems under external perturbations and has practical applications in fields such as spectroscopy, magnetic resonance, and material science. By employing perturbation theory and symmetry analysis, one can predict and quantify the splitting of degenerate states, providing a comprehensive understanding of the underlying physics.
