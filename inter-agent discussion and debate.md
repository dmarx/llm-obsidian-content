**ASSISTANT**

the Dynamic Ensemble Generator and run the CLI
dynamic_ensemble_generator = DynamicEnsembleGenerator(available_agents=available_agents)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    dynamic_ensemble_cli()
```

---

### **Step 5: Running the Dynamic Ensemble System**

Now, when the user specifies a task and their preferences (e.g., creativity or accuracy), the **Dynamic Ensemble Generator** will dynamically select the appropriate agents and execute the task.

#### **Example Interaction**:

```bash
Enter your task or question (type 'exit' to quit): Draft a research proposal on renewable energy solutions.
Do you want to prioritize creativity? (yes/no): yes
Do you want to prioritize accuracy? (yes/no): no
Do you want to prioritize clarity and structure? (yes/no): yes

Running task with ResearchAgent...
Running task with WritingAgent...
Running task with CreativeAgent...
Running task with EditorAgent...

Ensemble Results:
ResearchAgent: Renewable energy technologies such as solar, wind, and hydropower are becoming increasingly viable...
WritingAgent: The following proposal outlines the key technologies and policies needed to advance renewable energy solutions...
CreativeAgent: One innovative approach could be to integrate solar panels into urban infrastructure, such as roads and buildings...
EditorAgent: The proposal is well-organized but could benefit from additional emphasis on policy recommendations and societal impact...
```

### **Explanation**:

1. **Research Agent**: Gathers detailed data on renewable energy technologies.
2. **Writing Agent**: Produces a draft of the proposal based on the research.
3. **Creative Agent**: Suggests innovative ideas, adding creative approaches to renewable energy.
4. **Editor Agent**: Ensures the proposal is clear, well-structured, and professional.

The system dynamically selected the **Creative Agent** and **Editor Agent** based on the user’s preferences, skipping the **Fact-Checker Agent** since accuracy was not prioritized.

---

### **Step 6: Extending Dynamic Ensemble Generation**

There are several ways to extend the **Dynamic Ensemble Generation** pattern:
1. **Agent Scoring**: Implement a system where agents are given **confidence scores** or **reliability ratings**, and the generator selects agents based on their past performance.
2. **Adaptive Ensembles**: Allow agents to interact and influence each other’s output during execution, forming more **adaptive ensembles**.
3. **Feedback Loops**: After generating a solution, allow the user or other agents to provide feedback that updates the ensemble for future tasks.

---

### **Learning Outcomes**:

1. **Dynamic Agent Selection**: Students will learn how to dynamically select agents based on task requirements and user preferences, demonstrating the flexibility of multi-agent systems.
   
2. **Task-Specific Customization**: This assignment shows how agents can be customized and tailored to specific problems, improving problem-solving efficiency by focusing on the right expertise.
   
3. **User-Guided Decision-Making**: The system adapts to user input, showing how user preferences can be incorporated into agent-based workflows.

4. **Modular Design**: The pattern reinforces modular design principles, where agents are selected and configured dynamically, allowing for a highly adaptable system.

---

### **Assignment Extension Ideas**:

1. **Agent Performance Monitoring**: Implement a system to track the performance of each agent over time, allowing the **Dynamic Ensemble Generator** to select the best-performing agents for future tasks.
   
2. **Task-Specific Agent Creation**: Allow agents to be created on-the-fly based on the task, generating agents with specific skills or knowledge areas dynamically.
   
3. **Ensemble Efficiency Optimization**: Optimize the ensemble for specific performance metrics, such as speed, accuracy, or resource consumption, by dynamically adjusting the composition.

---

### **Summary**:

In this assignment, students implement the **Dynamic Ensemble Generation Pattern**, where agents are dynamically selected based on user preferences or task requirements. By generating custom ensembles for each task, the system adapts flexibly to different problems and priorities. This pattern demonstrates how multi-agent systems can be optimized for diverse tasks by leveraging dynamic selection, customization, and adaptive workflows.

**ASSISTANT**

### **Assignment: Inter-Agent Discussion and Debate Pattern**

In this assignment, students will implement the **Inter-Agent Discussion and Debate Pattern**, where multiple agents engage in a structured conversation or debate to explore different solutions to a problem or task. Each agent presents its viewpoint or approach, and they collaboratively (or competitively) refine their outputs by **critiquing**, **defending**, or **building upon** each other's suggestions. The goal is to enable agents to **reason together** and produce a more refined, well-rounded final output.

### **Objective**:
1. Teach students how to implement **Inter-Agent Discussion and Debate**, where agents interact, critique, and refine their respective outputs through discussion.
2. Demonstrate how agent collaboration through debate can lead to more well-rounded solutions by exploring multiple viewpoints.
3. Explore strategies for **moderating** and **resolving** disagreements between agents to ensure productive outcomes.

---

### **What Is the Inter-Agent Discussion and Debate Pattern?**

The **Inter-Agent Discussion and Debate Pattern** involves multiple agents **communicating** with one another to present, defend, and challenge ideas or solutions. This collaborative (and sometimes competitive) interaction allows agents to:
1. **Critique** each other's solutions or ideas.
2. **Defend** their own approaches or provide justifications.
3. **Combine** or synthesize multiple viewpoints into a final, consensus-based solution.

#### **Key Characteristics**:
- **Multi-Agent Interaction**: Agents actively engage in dialogue, presenting arguments and counterarguments.
- **Collaborative Refinement**: Agents help refine each other's outputs by highlighting weaknesses, suggesting improvements, and proposing alternative perspectives.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Agents may need to resolve disagreements through structured discussions, facilitated by a **Moderator** or **Mediator Agent**.

#### **Use Cases**:
- **Creative Problem Solving**: Multiple agents propose different approaches to solving a problem, and they collectively discuss and refine the best solution.
- **Code Review**: Agents critique each other’s code, suggesting improvements, finding bugs, or debating optimization strategies.
- **Content Generation**: Agents propose different styles, tones, or structures for a piece of content and refine the final output through discussion.

---

### **Step 1: Defining the Agents for Discussion and Debate**

To implement inter-agent discussion and debate, we need specialized agents with different perspectives. Each agent will bring its own style or approach to a task, which will be discussed, challenged, and refined by other agents.

#### **Defining the Agents**:

```python
class Agent:
    def __init__(self, name, system_prompt_template):
        self.name = name
        self.system_prompt_template = system_prompt_template
        self.history = []  # Initialize conversation history
    
    def get_system_prompt(self):
        """
        Render the system prompt based on the agent's name and role.
        """
        template = Template(self.system_prompt_template)
        return template.render(name=self.name)
    
    def query_openai(self, user_input, max_tokens=100, temperature=0.7, top_p=1.0, **kwargs):
        """
        Send the conversation history to OpenAI and maintain the chat log.
        """
        self.history.append({"role": "user", "content": user_input})
        response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
            model="gpt-3.5-turbo",  # Using a chat model that supports roles
            messages=self.history,
            max_tokens=max_tokens,
            temperature=temperature,
            top_p=top_p,
            **kwargs
        )
        assistant_reply = response.choices[0].message["content"]
        self.history.append({"role": "assistant", "content": assistant_reply})
        return assistant_reply
```

#### **Creating the Agents**:
Each agent will take a different approach to the problem. For example, one agent might prioritize creativity, while another focuses on caution, and a third emphasizes technical accuracy.

```python
# Define system prompts for each agent
creative_prompt = "You are a creative assistant. Provide imaginative and unconventional ideas."
cautious_prompt = "You are a cautious assistant. Provide safe, reliable, and well-tested ideas."
technical_prompt = "You are a technical assistant. Provide precise, data-driven, and logical ideas."

# Create instances of agents with different perspectives
creative_agent = Agent(name="CreativeAgent", system_prompt_template=creative_prompt)
cautious_agent = Agent(name="CautiousAgent", system_prompt_template=cautious_prompt)
technical_agent = Agent(name="TechnicalAgent", system_prompt_template=technical_prompt)

# Store agents in a dictionary for easy access
agents = {
    "CreativeAgent": creative_agent,
    "CautiousAgent": cautious_agent,
    "TechnicalAgent": technical_agent
}
```

---

### **Step 2: Implementing the Discussion and Debate Process**

The **DebateManager** will manage the discussion between agents. Each agent will present its initial solution to a problem, and then the other agents will provide feedback or critique, refining the final solution through this interaction.

#### **DebateManager Implementation**:

```python
class DebateManager:
    def __init__(self, agents):
        """
        Initialize the Debate Manager with the available agents.
        
        Arguments:
        - agents: A dictionary mapping agent names to Agent objects.
        """
        self.agents = agents

    def initiate_discussion(self, user_input):
        """
        Initiate a discussion by having each agent propose their solution.
        
        Arguments:
        - user_input: The task or question provided by the user.
        
        Returns:
        - A dictionary of the initial responses from each agent.
        """
        initial_responses = {}
        
        for agent_name, agent in self.agents.items():
            print(f"{agent_name} is generating a response...")
            response = agent.query_openai(user_input)
            initial_responses[agent_name] = response
        
        return initial_responses

    def conduct_debate(self, initial_responses):
        """
        Conduct the debate by allowing agents to critique and discuss each other's responses.
        
        Arguments:
        - initial_responses: A dictionary of the initial responses from each agent.
        
        Returns:
        - A final debated response after agents refine their suggestions.
        """
        debated_responses = {}
        
        # Step 1: Each agent critiques the other agents' initial responses
        for agent_name, agent in self.agents.items():
            for other_agent_name, other_response in initial_responses.items():
                if agent_name != other_agent_name:
                    critique_input = f"Critique the following response: '{other_response}'"
                    print(f"{agent_name} is critiquing {other_agent_name}'s response...")
                    critique = agent.query_openai(critique_input)
                    debated_responses[other_agent_name] = debated_responses.get(other_agent_name, []) + [critique]

        # Step 2: Aggregate critiques and synthesize a final response for each agent
        final_responses = {}
        for agent_name, critiques in debated_responses.items():
            final_responses[agent_name] = f"Final refined response for {agent_name}: {initial_responses[agent_name]}\n\nCritiques:\n" + "\n".join(critiques)
        
        return final_responses
```

---

### **Step 3: Implementing the CLI for Inter-Agent Discussion**

We will now create a simple CLI where the user can provide a task or question, and the agents will engage in a discussion to refine their responses.

```python
def debate_cli():
    print("Welcome to the Inter-Agent Debate System!\n")
    
    while True:
        user_input = input("Enter your task or question (type 'exit' to quit): ")
        
        if user_input.lower() == "exit":
            break
        
        # Step 1: Initiate the discussion and gather initial responses
        initial_responses = debate_manager.initiate_discussion(user_input)
        
        print("\nInitial Responses:")
        for agent_name, response in initial_responses.items():
            print(f"{agent_name}: {response}")
        
        # Step 2: Conduct the debate and refine the responses
        final_responses = debate_manager.conduct_debate(initial_responses)
        
        print("\nDebated Responses:")
        for agent_name, final_response in final_responses.items():
            print(f"{final_response}\n")

# Create an instance of the Debate Manager and run the CLI
debate_manager = DebateManager(agents=agents)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    debate_cli()
```

---

### **Step 4: Running the Inter-Agent Debate System**

When the user provides a task, each agent will present an initial response. The agents will then critique each other’s responses, and the **DebateManager** will synthesize a final output based on the feedback.

#### **Example Interaction**:

```bash
Enter your task or question (type 'exit' to quit): How should we address the global water crisis?
CreativeAgent is generating a response...
CautiousAgent is generating a response...
TechnicalAgent is generating a response...

Initial Responses:
CreativeAgent: We could develop large-scale atmospheric water generators that harvest moisture from the air to provide clean drinking water.
CautiousAgent: The safest approach is to improve existing water infrastructure, reducing waste and increasing efficiency.
TechnicalAgent: A combination of desalination plants and advanced water recycling systems would address both supply shortages and sustainability.

CreativeAgent is critiquing CautiousAgent's response...
CreativeAgent is critiquing TechnicalAgent's response...
CautiousAgent is critiquing CreativeAgent's response...
CautiousAgent is critiquing TechnicalAgent's response...
TechnicalAgent is critiquing CreativeAgent's response...
TechnicalAgent is critiquing CautiousAgent's response...

Debated Responses:
Final refined response for CreativeAgent: We could develop large-scale atmospheric water generators that harvest moisture from the air
