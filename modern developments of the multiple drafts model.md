modern developments of the Multiple Drafts model


**ASSISTANT**

Since Daniel Dennett introduced the *Multiple Drafts Model* in 1991, modern developments in neuroscience, cognitive science, and philosophy have engaged with and evolved the model. Although Dennett's core ideas about consciousness as a distributed, parallel-processing system have been influential, several new theories and research areas have expanded or reinterpreted these concepts. Some developments build on the distributed processing framework, while others modify aspects of Dennett's ideas in response to empirical findings or philosophical debates.

### 1. **Global Workspace Theory (GWT)**
One of the most closely related modern theories to the *Multiple Drafts Model* is *Global Workspace Theory* (GWT), proposed by [[Bernard Baars]] in the 1980s and later expanded by cognitive scientists like [[Stanislas Dehaene]]. GWT posits that consciousness arises when information from distributed brain processes is integrated into a "global workspace" or "workspace neurons" that broadcast the information across the brain, making it accessible to various cognitive systems.

#### Key Similarities:
- **Distributed Processing**: Like Dennett’s Multiple Drafts, GWT recognizes that information processing in the brain is distributed across various modules or regions. Different sensory modalities and cognitive functions process information in parallel before it becomes conscious.
  
- **No Cartesian Theater**: GWT also rejects the idea of a centralized "observer" or *Cartesian Theater*. Consciousness is not about presenting a unified image to a central observer but rather about making information globally available to different systems.

#### Key Differences:
- **Global Workspace**: GWT introduces a mechanism (the global workspace) in which certain information gets selected for widespread broadcasting across brain regions. This idea of a "workspace" contrasts with Dennett’s rejection of a single place where conscious information resides. GWT suggests that there is a central system, though not an "observer," where integration occurs.
  
- **Serial Processing**: While Multiple Drafts emphasizes the parallel and competitive nature of drafts, GWT suggests that once information enters the global workspace, it is handled in a more serial manner, with the workspace dominating cognitive resources.

GWT has gained significant empirical support from neuroimaging studies, particularly through work by Dehaene, who demonstrated that certain brain regions (like the prefrontal cortex) show heightened activity when information becomes consciously accessible. This suggests that there might be more coherence and centralized integration in conscious experience than Dennett’s model originally suggested.

### 2. **Integrated Information Theory (IIT)**
*Integrated Information Theory* (IIT), developed by [[Giulio Tononi]], represents another modern development in consciousness studies that has similarities with, but also crucial differences from, the Multiple Drafts Model. IIT attempts to provide both a neuroscientific and philosophical explanation of consciousness, focusing on the *integration* and *information processing* within the brain.

#### Key Similarities:
- **Distributed Processing**: IIT, like the Multiple Drafts Model, acknowledges that the brain processes information in a highly distributed manner, involving many interconnected regions.

#### Key Differences:
- **Mathematical Formalism**: IIT proposes a mathematical framework, with a key concept being the *Φ* (phi) value, which quantifies the degree of information integration within a system. Higher integration (higher Φ) is equated with higher levels of consciousness. Dennett’s model does not attempt such a formalized measure of consciousness and is more focused on the narrative construction of multiple drafts.

- **Emphasis on Experience**: While Dennett downplays the importance of *qualia* and focuses on the functional aspects of consciousness, IIT is specifically designed to account for the subjective *what-it-is-like* experience, which it treats as fundamental to consciousness. This focus on subjective experience is closer to what Dennett critiques as *phenomenal consciousness*.

IIT offers an alternative to Dennett’s eliminative stance on subjective experience, attempting to explain both the distribution of information and why certain configurations of brain activity correspond to conscious experience.

### 3. **Predictive Coding and Bayesian Brain Models**
*Predictive coding* and *Bayesian brain models* have become central to modern neuroscience, offering insights into how the brain processes information and generates perception. These models focus on the brain’s ability to form predictions about sensory inputs and continuously update these predictions based on incoming information (i.e., prediction errors).

#### Key Similarities:
- **Constant Revision**: Predictive coding aligns with Dennett’s idea that consciousness is the result of multiple, constantly updated drafts. In predictive coding models, the brain generates hypotheses or predictions about the world and continuously revises them based on new sensory information, much like Dennett’s drafts are revised and updated over time.

- **No Final Draft**: Similar to Dennett’s rejection of a *Cartesian Theater*, predictive coding models suggest that perception and consciousness are ongoing processes without a single "finished" or complete version of reality. The brain is always in the process of generating and updating models based on available evidence.

#### Key Differences:
- **Emphasis on Prediction**: Predictive coding adds an element that Dennett’s model doesn’t emphasize: the role of prediction and expectation in perception. The brain is seen as a *Bayesian* machine, constantly trying to minimize prediction errors. This predictive mechanism might be another layer of complexity that was not fully developed in the Multiple Drafts Model.

- **Hierarchical Structure**: Predictive coding models introduce a hierarchical structure where low-level sensory inputs are compared to high-level predictions. Consciousness, in this view, might emerge from the integration of these hierarchically organized predictions, a mechanism more structured than Dennett’s decentralized drafts.

### 4. **Attention Schema Theory (AST)**
Developed by [[Michael Graziano]], *Attention Schema Theory* (AST) presents another model that attempts to explain consciousness as an emergent property of information processing, particularly focusing on how the brain models its own attentional processes.

#### Key Similarities:
- **Emergence of Consciousness**: Both AST and the Multiple Drafts Model suggest that consciousness is an emergent property of various neural processes and not a single event or state that occurs in a particular place.

- **Distributed Attention**: Like Dennett’s distributed drafts, Graziano’s theory emphasizes that attention is spread across different brain regions, and the brain creates a simplified model of its own attentional state to generate the experience of being conscious.

#### Key Differences:
- **Attention as the Key**: AST puts attention at the core of consciousness, suggesting that the brain constructs a simplified model (the *attention schema*) that represents its focus of attention and thereby generates the experience of consciousness. Dennett’s Multiple Drafts Model does not give special status to attention; it treats all mental content as competing drafts, with some gaining prominence without explicit focus on attentional mechanisms.

- **Simplified Self-Model**: AST claims that part of what we call consciousness is the brain’s model of itself paying attention. This model is a simplified, efficient version of the complex neural processes involved in actual attention. In contrast, Dennett’s model does not emphasize the brain’s modeling of its own processes to generate conscious experience.

### 5. **Neuroscientific Research on Consciousness**
Empirical research in neuroscience has increasingly been able to test and expand upon ideas related to the Multiple Drafts Model. Modern tools like fMRI, EEG, and optogenetics have allowed researchers to investigate how conscious states emerge from distributed brain processes.

#### Key Developments:
- **Neural Correlates of Consciousness (NCCs)**: While Dennett’s model avoided positing specific neural structures for consciousness, modern research focuses heavily on identifying the neural correlates of consciousness (NCCs)—the brain regions and networks whose activity correlates with conscious experience. Studies have identified areas like the prefrontal cortex, parietal regions, and thalamus as key players in the emergence of consciousness, particularly in integrating sensory and cognitive processes. This supports the distributed processing aspect of Dennett’s model but also adds specificity in terms of which brain networks are involved.

- **Large-Scale Brain Networks**: Research into *default mode*, *salience*, and *executive control* networks shows that consciousness likely depends on the interaction of large-scale brain networks rather than isolated regions. This supports Dennett’s idea that consciousness emerges from distributed processes, though modern neuroscience adds a level of precision that was unavailable in the early 1990s.

### 6. **Illusionism and Dennett’s Influence**
A more recent development in philosophy of mind is *illusionism*, particularly advocated by philosophers like [[Keith Frankish]], who argue that consciousness, as we intuitively understand it, is an illusion. This position is directly inspired by Dennett’s work, especially his emphasis on debunking *qualia* and his idea that much of what we think of as subjective experience is the result of cognitive processing that can be explained functionally.

#### Key Points:
- **Consciousness as a Cognitive Illusion**: Illusionists argue that consciousness (especially *phenomenal consciousness*) is not a fundamental feature of the brain but rather a cognitive illusion—a product of the brain’s tendency to generate simplified narratives and self-models. This idea is consistent with Dennett’s claim that consciousness is a "user illusion"—a helpful but not ontologically deep phenomenon.
  
- **Expanding Dennett’s Anti-Qualia Argument**: Frankish and other illusionists expand on Dennett’s critique of *qualia* by providing more detailed accounts of how cognitive systems generate the *appearance* of conscious experience without invoking any mysterious, irreducible properties.

### Conclusion
Since Dennett’s *Multiple Drafts Model* was introduced, numerous developments in neuroscience and philosophy have either extended or challenged its framework. Theories like *Global Workspace Theory*, *Integrated Information Theory*, and *Predictive Coding* offer alternative ways to think about distributed processing and consciousness, while empirical research continues to map out the neural basis of conscious states.
