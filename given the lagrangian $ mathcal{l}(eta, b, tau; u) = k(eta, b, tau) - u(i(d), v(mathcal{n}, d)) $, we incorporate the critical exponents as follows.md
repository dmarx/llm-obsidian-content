what forms might we expect F to take?


**ASSISTANT**

The scaling function \(F\) in the expression for \(V(\mathcal{N}, D)\) reflects the complex interplay of hyperparameters (\(\eta\) and either \(\tau\) or \(B\)) near their critical values, particularly in the context of triggering phenomena like grokking in neural network learning dynamics. The form that \(F\) might take can be influenced by various factors, including the specific characteristics of the neural network, the dataset, and the nature of the learning task. Below are some possible forms for \(F\) and the intuitions behind them:

### 1. Power-Law Form

A power-law form for \(F\) would suggest a direct, scale-invariant relationship between the changes in hyperparameters and the variance explained by the model:

\[ F(x, y) = Ax^a y^b \]

where \(A\) is a constant, and \(a, b\) are exponents that describe how changes in \(\eta\) and \(\tau\) (or \(B\)) scale with respect to each other. This form implies that the effects of hyperparameter adjustments near the critical point are multiplicative and that their impact on learning dynamics can be understood in terms of simple scaling laws.

### 2. Exponential Form

An exponential form for \(F\) might capture more dramatic effects of hyperparameter changes near the critical point, especially in scenarios where small changes in \(\eta\) or \(\tau\) lead to significant leaps in learning performance:

\[ F(x, y) = A \exp(Bx + Cy) \]

where \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) are constants. This form could be particularly relevant for modeling the sudden onset of grokking, representing how minute adjustments in hyperparameters can precipitate rapid improvements in model understanding.

### 3. Logistic Form

A logistic form for \(F\) could model the saturation effects as the model approaches the limits of its learning capacity, reflecting a bounded improvement in variance explained:

\[ F(x, y) = \frac{L}{1 + \exp(-k(x + y - x_0))} \]

where \(L\) is the curve's maximum value, \(k\) is the logistic growth rate, and \(x_0\) represents the logistic midpoint. This form is useful for scenarios where improvements in learning performance experience rapid growth followed by a plateau, typical of many training processes.

### 4. Polynomial Form

A polynomial form for \(F\) could capture nonlinear interactions between hyperparameters and their effects on learning dynamics:

\[ F(x, y) = a + bx + cy + dx^2 + ey^2 + fxy \]

This form allows for a rich representation of how combined changes in \(\eta\) and \(\tau\) (or \(B\)) influence learning outcomes, accommodating both direct and interaction effects.

### 5. Piecewise Function

A piecewise function for \(F\) could reflect different regimes of learning behavior depending on the proximity to the critical point:

\[ F(x, y) = \begin{cases} 
g(x, y) & \text{if } x, y < \text{threshold} \\
h(x, y) & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} \]

where \(g\) and \(h\) represent different functional forms applicable under varying conditions. This approach can model transitions in learning dynamics, such as the shift from steady progress to rapid grokking.

### Conclusion

The specific form of \(F\) that best describes the relationship between hyperparameters and learning outcomes near criticality depends on empirical observations and theoretical considerations. Exploring different forms for \(F\) through both simulation and analysis of real training dynamics can provide deeper insights into the principles governing neural network learning, particularly as they relate to phenomena like grokking.
