### Quantifying Entropy Changes in Parameters During Model Training

During the training of a machine learning model, the **entropy of the parameters** quantifies the uncertainty or variability in their values. Monitoring how this entropy evolves provides insights into the learning process, such as how parameter uncertainty is reduced as the model fits the data and converges to a solution.

---

### **1. Defining Entropy of Parameters**

Let \( \theta \) denote the parameters of the model. In probabilistic modeling, the parameters are often treated as random variables with a distribution \( P(\theta) \), representing either:
1. **Uncertainty in Bayesian Inference**: \( P(\theta) \) is the posterior or prior distribution over parameters.
2. **Empirical Distribution in Optimization**: \( P(\theta) \) may reflect the distribution of parameter estimates over multiple training runs or updates.

The entropy of \( \theta \), \( H(\theta) \), is defined as:
$$
H(\theta) = -\int P(\theta) \log P(\theta) \, d\theta.
$$

For discrete cases (e.g., quantized parameter values):
$$
H(\theta) = -\sum_{\theta} P(\theta) \log P(\theta).
$$

### **2. Entropy Dynamics During Training**

#### **Initial Phase: High Entropy**
- **Before training**, parameter values are typically initialized randomly (e.g., Gaussian initialization).
- The distribution \( P(\theta) \) reflects this uncertainty, resulting in **high entropy**:
  - Bayesian models: The prior \( P(\theta) \) is often chosen to reflect maximal ignorance (e.g., a uniform or broad Gaussian distribution).
  - Non-Bayesian models: Parameters are randomly initialized, and their entropy is high due to large variability.

#### **Training Phase: Decreasing Entropy**
- **During training**, the model updates parameters \( \theta \) to minimize a loss function (e.g., negative log-likelihood or MSE). The parameter values concentrate around those that fit the data.
- In Bayesian terms:
  - The prior \( P(\theta) \) is updated to the posterior \( P(\theta \mid D) \), reducing uncertainty based on the observed data \( D \).
  - \( H(\theta) \) decreases as the posterior becomes more peaked around the optimal parameters.
- In optimization terms:
  - Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or other methods progressively reduce the variability of parameter updates, leading to a concentration of parameters near a local minimum.

#### **Convergence Phase: Low Entropy**
- At convergence, \( P(\theta) \) becomes sharply peaked:
  - In Bayesian terms: The posterior \( P(\theta \mid D) \) is dominated by a small region of high probability, reflecting the model's high confidence in parameter values.
  - In non-Bayesian optimization: Parameters stabilize, and entropy effectively reduces to zero if no regularization or noise is present.

### **3. Methods to Quantify Parameter Entropy**

#### **1. Directly from a Posterior Distribution**
- In Bayesian learning, \( P(\theta) \) is explicitly modeled. Tools include:
  - Monte Carlo sampling (e.g., Markov Chain Monte Carlo, MCMC).
  - Variational inference, which approximates \( P(\theta) \) with a simpler distribution \( Q(\theta) \).

The entropy is computed as:
$$
H(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{Q(\theta)}[-\log Q(\theta)].
$$

#### **2. Empirical Estimation from SGD Trajectories**
- In non-Bayesian training (e.g., SGD):
  - Track the parameters \( \theta_t \) across iterations \( t \).
  - Estimate an empirical distribution \( P(\theta) \) from the parameter trajectories (e.g., kernel density estimation).

The entropy can then be estimated as:
$$
H(\theta) = -\sum_i \hat{P}(\theta_i) \log \hat{P}(\theta_i),
$$
where \( \hat{P}(\theta_i) \) is the empirical probability density of parameter values.

#### **3. Using Fisher Information**
- In optimization, the **Fisher Information Matrix** \( I(\theta) \) approximates the curvature of the loss function around the parameters:
  $$
  I(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{D} \left[ \nabla_\theta \log P(D \mid \theta) \nabla_\theta \log P(D \mid \theta)^T \right].
  $$
- A sharper \( P(\theta) \) (lower entropy) corresponds to a higher Fisher Information.

### **4. Tracking Changes in Entropy**

Entropy can be tracked over epochs or iterations of training to understand learning dynamics.

#### **Key Insights**
1. **Early Training**
   - Entropy decreases rapidly as the model discovers structure in the data.
   - Regularization (e.g., weight decay, dropout) slows the rate of entropy reduction, encouraging broader exploration of parameter space.

2. **Later Training**
   - Entropy plateaus or decreases more slowly, reflecting convergence to a solution.
   - In Bayesian terms, the posterior distribution stabilizes.

3. **Overfitting**
   - If the model starts to overfit, entropy may decrease excessively, indicating overconfidence in specific parameter values.

#### **Visualization**
Entropy can be plotted over training time:
- \( x \)-axis: Epochs or iterations.
- \( y \)-axis: \( H(\theta) \).

---

### **5. Practical Considerations**

#### **1. Regularization Effects**
- Regularization methods like \( L_2 \)-norm penalties, dropout, or Bayesian priors slow the reduction in entropy, encouraging broader exploration and preventing overfitting.

#### **2. Noise in SGD**
- Stochasticity in SGD introduces noise into parameter updates, maintaining a nonzero [[residual entropy]] even at convergence.

#### **3. Flat vs. Sharp Minima**
- A model converging to a **flat minimum** (parameters spread across a broad region of near-optimal values) retains higher entropy than one converging to a **sharp minimum**.

---

### **6. Applications of Parameter Entropy Dynamics**

#### **1. Understanding Model Generalization**
- Models that generalize well often converge to flatter minima, corresponding to higher entropy at convergence.

#### **2. Early Stopping**
- Tracking entropy provides a natural stopping criterion: training can be halted when entropy plateaus, avoiding overfitting.

#### **3. Interpreting Model Confidence**
- In Bayesian models, high [[residual entropy]] in parameters indicates uncertainty, guiding predictions and decision-making.

#### **4. Exploring Training Dynamics**
- Analyzing entropy dynamics provides insights into how the model explores parameter space, adapts to data, and converges.

---

### **7. Mathematical Example**

#### **Setup**
- Consider a Bayesian linear regression model:
  $$
  P(\theta \mid D) \propto P(D \mid \theta) P(\theta),
  $$
  where \( P(\theta) \) is a Gaussian prior.

#### **Initial Entropy**
- Prior \( P(\theta) = \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 I) \):
  $$
  H(\theta) = \frac{d}{2} \log (2\pi e \sigma^2),
  $$
  where \( d \) is the number of parameters.

#### **Entropy During Training**
- As data is incorporated, the posterior \( P(\theta \mid D) \) becomes:
  $$
  P(\theta \mid D) = \mathcal{N}(\mu_\theta, \Sigma_\theta),
  $$
  with covariance \( \Sigma_\theta \). The entropy reduces to:
  $$
  H(\theta \mid D) = \frac{d}{2} \log (2\pi e) + \frac{1}{2} \log |\Sigma_\theta|.
  $$

#### **Final Convergence**
- \( \Sigma_\theta \) shrinks, reducing entropy and reflecting reduced uncertainty.

---

### **Conclusion**

The entropy of model parameters evolves as a function of learning progress, reflecting the trade-off between exploration and convergence. Quantifying this entropy provides a window into the training dynamics, helping to analyze generalization, overfitting, and uncertainty. Whether using Bayesian tools or empirical approximations, monitoring parameter entropy enhances our understanding of machine learning models.
