Renormalization in Gauge Theories


**ASSISTANT**

Renormalization is a crucial process in quantum field theory that allows us to deal with infinities that arise in the calculations of physical quantities. In gauge theories, renormalization ensures that the predictions of the theory remain finite and consistent with observations, despite the presence of ultraviolet (UV) divergences. 

## Overview

### Renormalization in Quantum Field Theory

In quantum field theory, the process of renormalization involves:
1. **Regularization**: Introducing a cutoff or a regulator to control divergences.
2. **Renormalization**: Absorbing the infinities into redefined (renormalized) parameters of the theory.
3. **Renormalization Group (RG)**: Studying how these parameters change with the energy scale.

### Gauge Theories

Gauge theories, such as Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) and Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), require careful treatment during renormalization to preserve gauge invariance.

## Regularization

### Techniques

Several regularization techniques are used in gauge theories:
- **Dimensional Regularization**: Extending spacetime to \(d = 4 - \epsilon\) dimensions to regularize integrals.
- **Pauli-Villars Regularization**: Introducing heavy auxiliary fields to cancel divergences.
- **Cutoff Regularization**: Introducing a cutoff \(\Lambda\) to limit the momentum integrals.

Dimensional regularization is the most commonly used technique in gauge theories due to its compatibility with gauge invariance.

## Renormalization Procedure

### Bare and Renormalized Quantities

In renormalization, bare quantities (with divergences) are related to renormalized quantities (finite) through renormalization constants. For a gauge field theory with fields \(A_\mu\), fermion fields \(\psi\), and coupling constant \(g\), the relations are:

$$
A_\mu^0 = Z_A^{1/2} A_\mu, \quad \psi^0 = Z_\psi^{1/2} \psi, \quad g^0 = Z_g g
$$

where \(Z_A\), \(Z_\psi\), and \(Z_g\) are the renormalization constants for the gauge field, fermion field, and coupling constant, respectively.

### Renormalized Lagrangian

The renormalized Lagrangian includes counterterms to absorb the divergences:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{ren}} = \mathcal{L} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{ct}}
$$

where \(\mathcal{L}\) is the original Lagrangian and \(\mathcal{L}_{\text{ct}}\) contains counterterms.

### Gauge Invariance

Maintaining gauge invariance during renormalization is crucial. Dimensional regularization helps preserve gauge invariance by maintaining the form of gauge symmetries in \(d\) dimensions.

### Example: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)

In QED, the renormalized Lagrangian is:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{ren}} = -\frac{1}{4} Z_3 F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu} + Z_2 \bar{\psi}(i\gamma^\mu \partial_\mu - Z_m m) \psi + e Z_1 \bar{\psi} \gamma^\mu \psi A_\mu
$$

where \(Z_3\), \(Z_2\), \(Z_m\), and \(Z_1\) are the renormalization constants for the photon field, fermion field, fermion mass, and the interaction term, respectively.

## Renormalization Group

The Renormalization Group (RG) studies how the parameters of a theory evolve with changes in the energy scale \(\mu\). This evolution is described by the beta function \(\beta(g)\) and the anomalous dimensions \(\gamma\) of fields.

### Beta Function

The beta function describes the running of the coupling constant \(g\) with the energy scale \(\mu\):

$$
\beta(g) = \mu \frac{d g}{d \mu}
$$

For QED, the one-loop beta function is:

$$
\beta(e) = \frac{e^3}{12\pi^2}
$$

For QCD, the one-loop beta function is:

$$
\beta(g) = -\frac{g^3}{16\pi^2} \left( 11 - \frac{2}{3} n_f \right)
$$

where \(n_f\) is the number of fermion flavors.

### Anomalous Dimensions

The anomalous dimension \(\gamma\) describes how the field strength renormalization constants \(Z_\phi\) vary with the energy scale:

$$
\gamma_\phi = \mu \frac{d \ln Z_\phi}{d \mu}
$$

### RG Equations

The RG equations describe the flow of the coupling constants and field strengths with energy, providing insights into the behavior of the theory at different scales.

## Applications

### Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)

In QED, renormalization removes divergences from the electron self-energy, vacuum polarization, and vertex corrections, leading to finite and measurable predictions for physical quantities like the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron.

### Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)

In QCD, renormalization explains the phenomenon of asymptotic freedom, where the coupling constant decreases at high energies, allowing quarks and gluons to interact weakly at short distances.

### Electroweak Theory

Renormalization is essential in the electroweak theory to handle the divergences arising from the Higgs mechanism and the interactions between the gauge bosons and fermions.

### Effective Field Theories

Renormalization techniques are used to construct effective field theories, which describe low-energy phenomena without requiring a complete understanding of high-energy physics.
