## State-Action-Reward-State-Action (SARSA) in Reinforcement Learning

### Overview

State-Action-Reward-State-Action (SARSA) is an on-policy temporal difference (TD) learning algorithm used in [[reinforcement learning]] (RL). It aims to learn the action-value function, \(Q(s, a)\), which estimates the expected return (cumulative reward) of taking action \(a\) in state \(s\) and following the current policy thereafter. SARSA is called on-policy because it updates the Q-values based on the actions taken by the current policy.

### Key Concepts

1. **Action-Value Function (\(Q(s, a)\))**: Estimates the expected return starting from state \(s\), taking action \(a\), and following the policy thereafter.
2. **On-Policy Learning**: Learns the value of the policy being followed by the agent, as opposed to the optimal policy.
3. **Temporal Difference (TD) Learning**: Combines ideas from Monte Carlo methods and dynamic programming to update value estimates based on observed rewards and estimated future values.

### SARSA Update Rule

The SARSA update rule modifies the Q-value of a state-action pair based on the observed reward and the Q-value of the subsequent state-action pair:

\[
Q(s_t, a_t) \leftarrow Q(s_t, a_t) + \alpha \left( R_{t+1} + \gamma Q(s_{t+1}, a_{t+1}) - Q(s_t, a_t) \right)
\]

where:
- \(s_t\) is the current state.
- \(a_t\) is the action taken.
- \(R_{t+1}\) is the reward received after taking action \(a_t\).
- \(s_{t+1}\) is the next state.
- \(a_{t+1}\) is the next action taken from \(s_{t+1}\) according to the current policy.
- \(\alpha\) is the learning rate.
- \(\gamma\) is the discount factor.

### Algorithm Steps

1. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize \(Q(s, a)\) arbitrarily for all \(s \in S\) and \(a \in A\).
   - Set learning rate \(\alpha\) and discount factor \(\gamma\).

2. **Loop for each episode**:
   - Initialize state \(s\).
   - Choose action \(a\) from state \(s\) using the policy derived from \(Q\) (e.g., \(\epsilon\)-greedy).
   - Loop for each step of the episode:
     - Take action \(a\), observe reward \(R\) and next state \(s'\).
     - Choose action \(a'\) from state \(s'\) using the policy derived from \(Q\) (e.g., \(\epsilon\)-greedy).
     - Update \(Q(s, a)\):
       
       \[
       Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha \left( R + \gamma Q(s', a') - Q(s, a) \right)
       \]
     - Set \(s \leftarrow s'\) and \(a \leftarrow a'\).
   - End when \(s\) is a terminal state.

### Exploration Policy: \(\epsilon\)-Greedy

The \(\epsilon\)-greedy policy is commonly used to balance exploration and exploitation:

\[
a =
\begin{cases} 
\text{random action} & \text{with probability } \epsilon \\
\arg\max_a Q(s, a) & \text{with probability } 1 - \epsilon
\end{cases}
\]

### Example: SARSA Algorithm in Python

```python
import numpy as np
import gym

env = gym.make('FrozenLake-v0')
Q = np.zeros((env.observation_space.n, env.action_space.n))
alpha = 0.1
gamma = 0.99
epsilon = 0.1

def choose_action(state):
    if np.random.rand() < epsilon:
        return env.action_space.sample()
    else:
        return np.argmax(Q[state])

for episode in range(1000):
    state = env.reset()
    action = choose_action(state)
    done = False
    while not done:
        next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
        next_action = choose_action(next_state)
        Q[state, action] = Q[state, action] + alpha * (reward + gamma * Q[next_state, next_action] - Q[state, action])
        state = next_state
        action = next_action

print("Trained Q-Table using SARSA:")
print(Q)
```

### Comparison with Q-Learning

1. **On-Policy vs. Off-Policy**:
   - SARSA is an on-policy algorithm, meaning it updates the Q-values based on the action actually taken by the current policy.
   - Q-Learning is an off-policy algorithm, meaning it updates the Q-values based on the maximum Q-value of the next state, regardless of the action taken by the policy.

2. **Update Rule**:
   - SARSA: \(Q(s_t, a_t) \leftarrow Q(s_t, a_t) + \alpha \left( R_{t+1} + \gamma Q(s_{t+1}, a_{t+1}) - Q(s_t, a_t) \right)\)
   - Q-Learning: \(Q(s_t, a_t) \leftarrow Q(s_t, a_t) + \alpha \left( R_{t+1} + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s_{t+1}, a') - Q(s_t, a_t) \right)\)

3. **Behavior**:
   - SARSA tends to be more conservative and safer, as it updates based on the policy's actions, leading to smoother learning.
   - Q-Learning is more aggressive and optimistic, as it updates based on the maximum possible reward, potentially leading to faster learning but with more variance.

### Applications of SARSA

1. **Game Playing**: Learning strategies for board games and video games.
2. **Robotics**: Learning control policies for navigation and manipulation tasks.
3. **Finance**: Optimizing trading strategies and portfolio management.
4. **Healthcare**: Personalizing treatment plans and optimizing drug discovery.
5. **Recommendation Systems**: Enhancing user recommendations and content personalization.

### Conclusion

SARSA is a powerful and intuitive [[reinforcement learning]] algorithm that learns optimal policies by updating the action-value function based on the actions taken by the current policy. Its on-policy nature makes it more stable and reliable in certain environments compared to off-policy methods like Q-Learning. Understanding and implementing SARSA is essential for developing effective RL solutions across various applications.
