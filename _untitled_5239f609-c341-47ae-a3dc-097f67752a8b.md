**ASSISTANT**

to engage in the addictive behavior, the brain can learn to **dissociate** the cues from the expectation of reward, weakening the sensitization process.

Over time, this approach helps reduce the individual’s cravings when exposed to real-world triggers, making it easier to avoid relapse.

##### C. **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**
**Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)** helps individuals recognize and reframe the cognitive distortions that arise from tolerance and sensitization:
- CBT teaches individuals to **challenge the urge** to increase substance use due to tolerance by emphasizing the long-term consequences of their actions.
- It also provides strategies for managing **cue-induced cravings**, such as avoiding triggers, practicing mindfulness, and using cognitive restructuring to resist the urge to relapse.

#### Conclusion

**Tolerance** and **sensitization** are two key neuroadaptive processes that fuel the cycle of addiction. Tolerance leads to the escalation of substance use, as the brain becomes less responsive to dopamine and other reward signals, while sensitization heightens the brain’s response to cues associated with the addictive behavior, making relapse more likely. These neurobiological adaptations interact with **hyperbolic discounting**, amplifying the individual’s focus on immediate rewards and driving time-inconsistent preferences that prioritize short-term gratification over long-term well-being. Understanding these processes provides critical insight into the persistence of addiction and informs treatment strategies that can mitigate the effects of tolerance and sensitization, thereby reducing the likelihood of relapse.
